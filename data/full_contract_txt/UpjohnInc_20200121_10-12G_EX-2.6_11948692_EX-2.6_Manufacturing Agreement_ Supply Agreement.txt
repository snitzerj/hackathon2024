2.4 Forecasts and Purchase Orders. (a) VMR Products Forecasting and Purchase Orders. With respect to the VMR Products, the processes and mechanisms by which Forecasts are prepared and Purchase Orders are issued shall be as set forth in the applicable Facility Addenda and the remainder of this Section 2.4 shall not apply with respect to such VMR Products as applicable. (b) Make to Order Product Forecasts. Except as otherwise set forth in a Facility Addendum, in each calendar month during the Term of a Facility Addendum, Customer shall provide to Manufacturer a rolling Product SKU-level forecast of its estimated requirements of Make to Order Products for the eighteen (18)-month period commencing with the month in which such forecast is provided (each, a "Forecast"). In the event Customer delivers a Forecast where the allocation of Product requirements over the time period of the Forecast are not consistent with historical trends, at Manufacturer's request, the Parties will meet to discuss the Forecast in good faith in the context of previous allocations of Product requirements. Such Forecasts represent Customer's reasonable estimates of the quantity of Products it will require during the applicable period covered by each such Forecast. Except as otherwise set forth in a Facility Addendum, each Forecast shall be a non-binding forecast and for informational purposes only, except that: (i) the portion of such Forecast covering the first three (3) calendar months reflected therein (the "Binding Forecast Period") shall be binding and shall constitute a firm order for the quantity of each Product specified therein (each, a "Firm Order"), (ii) each of months four (4) through six (6) of a given Forecast may not differ by more than twenty-five percent (25%) (whether positive or negative) from the quantity of such Product set forth in those months in the previous Forecast, and (iii) each of months seven (7) through twelve (12) of a given Forecast may not differ by more than fifty percent (50%) (whether positive or negative) from the quantity of such Product set forth in those months in the previous Forecast.

pursuant to a Purchase Order at least the amount of Product set forth in the Firm Order for such Product in the applicable calendar month. Manufacturer shall provide to Customer such quantities of Product as may be ordered by Customer pursuant to such Purchase Orders, up to one hundred ten percent (110%) of the quantity set forth in the most recent Forecast for the applicable period. In the event that Customer orders quantities of Product above one hundred ten percent (110%) of the quantity set forth in the most recent Forecast for the applicable period (such quantities above one hundred ten percent (110%) referred to as "Additional Quantities"), Manufacturer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts, but shall not be obligated, to supply such Additional Quantities. For purposes of this paragraph, the most recent Forecast for any given month shall mean the Forecast submitted by Customer in the month prior to the month in which the applicable Purchase Order is issued. All Purchase Orders shall specify the quantity and description of Products ordered, the applicable Facility where such Products will be Delivered, the required delivery date (subject to the provisions of Section 2.4(d)), and the manner of Delivery (including the carrier to be used). (d) Delivery Date. Unless expressly set forth to the contrary in a Facility Addendum, Customer will issue Purchase Orders for Product no later than a period equal to the Binding Forecast Period prior to the required delivery date. By way of example only, if the Binding Forecast Period is the first three (3) months of a Forecast with respect to a Product, then Customer will issue Purchase Order for such Product no later than three (3) months prior to the required delivery date. (e) No Minimum Purchase Obligation; Minimum Order Quantities. (i) No Obligation. Without limiting Customer's obligations under Section 2.1(e), 2.4(b), 2.4(c), 2.4(d) or 2.4(e)(ii), Manufacturer hereby acknowledges and agrees that Customer is not otherwise obligated to purchase any minimum or specific quantity, volume or dollar amount of Product under any Facility Addendum unless expressly set forth in the applicable Facility Addendum. (ii) Minimum Order Quantities. Notwithstanding Section 2.4(e)(i), Customer acknowledges and agrees that (A) each Purchase Order Customer places hereunder for Product that is either API or Bulk Drug Product shall be equal to, or a whole multiple of, the Batch Size for such applicable Product as set forth in the applicable Facility Addendum and (B) each Purchase Order that Customer places hereunder for Product that is Finished Product shall be equal to or greater than the Minimum Order Quantity for such applicable Product as set forth in the applicable Facility Addendum; provided that, where Customer places Purchase Orders under (B) above that exceed the applicable Minimum Order Quantity, Customer shall -17-

Source: UPJOHN INC, 10-12G, 1/21/2020





place such Purchase Orders for such excess quantities in Increments above the Minimum Order Quantity as specified in the applicable Facility Addendum. As used herein, "Batch Size" means the production quantity for a given run of a Product SKU and "Increments" means the quantity step change above the applicable Minimum Order Quantity, in each case, as specified in the applicable Facility Addendum. (f) Acceptance and Rejection of Orders. Within ten (10) Business Days of receipt of a Purchase Order, Manufacturer may reject such Purchase Order by written notice to Customer only on the basis that it is inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, including a Purchase Order containing (i) a delivery schedule that is inconsistent with Section 2.4(d), (ii) a Product quantity that is inconsistent with Section 2.4(e)(ii), (iii) a Product quantity that is less than the Firm Order for the applicable period or (iv) subject to Section 2.4(c), a Product quantity that is more than one hundred ten percent (110%) of the Forecast for the applicable period. Manufacturer shall be deemed to have accepted Customer's Purchase Order for Products in the event it either (a) indicates its acceptance of Customer's Purchase Order in writing or (b) does not indicate its rejection of a Purchase Order within ten (10) Business Days of receipt pursuant to this Section 2.4(f). (g) Changes to Purchase Orders. Purchase Orders, once submitted to Manufacturer, may be amended only by mutual written agreement of the Parties; provided that Manufacturer shall exercise its commercially reasonable efforts to comply with proposed amendments to Purchase Orders that Customer may request after sending a Purchase Order to Manufacturer. (h) Cancellations. In the event that Customer cancels all or part of a Purchase Order (provided that a cancellation shall be deemed to have occurred to the extent that Customer fails to issue a Purchase Order with respect to the full amount of Product contemplated by any portion of a Forecast with respect to the Binding Forecast Period) and such cancellation is not due to Manufacturer's breach of this Agreement or any Facility Addendum, Manufacturer will use good faith efforts to reallocate capacity and mitigate any resultant costs of such cancellation and, unless otherwise set forth with respect to the relevant cancelled Product under the applicable Facility Addendum, Customer will be charged for one hundred percent (100%) of any and all non-cancellable Third-Party costs actually and reasonably incurred by Manufacturer in accordance with this Agreement prior to cancellation for materials or services related to the cancelled portion of the Purchase Order for which reasonably acceptable documentation is submitted by Manufacturer to Customer. -18-

(a) Capacity Allocation. In the event that Manufacturer fails to manufacture and deliver Product in accordance with accepted Purchase Orders or applicable Specifications, Manufacturer shall notify Customer promptly, including details of the reasons for the failure and Manufacturer's estimated timeline of when the failure will be corrected. Manufacturer shall be solely responsible for undertaking commercially reasonable measures to minimize any shortage of Product delivered to Customer as a result of such manufacturing issues. If Manufacturer fails to manufacture and deliver Product in accordance with accepted Purchase Orders or applicable Specifications by the delivery date specified in the applicable Purchase Order(s) in accordance with Section 2.4(d), other than due to a Force Majeure Event, (i) for a period of two (2) or more months past such delivery date four (4) or more times in any rolling twelve (12) month period, or (ii) for a period of four (4) or more months past such delivery date on one occasion (each of (i) and (ii), a "Triggering Event"), then Manufacturer shall use its best efforts to allocate on a quarterly basis its manufacturing capacity and Product Materials to the manufacture and supply of Products for Customer on a ratable basis based on the use of each during the twelve (12)-month period immediately preceding such Triggering Event (or either (1) the Term of the applicable Facility Addendum, if the Term is less than twelve (12) months, or (2) such other period set forth in the applicable Facility Addendum); provided that (A) if Customer's Minimum Order Quantity for the applicable Product(s) exceeds its ratable allocation of manufacturing capacity or Product Materials (as applicable) for the applicable quarter, Customer shall continue to accrue its allocation of capacity until such quarter when Customer's allocation of capacity is equal to or greater than its accrued allocation of capacity and (B) this Section 2.5(a) shall not apply to the extent that Customer fails to timely provide adequate Customer-Supplied Materials or Buy-Sell Materials to Manufacturer in accordance with Section 12. For the avoidance of doubt, Manufacturer shall notify Customer promptly in writing of any anticipated Triggering Event when Manufacturer has reason to believe that such Triggering Event is likely to occur and provide such information with respect to such anticipated Triggering Event as Customer may reasonably request. -19-

(c) Modification of the Exclusive Purchase Requirement. Upon the expiration of the Exclusive Purchase Requirement Suspension Period, Customer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to resume ordering from Manufacturer, on a Product-by-Product basis, the subject Product(s) in accordance with Customer's Exclusive Purchase Requirement during the Exclusivity Period. (d) Business Continuity. Manufacturer shall maintain a written business continuity plan to be able to assure supply of Product to Customer in the event of a disruption to supply from the primary location or Facility of manufacture, including any disruption resulting from a Force Majeure Event and make such plan available from time to time upon Customer's request. (e) Remedies. Customer shall have the right to terminate this Agreement on an affected Product-by-affected Product basis immediately upon written notice to Manufacturer in the event a Triggering Event (under clause (ii) thereof) continues for more than one hundred and eighty (180) days.

able to supply Product to Customer in its requested quantities. Such assistance shall include providing, subject in all cases to Section 2.10(h), Technical Support in respect of the affected Product(s). In the event of a Triggering Event, Manufacturer shall be liable for any actual amounts that Customer is contractually required to pay to any Third-Party customer of Customer that result from Customer's inability to supply the affected Product to such Third-Party customer as a direct result of such Triggering Event; provided that (1) Customer shall provide to Manufacturer appropriate evidence of such amounts (including invoices from the applicable customers) and the applicable contractual requirements (redacted, in each case, of information pertaining to pricing and other commercial terms that are not directly related to the claimed amounts), it being understood and agreed that, upon request, Manufacturer will enter into customary confidentiality arrangements prior to such information being shared and (2) Manufacturer shall not be liable for any such amounts in the aggregate in any Fiscal Year in excess of the aggregate Conversion Cost Markup during such Fiscal Year with respect to all Products manufactured at the Facility that is the subject of the applicable Triggering Event.

Customer shall be entitled to review, upon reasonable prior written notice, all manufacturing Records relating to such samples, including all analytical procedures and cleaning validation relating to the equipment used in connection with the manufacture of the samples. Such Product samples shall be Delivered to Customer (or such Third Party as Customer shall designate) in accordance with the provisions set forth in Section 2.6(a) and at the Price as determined in accordance with the terms of Section 3. Customer shall pay for such samples when invoiced in accordance with Section 3.5. 2.9 Storage.

Manufacturer will store Products, Buy-Sell Materials, Product Materials, and Customer-Supplied Materials in accordance with the requirements of the Quality Agreement. With respect to those Third-Party warehouses used by Manufacturer or its Affiliates in the ordinary course for the storage of a given Product, Buy-Sell Materials, Product Materials, or Customer-Supplied Materials immediately prior to the Effective Date, Manufacturer may engage such Third-Party warehouse to perform the solely same activities for such Product, Buy- Sell Materials, Product Materials, and Customer-Supplied Materials under this Agreement without first obtaining Customer's prior written consent. The use of any Third Party warehouse for the storage of any Product, Buy-Sell Materials, Product Materials, or Customer- Supplied Materials other than in the manner expressly permitted pursuant to this Section 2.9 must be approved in advance in writing by Customer, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Manufacturer shall obtain the right for Customer to audit, at Customer's expense, any such Third-Party warehouse upon reasonable prior advance written notice and during normal business hours. Manufacturer has no obligation to store Product more than fifteen (15) Business Days following the requested delivery date for such Product; provided that (a) Manufacturer shall be obligated to store Product for such longer -23-

period as may be reasonably necessary for Customer to arrange transportation for such Product in the event that Manufacturer experiences delays in the manufacture, release, or supply of a particular Product that results in the delivery of a quantity of Product that exceeds historical or Forecast quantities of Product for the applicable period and; (b) with respect to any Product that Customer reasonably believes should not be released by Manufacturer, Manufacturer shall store such Product until the Parties' definitive resolution pursuant to this Agreement and the Quality Agreement as to whether such Product should be released. At the expiration of the applicable time frame in the preceding sentence, notwithstanding any provision of this Section 2.9 to the contrary, Manufacturer may transport and store the subject Product at a Third-Party warehouse at Customer's expense. 2.10 Transitional Support. (a) On a Product-by-Product basis, Customer may elect, upon written notice to Manufacturer, for Manufacturer to provide Customer with reasonable technical support, as more fully set forth in this Section 2.10, to transfer production of a given Product or Products to a Customer facility or a facility of an alternative source of supply as designated by Customer (such support, "Technical Support" and such facility, the "Receiving Site"). Customer may make such election for Technical Support at any time during the Term (including in the event of a Triggering Event under Section 2.5(a) or in advance of any expiration of this Agreement) or promptly after the termination or expiration of this Agreement but in no event more than ninety (90) days following the effective date of such termination or expiration. Such reasonable Technical Support shall consist of: (i) supply of a technical package to facilitate the transfer of all relevant manufacturing information for such Product(s) to the Receiving Site, including formulation descriptions, manufacturing instructions, Specifications, methods, data required for applicable regulatory submissions and facility qualification, and material supplier information, as applicable, except for any information that is subject to confidentiality obligations owing to a Third Party; provided that the technical package will not include any manufacturing information, including formulation descriptions, manufacturing instructions, Specifications, methods and material supplier information, that is generally available to or known by the public, can be obtained on reasonable terms from Third Parties or is already available or being utilized by Customer or its Affiliate at one of Customer's or its Affiliate's facilities; (ii) host site visits to the Manufacturer's Facility by Customer to observe production of the applicable Product or Products, in each case, at a mutually agreed date and subject to confidentiality procedures or requirements as may be requested or implemented by Manufacturer; provided that the request for each such visit shall be made so as to allow for sufficient advance preparation time and can be accommodated in the requested timeframe without interruption to Manufacturer's routine production or operations; -24-

(iii) performance of high-level consultation and answering reasonable queries for Customer through the transfer process; and (iv) provision of reasonable Product samples required under applicable Law for transfer activities. (b) Customer shall be responsible for identifying and requesting any and all Technical Support that is required from Manufacturer to assure such technology transfer is successful. (c) The Parties shall reasonably cooperate and mutually agree to facilitate the provision of any additional reasonable Technical Support with respect to the applicable Product or Products to Customer, including assistance through the transfer process, Manufacturer Personnel visits to the Receiving Site and training and troubleshooting during the Receiving Site's first production run of the applicable Product or Products, in each case, as and to the extent reasonably agreed by Manufacturer in each instance (and subject to Sections 2.10(d), 2.10(e) and 2.10(f)). (d) The Parties will work together in good faith to plan for upcoming and ongoing Technical Support needs and to accommodate such plans in order to maintain ongoing business continuity. In addition, Manufacturer shall have no obligation to hire or retain any individuals or make any capital expenditures in connection with Technical Support, and Manufacturer's obligation to provide Technical Support is contingent upon the continued employment by Manufacturer of those individuals capable of providing such Technical Support. Manufacturer may terminate its obligation to provide any Technical Support with respect to the applicable Product under this Agreement if Customer or any of its Affiliates hires any Manufacturer Personnel involved in providing Technical Support to Customer hereunder (without limiting any applicable non-solicitation obligations of Customer pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement). (e) Customer shall be solely responsible for any and all regulatory or other Governmental Authority requirements, activities and related costs and expenses that arise in conjunction with any Technical Support, technology transfer of production or production of each Product to or at the Receiving Site.

(f) Subject to Section 2.5(e), Customer is responsible for, and shall promptly reimburse Manufacturer for, any and all reasonable out-of- pocket costs and expenses incurred by or on behalf of Manufacturer in connection with any Technical Support provided to Customer under this Agreement, including employee costs to be charged at a rate that reasonably approximates the cost of providing the Technical Support, without any intent to cause Manufacturer to make profit or incur loss. (g) With respect to each Product for which Manufacturer provides Technical Support under this Agreement, Manufacturer shall provide to Customer any analytical materials and methods in Manufacturer's possession or control that are required in connection with disclosures to any applicable Governmental Authority to qualify the applicable Product Materials, Buy-Sell Materials, or Customer- Supplied Materials for such Product or such Product itself for release testing to meet the then-current applicable marketing authorization, in each case, subject to Section 13. (h) Nothing in this Agreement shall require Manufacturer to provide more than 75 hours per calendar year per Product in connection with any Technical Support. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, except as expressly provided in Section 2.10(g), Manufacturer shall have no obligation to disclose, license or otherwise provide confidential or proprietary information of Manufacturer, its Affiliates or any Third Party in connection with this Agreement or any Technical Support or technology transfer therein. 3. Price; Payment; Price Adjustments; Taxes. 3.1 Price. (a) Initial Price. On a Fiscal Year-by-Fiscal Year basis, Customer shall purchase each Product from Manufacturer at the Price for such Product for such Fiscal Year, as determined in accordance with the terms of this Section 3. The Price for each Product during the Initial Price Term (such Price, the "Initial Price" for such Product) is set forth in the Facility Addendum for such Product. Following the Initial Price Term, the Price of such Product may be adjusted only as set forth in Section 3.1(b) and Section 3.2. (b) Price in Extension Periods. In the event that Customer elects to extend the Initial Term of the Agreement or of a Facility Addendum, the Price for each applicable Product in any Extension Period shall be one hundred percent (100%) of Manufacturer's Standard Product Materials Cost plus one hundred and ten percent (110%) of Manufacturer's Standard Conversion Cost of such Product, each for the initial Fiscal Year of the first Extension Period with respect to such Product. During each Extension Period, the Price of such Product may be adjusted as set forth in Section 3.2; provided that the initial Fiscal Year of the first Extension Period shall operate as the Facility Conversion Cost Baseline Fiscal Year (as defined below). -26-

Source: UPJOHN INC, 10-12G, 1/21/2020





(c) Subject to the limitations and conditions set forth in this Agreement, it is the intention of the Parties that the Price of each Product reflects one hundred percent (100%) of Manufacturer's Standard Product Materials Cost plus one hundred and ten percent (110%) of Manufacturer's Standard Conversion Cost of such Product. The Price for each Product will be set forth in the currency specified in the applicable Facility Addendum. (d) Changes to the Standard Cost Methodology. Manufacturer shall have the right to change the Standard Cost methodology once per Fiscal Year; provided that any change shall be consistent with the Accounting Method and applied across all products manufactured at the applicable Facility. If Manufacturer elects to change the Standard Cost methodology, Manufacturer shall calculate both (i) the revised Standard Cost using the methodology effective during the then-current Fiscal Year of the Term of the applicable Facility Addendum and (ii) the percentage change in Standard Cost caused by the change in methodology relative to the former methodology. If such Standard Cost methodology change results in an increase of Facility Conversion Cost for Products manufactured for Customer of more than two percent (2%), then Manufacturer shall revert to the former methodology for purposes of the calculation of Price during such Fiscal Year. 3.2 Price Adjustment. (a) Product Materials Adjustment. (i) On a Facility-by-Facility basis, with respect to each full Fiscal Year of the Term of the applicable Facility Addendum, the Price of each Product manufactured at the applicable Facility will be updated to reflect one hundred percent (100%) of the full estimated amount of the increase or decrease in the cost of Product Materials for each such Product. (ii) In each Fiscal Year of the Term of this Agreement, Manufacturer shall submit a report to Customer by no later than the end of the first quarter of such Fiscal Year setting out the Facility Actual Product Materials Cost with respect to each Facility for the prior Fiscal Year. In the event that the Facility Actual Product Materials Cost differs from the Facility Estimated Product Materials Cost, when adjusted to reflect actual volume, then Manufacturer shall issue either (A) an invoice to Customer for any amounts owed by Customer to Manufacturer or (B) a credit memo for amounts owed by Manufacturer to Customer reflecting the difference between the Price as invoiced and an adjusted Price for such Fiscal Year; -27-

Source: UPJOHN INC, 10-12G, 1/21/2020





provided, however, that any such adjustment made in accordance with the foregoing shall be subject in all cases to the provisions of Section 3.2(e). Customer shall pay all undisputed amounts due in the currency specified in the applicable Facility Addendum within sixty (60) calendar days from the date of the invoice. If Customer disputes all or any portion of an invoice, it shall be required to pay only the amount not in dispute, and in such event Customer shall notify Manufacturer of the amount and nature of the dispute. Payment by Customer of any amount reflected in any invoice shall not result in a waiver of any of Customer's rights under this Agreement. (b) Conversion Cost Adjustments. (i) Subject to the remainder of this Section 3.2(b), on a Facility-by-Facility basis, if the Facility Conversion Costs of a Facility during any Fiscal Year following the first full Fiscal Year of the Term of the applicable Facility Addendum (such Fiscal Year, a "Facility Conversion Cost Adjustment Fiscal Year") are estimated to be (a) less than seventy-five percent (75%) of the Facility Conversion Costs for the Facility Conversion Cost Baseline Fiscal Year (as defined below) or (b) greater than one hundred and twenty-five percent (125%) of the Facility Conversion Costs for the Facility Conversion Cost Baseline Fiscal Year (clauses (a) and (b) referred to collectively as the "Facility Conversion Cost Threshold"), when adjusted to reflect a constant volume between the Facility Conversion Cost Adjustment Fiscal Year and the Facility Conversion Cost Baseline Fiscal Year, then the Price for such Product will be updated beginning with such Facility Conversion Cost Adjustment Fiscal Year to reflect one hundred and ten percent (110%) of the increase or decrease in Facility Conversion Costs. An example calculation of the foregoing Price adjustment is attached hereto as Attachment G. Subject to the last sentence of Section 3.1(b), the "Facility Conversion Cost Baseline Fiscal Year" shall be, as of the Effective Date, 2019 budget volumes and costs as summarized in the applicable Facility Addenda; provided that in each instance in which the Price is adjusted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence of this Section 3.2(b)(i), the Facility Conversion Cost Baseline Fiscal Year shall be the applicable Facility Conversion Cost Adjustment Fiscal Year. (ii) In the event that Price is adjusted as a result of a change to Facility Conversion Cost under Section 3.2(b)(i), the Facility Conversion Cost Threshold for all remaining Fiscal Years in the Initial Term (or Extension Periods as appropriate) will be reduced such that if Facility Conversion Costs of a Facility during any Facility Conversion Cost Adjustment Fiscal Year are estimated to be (a) less -28-

Source: UPJOHN INC, 10-12G, 1/21/2020





than eighty percent (80%) of the Facility Conversion Costs for the Facility Conversion Cost Baseline Fiscal Year or (b) greater than one hundred and twenty percent (120%) of the Facility Conversion Costs for the Facility Conversion Cost Baseline Fiscal Year, then the Price for such Product will be updated beginning with such Facility Conversion Cost Adjustment Fiscal Year to reflect the full estimated amount of the increase or decrease in Conversion Cost. (iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3.2(b), Manufacturer shall not have the ability to adjust the Price to reflect actual volume for Products in a Facility to the extent that Customer has reduced its demand for one or more Products in such Facility due to Manufacturer's breach of or other failure to supply under this Agreement or the applicable Facility Addendum. (iv) In each Fiscal Year following the first full Fiscal Year of the Term of this Agreement, Manufacturer shall submit a report to Customer by no later than the end of the first quarter of such Fiscal Year setting out the actual volume of Product for each Facility for the prior Fiscal Year. In the event that the actual Facility Conversion Costs demonstrate that the then applicable Facility Conversion Cost Threshold has been exceeded, and Manufacturer had not previously adjusted the applicable Price in accordance with this Section 3.2(b) to account for such adjustment, then Manufacturer shall either issue (A) an invoice to Customer for any amounts owed by Customer to Manufacturer or (B) a credit memo for amounts owed by Manufacturer to Customer reflecting the difference between the Price as invoiced and the adjusted Price for such Fiscal Year; provided, however, that any such adjustment made in accordance with the foregoing shall be subject in all cases to the provisions of Section 3.2(b)(iii). For clarity, any amount owed by Customer to Manufacturer or owed by Manufacturer to Customer shall be one hundred and ten percent (110%) of Manufacturer's Conversion Cost, reduced by a 20% allowance for variable costs. Customer shall pay all undisputed amounts due in the currency specified in the applicable Facility Addendum within sixty (60) calendar days from the date of the invoice. If Customer disputes all or any portion of an invoice, it shall be required to pay only the amount not in dispute, and in such event Customer shall notify Manufacturer of the amount and nature of the dispute. Payment by Customer of any amount reflected in any invoice shall not result in a waiver of any of Customer's rights under this Agreement. (c) Notwithstanding the above, the price for Buy-Sell Materials will be updated annually in each year following the first Fiscal Year to reflect one hundred percent (100%) of the full estimated amount of the cost of Buy-Sell Materials to Manufacturer. Customer may not change the price of Buy-Sell -29-

Source: UPJOHN INC, 10-12G, 1/21/2020





materials during any Fiscal Year. Upon any notification by Customer to Manufacturer of any reduction in the price of Buy-Sell Materials for the upcoming Fiscal Year, Manufacturer shall submit to Customer an inventory of such Buy-Sell Materials on hand and a calculation of the positive difference between the aggregate price for such Buy-Sell Materials applying the price for the current Fiscal Year and the aggregate price for such Buy-Sell Materials applying the price for the upcoming Fiscal Year. Customer shall promptly and in no event later than sixty (60) days issue to Manufacturer a credit memo in the amount of such positive difference reflected in Manufacturer's notice. (d) The increases or decreases described in this Section 3.2 shall be determined by Manufacturer in a manner consistent with the accounting methodologies used by Manufacturer as of the Effective Date and shall be based on the applicable Forecasts provided by Customer in July of the applicable Fiscal Year and applied consistently across Manufacturer's entire manufacturing operations for the full Facility. (e) Manufacturer shall notify Customer of any estimated expected changes to Prices for the upcoming Fiscal Year by no later than June 1 of the then-current Fiscal Year and shall notify Customer of any actual changes to Prices for the upcoming Fiscal Year by no later than October 30 of the then-current Fiscal Year. Between June 1 and October 30, the Parties will engage in ongoing discussions to ensure that any final changes to Prices for the applicable Fiscal Year conform to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Manufacturer will promptly respond to Customer's inquiries regarding any proposed changes to the Price of Products and provide reasonable documentation to Customer supporting the estimated or actual change in such Prices. Any actual, adjusted Price of each Product shall become effective on the first day of the first month of such upcoming Fiscal Year. (f) Any disputes relating to changes in Price for a given Product will be resolved pursuant to Section 3.4. 3.3 Cost Improvement.

At Customer's reasonable request, Manufacturer and Customer agree to discuss in good faith the implementation of possible cost reduction opportunities with the objective to reduce the net Price of Product. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Manufacturer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to reduce the price of Product Materials. -30-

3.4 Price Review and Audit Procedure. (a) Manufacturer shall maintain complete and accurate Records that fairly reflect the relevant costs and calculations used to determine the Price of each Product and shall retain such Records for a period of not less than three (3) years after the applicable Product was manufactured and delivered hereunder. With respect to a Price change under Section 3.2 for any Product in an upcoming Fiscal Year, if Customer requests such a review in writing within thirty (30) days following notice to Customer of such change, then: (i) the Parties shall reasonably discuss and attempt to resolve any disagreement with respect thereto and (ii) if such disagreement is not resolved within thirty (30) days following commencement of such discussions, Customer shall have the right, no more than one (1) time per Fiscal Year each for the subject of (1) and (2) below and on no less than thirty (30) days' notice to Manufacturer, to appoint a reputable and internationally recognized independent Third-Party audit firm reasonably acceptable to Manufacturer (and which agrees to be bound by Manufacturer's customary confidentiality agreement) to audit such relevant Records, during normal business hours and on a confidential basis, to verify that, either (1) the change in the relevant Products' Price for an applicable Facility for the upcoming Fiscal Year, as applicable, or (2) the true-up determination with respect to (x) the estimated and actual Facility Conversion Costs of a Facility with respect to any Fiscal Year or (y) the Facility Estimated Product Materials Cost and the Facility Actual Product Materials Cost with respect to any Fiscal Year, was accurately and equitably calculated by Manufacturer in accordance with this Agreement; provided that Customer shall be deemed to have waived its right for such a review if Customer does not make such request within thirty (30) days following delivery of Manufacturer's notice to Customer of such increase. For the avoidance of doubt, any such audit initiated by Customer in accordance with clause (ii) above shall include in the scope of audit all of the Products manufactured at the applicable Facility, and not be limited in scope to the discrete Product(s) in question. Subject to Section 3.4(b)(2), Customer shall bear all costs and expenses of conducting such an audit, and such accounting firm shall work on an hourly or flat fee basis without a contingency fee or other performance or bonus fee. Such accounting firm shall, as promptly as practicable, provide in writing (I) a detailed report of such audit to Manufacturer and (II) a separate report limited to the Price for the subject Products in the relevant Fiscal Year as calculated by such accounting firm in accordance with this Agreement to Manufacturer and Customer. The Price for the Products during a Fiscal Year, as calculated by such accounting firm, absent any manifest error, shall be binding upon the Parties with respect to such increase or required payment, as applicable; provided that, within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the audit report, Manufacturer shall have the right to dispute such Price or calculation thereof by submitting written notice to Customer and the accounting firm accompanied by information supporting Manufacturer's position. Within thirty (30) days of receipt of Manufacturer's notice of dispute, the accounting firm shall issue its final findings with respect to the Price for the relevant Product in the relevant Fiscal Year and such decision, absent manifest error, shall be binding upon the Parties. -31-

(b) If, as a result of any audit by Customer pursuant to Section 3.4(a), the aggregate Price calculated by the accounting firm with respect to all Products manufactured at the applicable Facility for a Fiscal Year is: (i) less than ninety-five percent (95%) of the aggregate Price for all such Products established by Manufacturer pursuant to Section 3.2 for such Products during such Fiscal Year, then, if Customer has made payments to Manufacturer for such Products at the higher Price established by Manufacturer during such Fiscal Year, Manufacturer shall refund to Customer the overpayment made by Customer; or (ii) more than one hundred and five percent (105%) of the aggregate Price for all such Products established by Manufacturer pursuant to Section 3.2 for such Products during such Fiscal Year, then, if Customer has made payments to Manufacturer for such Products at the lower Price established by Manufacturer for such period, Customer shall promptly pay Manufacturer for the amount of the underpayment that should have been paid by Customer;

in each case of clauses (i) and (ii), (1) such payment to be made within sixty (60) days of the owing Party's receipt of the relevant detailed report and final Price pursuant to Section 3.4(a) and (2) Manufacturer shall be responsible for payment of the applicable accounting firm's reasonable and actual fees in connection with such audit. 3.5 Invoices and Payment.

Manufacturer shall submit invoices to Customer upon Delivery of Product. All invoices for Products will be in functional currency unless otherwise specified in the applicable Facility Addendum, and all undisputed payments hereunder shall be in full and be made without any withholding, offset or any other deductions. Manufacturer shall include the following information on all invoices: (a) the applicable Purchase Order number and billing address; (b) the quantity of Product delivered (and where applicable, the type, description or part number, if any); (c) the required delivery date specified in the applicable Purchase Order; (d) the actual date of Delivery; (e) the Price; (f) any applicable Taxes, transportation charges or other charges provided for in the applicable Purchase Order; (g) the applicable invoice number; and (h) the Delivery Facility, unless otherwise specified in the Facility Addendum. Subject to Customer's rights under Section 4.8 to reject Non-Complying Product or Product that is not otherwise Delivered in accordance with the terms of and conditions of this Agreement, Manufacturer shall invoice Customer for Product upon Delivery of the applicable Product in accordance with Section 2.6(a). Customer shall be obligated to pay only for actual quantities of -32-

Product delivered. Unless otherwise set forth in the applicable Facility Addendum with respect to a particular Product or Products, Customer shall pay all undisputed amounts due in the currency specified in the applicable Facility Addendum within sixty (60) calendar days from the date of the invoice. If Customer disputes all or any portion of an invoice, it shall be required to pay only the amount not in dispute, and in such event Customer shall notify Manufacturer of the amount and nature of the dispute. Payment by Customer of any amount reflected in any invoice shall not result in a waiver of any of Customer's rights under this Agreement. If any payment required to be made under this Agreement is not made within twenty (20) days of the applicable date when such payment is due (the "Late Payment Date"), interest shall accrue on such past due amount from the Late Payment Date until the date payment is actually made at a quarterly rate equal to the lesser of (i) the Three-Month U.S. dollar LIBOR (Reuters Page LIBOR01) on the Late Payment Date (or the next Business Day if such Late Payment Date is not a Business Day), and (ii) the maximum rate permitted by applicable Law. Time for any payments hereunder shall be of the essence. 3.6 Taxes. (a) All sums payable under this Agreement are exclusive of any amount in respect of VAT. If any action of one Party (the "Supplier") under this Agreement constitutes, for VAT purposes, the making of a supply to another Party (or a member of that Party's Group) (the "Recipient") and VAT is or becomes chargeable on that supply, the Recipient shall pay to the Supplier, in addition to any amounts otherwise payable under this Agreement by the Recipient, a sum equal to the amount of the VAT chargeable on that supply against delivery to the Recipient of a valid VAT invoice issued in accordance with the laws and regulations of the applicable jurisdiction. (b) Without duplication of amounts covered by Section 3.6(a), Customer (or the applicable Affiliate) shall be responsible for all VAT, sales, goods and services, use, gross receipts, transfer, consumption and other similar Taxes (excluding, for clarity, Taxes imposed on net income, profits and gains and franchise Taxes), together with interest, penalties and additions thereto ("Service Taxes"), imposed by applicable taxing authorities on the direct sale of Products to Customer or any of its Affiliates or any payment hereunder; provided that such Service Taxes are shown on a valid invoice. If Manufacturer or any of its Affiliates is required to pay any part of such Service Taxes, Manufacturer shall provide Customer with evidence that such Service Taxes have been paid, and Customer (or its applicable Affiliate) shall reimburse Manufacturer for such Service Taxes. Manufacturer shall, upon the reasonable request of Customer, promptly revise any invoice to the extent such invoice was erroneously itemized or categorized. Each Party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) minimize the amount of any Service Taxes imposed on the provision of Services hereunder, including by availing itself of any available exemptions from or reductions to any such -33-

Source: UPJOHN INC, 10-12G, 1/21/2020





Service Taxes, and (ii) cooperate with the other Party in providing any information or documentation that may be reasonably necessary to minimize such Service Taxes or obtain such exemptions or reductions. If at any time Manufacturer (or any of its Affiliates) receives a refund (or credit or offset in lieu of a refund) of any Service Taxes borne by Customer (or any of its Affiliates), then Manufacturer or its Affiliate receiving such refund or utilizing such credit or offset shall promptly pay over the amount of such refund, credit or offset (net of all reasonable related out-of-pocket costs, expenses and Taxes incurred in respect thereof) to Customer or its applicable Affiliate, it being understood that Customer and its applicable Affiliate shall be liable for (x) any subsequent disallowance of such refund, credit or offset and any related interest, penalties or additions thereto and (y) any reasonable out-of- pocket costs and expenses related to such disallowance. (c) The Parties and their Affiliates shall reasonably cooperate to determine whether any Tax withholding applies to any amounts paid under this Agreement and, if so, shall further reasonably cooperate in (i) minimizing the amount of any such withholding Taxes, including by availing itself of any available exemptions from or reductions to any such withholding Taxes, (ii) providing any information or documentation that may be reasonably necessary to minimize such withholding Taxes or obtain such exemptions (including, without limitation, pursuant to any applicable double taxation or similar treaty) or (iii) receiving a refund of such withholding Taxes or claiming a Tax credit therefor. If any such withholding is required by applicable Law, the paying Party (or its applicable Affiliate) shall properly and timely withhold and remit such Taxes to the applicable taxing authority and use reasonable efforts to provide the other Party with a copy of any receipt (where it is common practice for the applicable taxing authority to provide such a receipt) or other documentation confirming such payment, and such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the receiving Party (or its applicable Affiliate). The paying Party (or its applicable Affiliate) shall not be required to "gross up" any amounts invoiced to the paying Party to account for, or otherwise compensate the receiving Party (or its applicable Affiliate) for, any Taxes that are required to be withheld under applicable Law. (d) Where a Party or any member of its Group is required by this Agreement to reimburse or indemnify the other Party or any member of its Group for any cost or expense, the reimbursing or indemnifying Party (or the applicable member of its Group) shall reimburse or indemnify the other Party (or the applicable member of its Group) for the full amount of the cost or expense, inclusive of any amounts in respect of VAT imposed on that amount to the extent properly reflected on a valid invoice, except to the extent that the reimbursed or indemnified Party reasonably determines that it (or such member of its Group), or a member of the same group as it (or such member of its Group) for VAT purposes, is entitled to credit for or repayment of that VAT from any relevant taxing authority. -34-

(e) For purposes of this Agreement, and except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, Tax matters shall be exclusively governed by the Tax Matters Agreement, and in the event of any inconsistency between the Tax Matters Agreement and this Agreement with respect to Tax matters, the Tax Matters Agreement shall control. 3.7 No Duplicative Payments. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no Party (or Affiliate thereof) shall enjoy a duplicative right, entitlement, obligation, or recovery with respect to any matter arising out of the same facts and circumstances. 4. Manufacturing Standards and Quality Assurance. 4.1 Quality Agreement.

On a Facility-by-Facility and Product-by-Product basis, the Parties will comply with the requirements and provisions set forth in the Quality Agreement applicable to the applicable Facility and Product, the form of which has been attached hereto as Attachment B and, through such attachment, made a part hereof. In the event of a conflict between the terms of the applicable Quality Agreement and the terms of this Agreement, the terms of the Quality Agreement shall govern and control for all quality and regulatory compliance matters and the terms of this Agreement shall govern and control for all other matters. 4.2 Manufacturing Standards.

Manufacturer shall manufacture and supply each Product (including disposing of all Waste and other materials) in accordance with all applicable Specifications, applicable Laws, requirements under the applicable Quality Agreement, and this Agreement. 4.3 Manufacturing Changes. (a) Discretionary Changes. Subject to Section 4.3(b), in the event that either Party desires to change, revise, modify or otherwise alter the Specifications, manufacturing processes, Product Materials, Buy-Sell Materials, Customer-Supplied Materials, or Facilities with respect to a given Product in any manner (each, a "Manufacturing Change"), the Party desiring the Manufacturing Change shall notify the other Party in writing of the proposed Manufacturing Change and the Parties will promptly meet to discuss, in good faith, the feasibility of implementing such Manufacturing Change and the allocation of costs between the Parties for such Manufacturing Change; provided that the requested Manufacturing Change will not be implemented unless and until the Parties mutually agree in writing to implement such Manufacturing Change. Unless otherwise agreed upon by the Parties, the Party requesting the Manufacturing Change will be responsible for, and will bear the costs of, any filings or other actions that either Party must take with the applicable Governmental Authority as a result of such Manufacturing Change. -35-

(b) Required Changes. If, at any time, a Manufacturing Change is required by a Governmental Authority in a country in which Regulatory Approval for a given Product has been granted, a Governmental Authority in a country in which Customer seeks to obtain Regulatory Approval for a given Product, or a Governmental Authority in the country in which the Facility that manufactures a given Product is located, then the Party that first has knowledge of the required Manufacturing Change shall notify the other Party in writing of such required Manufacturing Change, and Manufacturer will review such Manufacturing Change with Customer. Manufacturer will bear all costs and expenses associated with implementing the Manufacturing Change, unless such Manufacturing Change relates solely to a Product or Products manufactured for Customer (including any required labeling changes), in which case Customer will bear all costs and expenses associated with implementing such Manufacturing Change for such Product, including any changes to labeling or packaging, but only to the extent such costs are reasonable and documented. 4.4 Pest Control.

Manufacturer shall manufacture all Products, and Manufacturer shall store all Product Materials, Buy-Sell Materials, Customer-Supplied Materials, and all Products, in a clean, dry area, free from insects and rodents, in a manner to prevent entry of foreign materials and contamination of Product. Manufacturer's pest control measures shall include the adequate cleaning of the Facility, control of food and drink, protection of Product from the environment, monitoring of flying and crawling pests and logs detailing findings and actions taken. Manufacturer's pest control program shall be detailed in a written procedure which complies with applicable Laws, including cGMPs, and which shall be subject to review and approval by Customer. If Customer has specific concerns about procedures in place at any Facility, Customer will present such issues in its audit findings and the Parties will discuss in good faith a mutually agreeable plan for resolution of such issues. Failure of Manufacturer to comply with this Section 4.4 shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement. 4.5 Legal and Regulatory Filings and Requests. (a) Manufacturer shall reasonably cooperate with Customer in responding to all requests for information from, and in making all legally required filings with, Governmental Authorities in the Territory having jurisdiction to make such requests or require such filings. Manufacturer shall: (a) obtain and comply with all licenses, consents and permits required under applicable Laws in the Territory (and Manufacturer shall provide Customer with a -36-

Source: UPJOHN INC, 10-12G, 1/21/2020





copy of all such licenses, consents and permits that are material upon Customer's reasonable request); and (b) comply with all applicable Laws in the Territory with respect to its manufacturing and packaging processes, the Facility or otherwise, to permit the performance of its obligations hereunder. Upon Customer's request, Manufacturer shall apply for and obtain Certificates of Pharmaceutical Production ("CPP") from the Governmental Authorities of the country where the Facility is located, such CPPs to be issued to countries where CPPs according to Customer's opinion are required. Manufacturer shall pay all reasonable costs necessary to obtain such CPPs and be entitled to be reimbursed against invoice by Customer at cost; provided that Manufacturer shall make good faith efforts to consolidate its invoices for such reimbursement for CPPs and submit to Customer on a Fiscal Year quarterly basis. (b) In the event that Customer wishes to extend the Territory with respect to a certain Product, Customer shall notify Manufacturer of such request and Manufacturer shall consider Customer's request in good faith. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that the Parties agree to extend the Territory with respect to a certain Product, any resulting Manufacturing Change shall be treated as a discretionary Manufacturing Change and governed by Section 4.3(a). 4.6 Quality Tests and Checks.

Manufacturer shall perform all bulk holding stability, manufacturing trials, validation (including, but not limited to, method, process and equipment cleaning validation), raw material, in-process, bulk finished product and stability (chemical and/or microbial) tests or checks required to assure the quality of a given Product and any tests or checks required by the Specifications, the Quality Agreement, applicable Facility Addendum or applicable Laws. With respect to any Product manufactured prior to Closing or located at a Facility as of Closing, Manufacturer shall maintain, continue and complete any and all such activities, tests and checks, including, without limitation, all ongoing stability testing. All costs associated with the performance of Manufacturer's obligations under this Section 4.6 (including with respect to any Product manufactured prior to Closing or located at a Facility as of Closing) are included in the Price of each Product and, accordingly, Manufacturer shall perform the foregoing at its cost and expense, without further reimbursement from Customer. Manufacturer shall obtain Product for these tests from batches of Product manufactured under this Agreement, and Manufacturer is responsible for providing all necessary technical, quality and operational resources.

4.7 Responsibility for Non-Complying Product.

Manufacturer shall not release any Product for Delivery to Customer that does not conform to the covenants set forth in Section 5.2(e) (such non-conforming Product, "Non-Complying Product"), without the prior written approval of Customer. Manufacturer shall quarantine all such Non-Complying Products and shall promptly submit to Customer a report detailing the nature of such non-compliance and Manufacturer's recommended disposition, including the investigation and testing done. Manufacturer shall also provide any additional information regarding such Non-Complying Product as may reasonably be requested by Customer. Customer shall not be required to pay for any Non-Complying Product or for the destruction or other disposition thereof (unless an investigation determines that the root cause for such Product being Non-Complying Product is Non-Complying Buy-Sell Materials or Non-Complying Customer-Supplied Material). 4.8 Rejection of Non-Complying Product. (a) Customer's Ability to Reject. Customer may reject any Non-Complying Product or Product that is not delivered to Customer in accordance with this Agreement by providing written notice of such rejection to Manufacturer within seventy-five (75) days following Customer's receipt of any Delivery of Product hereunder; provided, however, that Customer may, until the expiry date for a Product, provide notice of rejection of any Delivery of such Product having (i) latent defects, (ii) any defects that are not reasonably discoverable by Customer through standard inspection and testing of Products or (iii) defects caused by the breach by Manufacturer of any of its representations or warranties under this Agreement (collectively, "Latent Defects"); provided, further, that, and notwithstanding the foregoing, Customer shall notify Manufacturer within sixty (60) days after Customer first becomes aware of any such Latent Defect. (b) Manufacturer's Ability to Reject. Manufacturer may reject any Non-Complying Product by (i) providing Customer with no less than sixty (60) days' prior written notice of Manufacturer's intention to reject such Non-Complying Product along with the documentation set forth in Section 4.7, (ii) meeting with Customer at Customer's request to discuss the basis for the proposed rejection of the subject Non-Complying Product, and (iii) providing Customer with notice of rejection in the event that Manufacturer rejects the subject Non- Complying Product at the end of such sixty (60) day period (or such other time frame as the parties may agree upon). (c) Manufacturer's Obligation; Replacement. Manufacturer shall respond to any rejection, defect notice or any quality-related complaint from Customer pursuant to Section 4.8(a) in a timely manner or such other time frame as may be specified in the applicable Quality Agreement. Manufacturer shall conduct an analysis of the causes of any such complaint, shall report to Customer on any corrective action taken and shall reasonably consider -38-

Source: UPJOHN INC, 10-12G, 1/21/2020





Customer's suggestions related to such corrective action or other quality-related matters. Customer shall promptly return any Product (or portions thereof) rejected pursuant to Section 4.8(a) to Manufacturer at Manufacturer's expense. With respect to any Non- Complying Product rejected by Customer, in addition to any other rights or remedies of Customer hereunder, Customer may elect, in its sole discretion, upon written notice to Manufacturer to either (i) have Manufacturer replace any Non-Complying Product as soon as practicable at no additional charge to Customer; provided that (A) the Manufacturer shall replace such Non-Complying Product within a period of ninety (90) days beginning on the date that the Manufacturer confirms or a Third-Party laboratory determines that the subject Product is a Non-Complying Product, and (B) if Manufacturer fails to replace such Non-Complying Product within such ninety (90) day period, then a Triggering Event shall be deemed to have occurred and the provisions of Section 2.5 shall apply; or (ii) be reimbursed for the Price of the Non-Complying Product actually paid. Manufacturer shall reimburse Customer for the cost of all Customer-Supplied Materials used to manufacture any Non-Complying Product (unless such Product is a Non-Complying Product due to any Non-Complying Customer-Supplied Material, as applicable). (d) Independent Testing. If the Parties are unable to agree on whether Product rejected by Customer is Non-Complying Product, then Manufacturer may hire an independent Third-Party laboratory, subject to Customer's prior written approval of such laboratory, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, to perform testing on such rejected Product in accordance with the Specifications, applicable Laws and the Quality Agreement, which Third Party laboratory shall promptly provide the results thereof to Customer and Manufacturer. Manufacturer must engage such Third-Party laboratory within the thirty (30) day period following Manufacturer's receipt of Customer's rejection notice. If Manufacturer fails to engage such Third-Party laboratory during such thirty (30) day period, then Manufacturer will be deemed to have waived its right to engage such Third-Party laboratory. The determination of such tests shall be binding upon the Parties for all purposes hereunder; provided that, if such tests are unable to determine whether or not such rejected Product is Non-Complying Product, or if Manufacturer does not engage such Third-Party laboratory within the thirty (30) day period, then such Product shall be deemed to be Non-Complying Product. If such tests determine that the rejected Product is, or such Product is so deemed to be, Non-Complying Product, then Manufacturer shall bear the costs of such tests and Customer's remedies with respect to Non-Complying Product as set forth in this Agreement shall apply to such Non-Complying Product. Otherwise, Customer shall (i) bear the costs of such tests and shall remain obligated to pay Manufacturer the Price for such Product in accordance with Section 3 and (ii) reimburse Manufacturer for any shipping charges paid by Manufacturer pursuant to Section 4.8(c) with respect to the return of such -39-

Product to Manufacturer. Without limiting the foregoing obligations, if Customer reasonably requests in writing, then Manufacturer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to re-deliver such Product to Customer at Customer's expense. For the avoidance of doubt, provided that the Product conforms to the minimum shelf-life dating set forth in Section 5.2(e)(v) upon initial Delivery, such minimum shelf-life dating requirement shall not apply to the subject Product upon re-delivery in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence. (e) Survival. The provisions of this Section 4.8 shall survive termination or expiration of this Agreement or the applicable Facility Addendum. 4.9 Disposal of Rejected and Non-Complying Product.

All Non-Complying Product and Product rejected pursuant to this Agreement shall be removed (if applicable) and disposed of by Manufacturer in accordance with all applicable Laws, and as approved in advance by Customer in writing (such disposal cost to be at Manufacturer's expense, unless it is subsequently determined that Customer wrongly rejected such Product pursuant to Section 4.8). Manufacturer shall make documentation relating to such disposition available to Customer upon Customer's reasonable request. Manufacturer shall not sell for salvage or for any other purpose any rejected or Non-Complying Product, without the prior written approval of Customer. Manufacturer shall destroy all Non-Complying Product prior to disposal and Manufacturer shall deface and render unreadable all words or symbols that identify Customer, including Customer's trademarks and logotypes that adorn any packaging containing such Product, prior to disposal of such Product. 4.10 Maintenance and Retention of Records.

Manufacturer shall maintain detailed Records with respect to Product Materials, Buy-Sell Materials, and Customer-Supplied Materials usage and finished Product production in accordance with the Quality Agreement. 4.11 Government Inspections, Seizures and Recalls. (a) Notification; Initiation of Recalls. If (i) Manufacturer determines or comes to learn that a Product distributed to the market contains a latent defect or (ii) the FDA or any other Governmental Authority conducts an inspection at Manufacturer's Facility, seizes any Product, Buy-Sell Materials, Customer-Supplied Materials, or Product Materials, requests a Recall of any Product, Buy-Sell Materials, Customer-Supplied Materials, or Product Materials, or otherwise notifies Manufacturer of any violation or potential violation of any applicable Law at the Facility, or (iii) Customer notifies Manufacturer of its intent to initiate a Recall, then, with respect to each ((i)- (iii)), Manufacturer shall promptly notify Customer (as applicable) and shall take such actions as may be required under the Specifications or Quality -40-

Agreement. As applicable, Manufacturer shall promptly send any reports relating to such inspections, Recalls, violations or potential violations of applicable Law to Customer; provided that Manufacturer may reasonably redact any such reports to protect its confidential and proprietary Information that does not relate to Products. In the event that any such Governmental Authority requests, but does not seize, a given Product in connection with any such inspection, Manufacturer shall, to the extent reasonably practicable and permitted by applicable Law (1) promptly notify Customer of such request, (2) satisfy such request only after receiving Customer's approval, (3) follow any reasonable procedures instructed by Customer in responding to such request and (4) promptly send any samples of the applicable Product requested by the Governmental Authority to Customer. Manufacturer shall give and permit full and unrestricted access to all or any of its premises at any time to any authorized representative of any Governmental Authority or any of its agents or advisers and shall cooperate fully with any such representatives, in each case, relating to any such inspection. Manufacturer shall not initiate any Recall of Product, except as provided in the Quality Agreement, without the prior written agreement by Customer. (b) Costs. In the event a Recall results from any breach by Manufacturer of this Agreement, including Recalls on account of a given Product containing a latent defect, in addition to any other rights or remedies available to Customer under this Agreement, Manufacturer shall reimburse Customer for Customer's costs and expenses associated with such Recall, including costs of materials supplied by Customer (including Customer-Supplied Materials), shipping costs, administrative costs associated with arranging and coordinating the Recall and all actual Third Party costs associated with the distribution of replacement Product; provided that Customer shall be solely responsible for all, and shall reimburse Manufacturer for Manufacturer's costs and expenses associated with any Recall to the extent such Recall does not result from a breach by Manufacturer of this Agreement (e.g., is due to any Non- Complying Customer-Supplied Material or Non-Complying Buy-Sell Material). 4.12 Inspections.

Subject to the remainder of this Section 4.12, no more than once per calendar year, upon thirty (30) days' advance written notice to Manufacturer, Customer may physically inspect or audit (consistent with Section 15.2) the Facilities under this Section 4.12; provided that Customer will use good faith efforts to choose dates of inspection or audit that do not unreasonably interfere with the operation of Manufacturer's business; provided, further, that Customer shall consider in good faith any alternative dates of inspection or audit proposed by Manufacturer within five (5) days of Manufacturer's receipt of such notice (it being understood that nothing in this Section 4.12 shall require Customer to accept any such proposed alternative dates of inspection or audit). Notwithstanding the limits set forth in the -41-

Source: UPJOHN INC, 10-12G, 1/21/2020





foregoing sentence, Customer may more frequently conduct "for cause" physical inspections or audits of a Facility with five (5) days' advance written notice to Manufacturer if Customer has reasonable cause to believe that an inspection or audit of such Facility is warranted because Manufacturer's activities with respect to such Facility are in breach of this Agreement, applicable Laws, the Quality Agreement or the applicable Facility Addendum. Any such inspection or audit shall include access to relevant Records (subject to the terms of Section 15.2) and Personnel and being present during, as applicable, start-up manufacturing operations, validation, cleaning, sampling, laboratory testing, warehouse receiving and storage, pack out and shipping. Manufacturer shall provide technical assistance and direction to Customer and its representatives at the Facility. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, Customer may conduct, at its own expense, periodic quality audits, to ensure Manufacturer's compliance with the terms of this Agreement. Manufacturer shall cooperate with Customer's representatives for all of these purposes, and shall promptly correct any deficiencies noted during the audits. Any Records or information accessed or otherwise obtained by Customer or its representatives during any such inspection or audit or any visit at any Facility shall be deemed Manufacturer's confidential and proprietary Information and each representative of Customer will be subject to non-use and other confidentiality obligations substantially comparable to those set forth herein for Customer. 4.13 Segregation of Restricted Compounds.

Unless otherwise set forth in a Facility Addendum with respect to a Product, Manufacturer shall not manufacture a Product using facilities or equipment shared with the following classes of product without prior consultation and agreement with Customer: (a) steroids, hormones, or otherwise highly active or toxic products that carry a likelihood of a serious adverse effect (e.g., carcinogenicity; anaphylaxis; reproductive and/or developmental toxicity; serious target organ toxicity) following a potential product cross-contamination or carry-over scenario, particularly at low exposure concentrations (i.e., with reference to an acceptable daily exposure (ADE) value or permitted daily exposure (PDE) value < 10 µg/day); (b) immunosuppressors where the ADE or PDE value < 10 µg/day; (c) live or infectious biological agents; (d) live or attenuated vaccines; (e) biotherapeutics where the ADE or PDE value < 10 µg/day and sufficient deactivation cannot be demonstrated; (f) products exclusive for animal use; (g) non-medicinal products; or (h) radiopharmaceuticals.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Customer shall not be liable for Losses described in Section 10.2(a) to the extent such Losses are: (i) caused by the gross negligence, fraud or willful misconduct of a Manufacturer Indemnified Party in connection with the performance or non-performance of this Agreement; (ii) caused by the breach of any of the terms of this Agreement or any Facility Addendum by a Manufacturer Indemnified Party or (iii) are subject to Manufacturer's indemnification obligation pursuant to Section 10.1. Furthermore, Customer shall not be liable for Losses pursuant to Section 10.2(a)(iii) above to the extent such infringement or misappropriation is caused by Manufacturer's unauthorized use or unauthorized modification of any Customer Property, Customer- Owned Improvements and Developments, Buy-Sell Materials or Customer-Supplied Materials. 10.3 Indemnification Procedures. (a) If, at or following the date of this Agreement, any Person entitled to be indemnified under this Section 10 (the "Indemnitee") shall receive notice or otherwise learn of the assertion by a Person (including any Governmental Authority) who is not a member of the Pluto Group or the Spinco Group of any claim or of the commencement by any such Person of any Action with respect to which the Party from whom indemnification may be sought under this Section 10 (the "Indemnifying Party") (such claim, a "Third-Party Claim"), such Indemnitee shall give such Indemnifying Party written notice thereof as promptly as practicable, but in any event within thirty (30) days (or sooner if the nature of the Third-Party Claim so requires) after becoming aware of such Third-Party Claim. Any such notice shall describe the Third-Party Claim in reasonable detail, including the facts and circumstances giving rise to such claim for indemnification, and include copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnitee relating to the Third-Party Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the failure of any Indemnitee to provide notice as provided in this Section 10.3(a) shall not relieve an Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this Section 10, except to the extent, and only to the extent, that such Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such failure to give notice in accordance with this Section 10.3(a). (b) An Indemnifying Party may elect (but shall not be required) to defend (and seek to settle or compromise), at such Indemnifying Party's own expense and by such Indemnifying Party's own counsel (which counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee), any Third-Party Claim; provided that the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to defend such Third-Party Claim and shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of one separate -60-

Source: UPJOHN INC, 10-12G, 1/21/2020





counsel for all Indemnitees if the claim for indemnification relates to or arises in connection with any criminal action, indictment or allegation or if such Third-Party Claim seeks an injunction or equitable relief against the Indemnitee (and not any Indemnifying Party or any of its Affiliates). Within thirty (30) days after the receipt of notice from an Indemnitee in accordance with Section 10.3(a) (or sooner, if the nature of such Third-Party Claim so requires), the Indemnifying Party shall notify the Indemnitee of its election whether the Indemnifying Party will assume responsibility for defending such Third-Party Claim, which election shall specify any reservations or exceptions to its defense. After notice from an Indemnifying Party to an Indemnitee of its election to assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim, such Indemnitee shall have the right to employ separate counsel and to participate in (but not control) the defense, compromise, or settlement thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be the expense of such Indemnitee; provided, however, in the event that the Indemnifying Party has elected to assume the defense of the Third-Party Claim but has specified, and continues to assert, any reservations or exceptions in such notice, then, in such case, the reasonable fees and expenses of one separate counsel for all Indemnitees shall be borne by the Indemnifying Party; and provided further that the Indemnifying Party will pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel if, based on the reasonable opinion of legal counsel to the Indemnitee, a conflict or potential conflict of interest exists between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnitee which makes representation of both parties inappropriate under applicable standards of professional conduct. (c) If an Indemnifying Party elects not to assume responsibility for defending a Third-Party Claim, or fails to notify an Indemnitee of its election as provided in Section 10.3(b), then the applicable Indemnitee may defend such Third-Party Claim at the cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party to the extent indemnification is available under the terms of this Agreement. If an Indemnifying Party elects not to assume responsibility for defending a Third-Party Claim, or fails to notify an Indemnitee of its election as provided in Section 10.3(b), then, it shall not be a defense to any obligation of the Indemnifying Party to pay any amount in respect of such Third-Party Claim that the Indemnifying Party was not consulted in the defense thereof, that such Indemnifying Party's views or opinions as to the conduct of such defense were not accepted or adopted, that such Indemnifying Party does not approve of the quality or manner of the defense thereof or, subject to Section 10.3(d), that such Third-Party Claim was incurred by reason of a settlement rather than by a judgment or other determination of liability. (d) Neither Party may settle or compromise any Third-Party Claim for which either Party is seeking to be indemnified hereunder without the prior written consent of the other Party, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, unless such settlement or compromise is solely for monetary damages that are fully payable by the settling or compromising party, does not involve any admission, finding or determination of wrongdoing or violation of Law by the other Party and provides for a full, unconditional and irrevocable release of the other Party from all Liability in connection with the Third-Party Claim. -61-

10.4 Limitations on Liability. (a) Except in the event of (i) Third Party Claims subject to a Party's indemnification obligations pursuant to Section 10.1, (ii) Third Party Claims subject to a Party's indemnification obligations pursuant to Section 10.2, (iii) the gross negligence, fraud or willful misconduct of a Party or its Personnel, (iv) a Party's willful breach of this Agreement, (v) a breach of Section 13 or (vi) customer liabilities pursuant to, and subject to the limitations set forth in, Section 2.5(e), neither Party's aggregate liability to the other Party (or its Personnel that are indemnitees under Section 10.1 or Section 10.2, as applicable) under this Agreement for the initial twelve (12) month period immediately following the Effective Date, and for any twelve (12) month period thereafter during the Term, shall exceed, on a cumulative basis, the amount that is one and one half (11∕2) times the aggregate amounts paid or payable pursuant to this Agreement in the preceding twelve (12) month period preceding the loss date by Customer to Manufacturer but solely with respect to the supply hereunder of Product (or Products) for which such corresponding liability arose (the "Affected Products") and not any other Products (or if, as of the time the liability arises, this Agreement has not been in effect for twelve (12) months, then the amounts paid or payable by Customer to Manufacturer hereunder during the period from the Effective Date until such time the liability arises, shall be annualized to a full twelve (12) months but solely with respect to the supply hereunder of the Affected Product(s) and not any other Products). (b) NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT TO THE CONTRARY, EXCEPT FOR DAMAGES OR CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF (I) A BREACH OF SECTION 13 OF THIS AGREEMENT, (II) CUSTOMER LIABILITIES PURSUANT TO, AND SUBJECT TO THE LIMITATIONS SET FORTH IN, SECTION 2.5(E), (III) A PARTY'S OR ITS PERSONNEL'S GROSS NEGLIGENCE, FRAUD OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT, (IV) A PARTY'S WILLFUL BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT, OR (V) A PARTY'S INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATION WITH RESPECT TO THIRD PARTY CLAIMS UNDER SECTION 10.1 OR SECTION 10.2, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY OR ANY INDEMNIFIED PARTY HEREUNDER FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SPECIAL DAMAGES, INCIDENTAL OR INDIRECT DAMAGES, LOSS OF REVENUE OR PROFITS, DIMINUTION IN VALUE, DAMAGES BASED ON MULTIPLE OF REVENUE OR EARNINGS OR OTHER PERFORMANCE METRIC, LOSS OF BUSINESS REPUTATION, PUNITIVE AND EXEMPLARY DAMAGES OR ANY SIMILAR DAMAGES ARISING OR RESULTING FROM OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER SUCH ACTION IS BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIABILITY) OR OTHERWISE. -62-

10.5 Indemnification Obligations Net of Insurance Proceeds and Other Amounts. (a) The Parties intend that any Loss subject to indemnification or reimbursement pursuant to this Section 10 will be net of Insurance Proceeds or other amounts actually recovered (net of any out-of-pocket costs or expenses incurred in the collection thereof) from any Person by or on behalf of the Indemnitee in respect of any indemnifiable Liability. Accordingly, the amount that any Indemnifying Party is required to pay to any Indemnitee will be reduced by any Insurance Proceeds or other amounts actually recovered (net of any out-of-pocket costs or expenses incurred in the collection thereof) from any Person by or on behalf of such Indemnitee in respect of the related Loss. If an Indemnitee receives a payment (an "Indemnity Payment") required by this Agreement from an Indemnifying Party in respect of any Loss and subsequently receives Insurance Proceeds or any other amounts in respect of the related Loss, then the Indemnitee will pay to the Indemnifying Party an amount equal to the excess of the Indemnity Payment received over the amount of the Indemnity Payment that would have been due if the Insurance Proceeds or such other amounts (net of any out-of-pocket costs or expenses incurred in the collection thereof) had been received, realized or recovered before the Indemnity Payment was made. (b) An insurer that would otherwise be obligated to pay any claim shall not be relieved of the responsibility with respect thereto or, solely by virtue of any provisions contained in this Agreement, have any subrogation rights with respect thereto, it being expressly understood and agreed that no insurer or any other Third Party shall be entitled to a "wind-fall" (i.e., a benefit that such insurer or other Third Party would not be entitled to receive in the absence of the indemnification provisions) by virtue of the indemnification provisions hereof. Each Party shall, and shall cause the members of its Group to, use commercially reasonable efforts (taking into account the probability of success on the merits and the cost of expending such efforts, including attorneys' fees and expenses) to collect or recover any Insurance Proceeds that may be collectible or recoverable respecting the Liabilities for which indemnification may be available under this Section 10. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Indemnifying Party may not delay making any indemnification payment required under the terms of this Agreement, or otherwise satisfying any indemnification obligation, pending the outcome of any Action to collect or recover Insurance Proceeds, and an Indemnitee need not attempt to collect any Insurance Proceeds prior to making a claim for indemnification or receiving any Indemnity Payment otherwise owed to it under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement. -63-

10.6 Additional Matters. (a) Indemnification payments in respect of any Liabilities for which an Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under this Section 10 shall be paid reasonably promptly (but in any event within sixty (60) days of the final determination of the amount that the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under this Section 10) by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnitee as such Liabilities are incurred upon demand by the Indemnitee, including reasonably satisfactory documentation setting forth the basis for the amount of such indemnification payment, documentation with respect to calculations made and consideration of any Insurance Proceeds that actually reduce the amount of such Liabilities. (b) If (i) a Party incurs any Liability arising out of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement; (ii) an adequate legal or equitable remedy is not available for any reason against the other Party to satisfy the Liability incurred by the incurring Party; and (iii) a legal or equitable remedy may be available to the other Party against a Third Party for such Liability, then the other Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the incurring Party, at the incurring Party's expense, to permit the incurring Party to obtain the benefits of such legal or equitable remedy against the Third Party. (c) If payment is made by or on behalf of any Indemnifying Party to any Indemnitee in connection with any Third-Party Claim, such Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to and shall stand in the place of such Indemnitee as to any events or circumstances in respect of which such Indemnitee may have any right, defense or claim relating to such Third-Party Claim against any claimant or plaintiff asserting such Third-Party Claim or against any other Person. Such Indemnitee shall cooperate with such Indemnifying Party in a reasonable manner, and at the cost and expense of such Indemnifying Party, in prosecuting any subrogated right, defense or claim. (d) In the event of an Action in which the Indemnifying Party is not a named defendant, if either the Indemnitee or Indemnifying Party shall so request, the Parties shall endeavor to substitute the Indemnifying Party for the named defendant or otherwise add the Indemnifying Party as party thereto, if at all practicable. If such substitution or addition cannot be achieved for any reason or is not requested, the named defendant shall allow the Indemnifying Party to manage the Action as set forth in this Section 10, and the Indemnifying Party shall fully indemnify the named defendant against all costs of defending the Action (including court costs, sanctions imposed by a court, attorneys' fees, experts fees and all other external expenses), the costs of any judgment or settlement, and the cost of any interest or penalties relating to any judgment or settlement with respect to such Third-Party Claim. -64-

Supply Chain Security. 14.1 Supply Chain Representations.

Manufacturer represents, warrants and covenants to Customer that:

Manufacturer has reviewed its supply chain security procedures and that these procedures and their implementation are, and shall remain during the Term of this Agreement, in accordance with the importer security criteria set forth by the "C-TPAT." Manufacturer represents and warrants that it has developed and implemented, or shall develop and implement within sixty (60) calendar days of its execution of this Agreement, procedures for periodically reviewing and, if necessary, improving its supply chain security procedures to assure compliance with C-TPAT minimum security criteria. 14.2 C-TPAT.

Manufacturer acknowledges that Customer is a certified member of C-TPAT. As a C-TPAT member, Customer is required to make periodic assessment of its international supply chain based upon C-TPAT security criteria. Manufacturer agrees to conduct and document an annual security audit at each of its Facilities and to take all necessary corrective actions to ensure the continued participation of Customer in C- TPAT. Manufacturer agrees to share with Customer the results of such annual audits and agrees to prepare and submit to Customer a report on the corrective actions taken in response thereto. In addition, Customer may audit Manufacturer's Records and Facilities for the purpose of verifying that Manufacturer's procedures are in accordance with the C-TPAT security criteria, and Manufacturer shall provide Customer with access to Manufacturer's Records and Facilities reasonably necessary for the purpose of conducting such audit. Manufacturer agrees to notify Customer of any event that has resulted in or threatens the loss of its C-TPAT Benefits (if it is a member of the C-TPAT program) or alternatively jeopardizes Customer's retention of its own C-TPAT Benefits. In an effort to secure each part of the supply chain, Manufacturer agrees to work in good faith to become a member of the C-TPAT program, if Manufacturer is organized or incorporated in the United States, Mexico or Canada, or the equivalent supply chain security program criteria administered by the customs administration in Manufacturer's home country if Manufacturer is not organized or incorporated in the United States, Mexico or Canada. -69-

Manufacturer shall make such Records readily available for such audit. Any Records or information accessed or otherwise obtained by Customer or its representatives in connection with any audit (including any audit pursuant to Section 3.4) shall be deemed Manufacturer's confidential and proprietary Information and each representative of Customer will be subject to non-use and other confidentiality obligations substantially comparable to those set forth herein for Customer. Except as otherwise provided in Section 3.4, if any financial audit reveals that Manufacturer has overcharged Customer, Manufacturer shall reimburse Customer for such overcharge within thirty (30) days of Manufacturer's receipt of the relevant audit results, and in the event that any such overcharge equals an amount equal to or greater than five percent (5%) of the total amounts invoiced during the period under such audit, then Manufacturer shall promptly reimburse Customer for all reasonable Third Party costs and expenses actually incurred in the conduct of such audit.
