Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, On2 shall not unreasonably withhold acceptance of any Deliverable.

      3.2 Program Errors. During the Term, Wildform shall resolve Program Errors in the manner provided in Exhibit A.

                                    ARTICLE V

                                 CONFIDENTIALITY

      5.1 Use of Confidential Information. The Receiving Party represents and warrants to the Disclosing Party that:

            5.1.1 it will keep and maintain all Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party in strict confidence, using such degree of care as is appropriate to avoid unauthorized use or disclosure;

            5.1.2 it will not, directly or indirectly, disclose any Confidential Information to any third party, except as contemplated by this Agreement or with the Disclosing Party's prior written consent;

            5.1.3 it will not make use of any Confidential Information for its own purposes, such as creation of a competitive product; or for the benefit of anyone or any entity other than as contemplated by this Agreement;

            5.1.4 upon the Disclosing Party's written request, at the earlier of the end of the Term, or receipt of notice from the Disclosing Party of a breach by it of this Agreement or an Annex, the Receiving Party will deliver promptly to the Disclosing Party or, at the Receiving Party's option, will destroy all memoranda, notes, records, reports, media and other documents and materials (and all copies thereof) regarding or including any Confidential Information which the Receiving Party may then possess or have under its control; and

            5.1.5 it will take no action with respect to the Confidential Information that is inconsistent with its confidential and proprietary nature.

      5.2 Exceptions to Non-Disclosure Obligations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Receiving Party shall be permitted to disclose Confidential Information without any violation of this Agreement if such disclosure is required by law, but in such event the Receiving Party shall notify the Disclosing Party in writing in advance of such disclosure, and provide the Disclosing Party with copies of any related information so that the Disclosing Party may take appropriate action to protect its Confidential Information. The Receiving Party acknowledges that the disclosure of Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party may cause irreparable injury to the Disclosing Party and damages that may be difficult to ascertain. The Disclosing Party shall, therefore, be entitled to injunctive relief upon a disclosure or threatened disclosure of any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party in violation of this Agreement, in addition to such other remedies as may be available at law or in equity. Without limitation of the foregoing, the Receiving Party shall promptly advise the Disclosing Party in the event that the Receiving Party learns or has reason to believe that any person or entity that has had access to Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party through the Receiving Party has violated or intends to violate the terms of this Agreement.

      5.3 Receiving Party's Duty of Care. Receiving Party shall protect the Confidential Information from unauthorized use or disclosure by exercising the same degree of care that Receiving Party uses with respect to information of its own of a similar nature, but in no event less than reasonable care, until five (5) years from the later of the Effective Date or the date of receipt of such Confidential Information. Notwithstanding the prior sentence, with respect to Receiving Party's employees, Receiving Party shall only disclose Confidential Information to a Receiving Party employee who has a need to know such Confidential Information for purposes of this Agreement or any customer sublicense and is informed of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information. The foregoing notwithstanding, each Party shall be liable for any failure by such Party's employees, agents or representatives to comply with the





provisions of this Section 5 as fully as if such employees, agents or representatives were a party to this Agreement.

      6.1 On2 Warranties. On2 makes the following representations and warranties to Wildform.

      (a)   Authorization; Power and Authority. On2 (i) is a corporation duly             organized under the laws of the state of Delaware, and (ii) has the             requisite corporate power and corporate authority to enter into and             perform its obligations under this Agreement.

The Payment Shares to be issued by On2 to Wildform             hereunder: (i) are duly authorized; and (ii) when issued and             exchanged pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, will be validly             issued, fully paid, non-assessable and not subject to preemptive             rights; and (iii) when issued and exchanged pursuant to the terms of             this Agreement, shall have been approved for listing on the American             Stock Exchange (or such other trading market or exchange on which             the Common Stock is listed or quoted for trading on the date in             question).

      6.2 Wildform Warranties. Wildform makes the following representations and warranties to On2.

      (a)   Authorization; Power and Authority. Wildform (i) is a corporation             duly organized under the laws of the State of California, (ii) has             the requisite corporate power and corporate authority to enter into             and perform its obligations under this Agreement, and (iii) to the             best of Wildform's knowledge as of the Effective Date, the             Deliverables marked as Deliverable #2 will not infringe any             Intellectual Property Rights held by any third party.

      (b)   Investment Representation. Wildform acknowledges that it is aware             that the Payment Shares have not been registered under the Act.             Wildform represents and warrants to the Buyer that such Wildform is             acquiring the Payment Shares for investment purposes and not with a             view to or for sale in connection with any distribution thereof or             with any present intention of selling the Payment Shares in             connection with a distribution.

            and that there is no assurance that Buyer's business or operations             will be successful. Wildform has considered carefully the risks             attendant to an investment in the Payment Shares and acknowledges             that, as a consequence of such risks, such Wildform could lose its             entire investment in the Payment Shares. Wildform acknowledges that,             at a reasonable time prior to the Effective Date, Buyer furnished to             it the information specified in paragraph (b)2(ii)(A) or (B) of, and             in either event the information specified in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(C)             of, Rule 502 promulgated under Exchange Act.

      (c)   Restricted Securities. Wildform understands that the Payment Shares             will be "restricted securities" under applicable federal securities             laws and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission             promulgated thereunder. Wildform acknowledges that it may dispose of             the Payment Shares only pursuant to an effective registration             statement under the Act or an exception from registration if             available. Wildform further understands that, except as provided in             the Registration Rights Agreement (as defined below), Buyer has no             obligation to register the sale of the Payment Shares or take any             other action so as to permit sales pursuant to the Act. Wildform             further understands that applicable state securities laws may impose             additional constraints upon the sale of securities

      6.3 No Warranty. EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN SUBSECTIONS 6.1 AND 6.2 ABOVE, THE DELIVERABLES AND INCORPORATED TECHNOLOGY ARE PROVIDED "AS-IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND AND BOTH PARTIES EXPRESSLY AGREE AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE DELIVERABLES AND INCORPORATED TECHNOLOGY ARE BEING PROVIDED WITHOUT ANY REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, ARISING OUT OF A COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE OR OTHERWISE INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, MERCHANTABLE QUALITY, FITNESS OR ADEQUACY FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR USE, QUALITY, PRODUCTIVENESS, CAPACITY, OR THAT THE OPERATION OF THE DELIVERABLES OR INCORPORTED TECHNOLOGY WILL BE ERROR-FREE.
