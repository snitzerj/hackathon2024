12.      LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

         EXCEPT UNDER SECTION 11(a), IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE TO          THE OTHER FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES,          WHETHER BASED ON BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR          OTHERWISE, WHETHER OR NOT THAT PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE          POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE. THE LIABILITY OF EXCITE FOR DAMAGES OR          ALLEGED DAMAGES HEREUNDER, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER          LEGAL THEORY, IS LIMITED TO, AND WILL NOT EXCEED, THE TOTAL AMOUNTS          PREVIOUSLY PAID OR TO BE PAID BY NETGROCER TO EXCITE HEREUNDER [*]

13.      DISPUTE RESOLUTION

         a)       The parties agree that any breach of either of the parties'                   obligations regarding trademarks, service marks or trade                   names and/or confidentiality would result in irreparable                   injury for which there is no adequate remedy at law.                   Therefore, in the event of any breach or threatened breach of                   a party's obligations regarding trademarks, service marks or                   trade names or confidentiality, the aggrieved party will be                   entitled to seek equitable relief in addition to its other                   available legal remedies in a court of competent                   jurisdiction.

                                      -12-

         b)       In the event of disputes between the parties arising from or                   concerning in any manner the subject matter of this





                  Agreement, other than disputes arising from or concerning                   trademarks, service marks or trade names and/or                   confidentiality, the parties will first attempt to resolve                   the dispute(s) through good faith negotiation. In the event                   that the dispute(s) cannot be resolved through good faith                   negotiation, the parties will refer the dispute(s) to a                   mutually acceptable mediator for hearing.

         c)       In the event that disputes between the parties arising from                   or concerning in any manner the subject matter of this                   Agreement, other than disputes arising from or concerning                   trademarks, service marks or trade names and/or                   confidentiality, cannot be resolved through good faith                   negotiation and mediation, the parties will refer the                   dispute(s) to the American Arbitration Association for                   resolution through binding arbitration by a single arbitrator                   pursuant to the American Arbitration Association's rules                   applicable to commercial disputes.

14.      GENERAL

         a)       Assignment. Neither party may assign this Agreement, in whole                   or in part, without the other party's written consent (which                   will not be unreasonably withheld), except that no such                   consent will be required in connection with (i) a merger,                   reorganization or sale of all, or substantially all, of such                   party's assets or (ii) the assignment and/or delegation of                   such party's rights and responsibilities hereunder to a                   wholly-owned subsidiary or joint venture in which that party                   holds an interest. Any attempt to assign this Agreement other                   than as permitted above will be null and void.

         b)       Governing Law. This Agreement will be governed by and                   construed in accordance with the laws of the State of                   California, notwithstanding the actual state or country of                   residence or incorporation of NetGrocer.

         c)       Notice. Any notice under this Agreement will be in writing                   and delivered by personal delivery, express courier,                   confirmed facsimile, confirmed email or certified or                   registered mail, return receipt requested, and will be deemed                   given upon personal delivery, one (1) day after deposit with                   express courier, upon confirmation of receipt of facsimile or                   email or five (5) days after deposit in the mail. Notices                   will be sent to a party at its address set forth below or                   such other address as that party may specify in writing                   pursuant to this Section.

         d)       No Agency. The parties are independent contractors and will                   have no power or authority to assume or create any obligation                   or responsibility on behalf of each other. This Agreement                   will not be construed to create or imply any partnership,                   agency or joint venture.

                                      -13-

         e)       Force Majeure. Any delay in or failure of performance by                   either party under this Agreement will not be considered a                   breach of this Agreement and will be excused to the extent                   caused by any occurrence beyond the reasonable control of                   such party including, but not limited to, acts of God, power                   outages and governmental restrictions. Notwithstanding the                   foregoing, either party may terminate the Agreement in the                   event that a delay due to force majeure continues for a                   period of sixty (60) uninterrupted days.

         f)       Severability. In the event that any of the provisions of this                   Agreement are held by to be unenforceable by a court or                   arbitrator, the remaining portions of the Agreement will                   remain in full force and effect.

         g)       Entire Agreement. This Agreement is the complete and                   exclusive agreement between the parties with respect to the                   subject matter hereof, superseding any prior agreements and                   communications (both written and oral) regarding such subject                   matter. This Agreement may only be modified, or any rights                   under it waived, by a written document executed by both                   parties.
