To the extent  that such headcount reductions are effected through compulsory redundancies which affect the Transferring Employees,  DCL understands that SEV will seek to establish that such redundancies are for an economic technical or organisational  reason entailing a change in the workforce. Accordingly, DCL agrees that (subject to Clause 11.7) in the event that SEV  terminates the employment of any of the Transferring Employees on the ground of redundancy and:-     11.6.1 the date on which the applicable redundancy notice is issued falls on or within a period of 6 months commencing on  and including the Commencement Date; and     11.6.2 a copy of such redundancy notice is served (in accordance with clause 32.1) upon DCL within the same period;     then DCL will reimburse the Redundancy Costs validly incurred by SEV in association with such termination(s) to SEV  within 14 days of receipt of an invoice from SEV detailing the name of the Transferring Employee, the effective date of  termination of their employment and the date and amount of any payment of the Redundancy Costs (including a  breakdown of PAYE deducted).     11.7 DCL will reimburse Redundancy Costs to SEV in accordance with Clause 11.6 up to a maximum total sum as set out in  Schedule Two ("the Redundancy Cap"). However, in the event that the basis of calculation of the Redundancy Costs  applicable to all or any of the Transferring Employees as stated in Schedule Two ("the Anticipated Redundancy Costs") is  challenged (whether by one or more of the Transferring Employees or by any trade union, staff association or staff body  recognised by DCL or SEV in respect of all or any of the Transferring Employees) with the result that the Anticipated  Redundancy Costs are agreed by the parties or adjudged by a competent court or tribunal to be less than the actual  Redundancy Costs ("the Actual Redundancy Costs"), DCL agrees to forthwith pay to SEV in addition to the Anticipated  Redundancy Costs such sum as represents the difference between the Anticipated Redundancy Costs and the Actual  Redundancy Costs; provided that DCL's liability in respect of such difference shall not exceed the sum of [***]     [***]     11.8 SEV will for the purposes of its accounts and tax return consider whether any payment received from DCL under the terms of  Clause 11.6 can be treated as a non taxable income receipt with a claim being made for the Redundancy Costs as deductible  for corporation tax purposes.

Accordingly, and in the event that;     (i) DCL completes the acquisition of a New Undertaking and becomes the employer of the New Employees;     (ii) DCL notifies SEV of its desire for SEV to provide such Maintenance Services in respect of such New Undertaking;     (iii) SEV is prepared to provide such Maintenance Services in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; and     (iv) the parties agree that the Now Employees are to be employed by SEV (whether in accordance with the Regulations or  otherwise as the case may be) in order to enable SEV to provide such Maintenance Services.     the parties agree to use all reasonable endeavors to effect and document the employment by SEV of the New Employees  (again whether in accordance with the Regulations or otherwise as the case may be) and the inclusion of the applicable  vehicles within the scope of this Agreement within such timescale as the parties may agree (both parties acting reasonably  in the circumstances). For the avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that;     11.17.1 where the New Employees are to transfer to SEV in accordance with the Regulations then the terms of such transfer  shall be in substantially the same form as that wording set out in this Agreement in respect of the Transferring  Employees; and     11.17.2 whether the New Employees are to be employed by SEV pursuant to the Regulations or otherwise the agreement  between SEV and DCL providing for their employment by SEV shell include provisions which are the same or  substantially the same as clauses 18, 19 and 20 of this Agreement.     17

     ***Confidential treatment requested pursuant to a request for confidential treatment filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Omitted  portions have been filed separately with the Commission.     APPENDIX     Code of Practice on Acceptable Standards of Maintenance     The Department of Transport accepts that many operators, particularly those new to the profession, are unaware of what is needed to meet the  required standards, and have issued, in consultation with representatives of the industry a Code of Practice to provide guidance for operators on  what is needed for good maintenance. The Code is entitled Guide to Maintaining Roadworthiness, and is published by HMSO.     The Preface to the Code repeats the caveat in the Department's Guide to Operator Licensing that the ultimate test of an operator's maintenance  system is the condition of his vehicles on the road.     It assures operators that if their maintenance systems accord with the Code they will be acceptable to Traffic Commissioners, providing the  resulting condition of their vehicles is satisfactory. However, it adds a rider that Traffic Commissioners remain free to require more stringent  arrangements than those which the operator proposes.     Advice contained in the code     The Code offers much sensible advice on what is acceptable. It thus fills the gap which previously existed between the legal requirement for safe  operation and the means by which this can be fulfilled. The Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA) is now much more specific than  hitherto about these means.     VOSA examiners have always been prepared to visit operators and advise them on their maintenance. The VOSA is now an Executive Agency with  a commercial remit, self funded by the fees it charges for inspections it provides for a commercial fee, courses for goods vehicle operators' staffs  responsible for inspecting vehicles.     The Code places considerable emphasis on regular inspections of vehicles, including a daily "walkround check", the keeping of records of  inspections (Croners' Road Transport Operation: Records and Procedures gives valuable information on the types of records to be kept), and the  importance of driver defect reports (including the making of NIL Defects reports where appropriate).     The practice of keeping defect reports and records of inspection for 15 months is confirmed in the Code.     A clear indication is given that safety inspections should follow a pattern based on time, and that the interval of time between inspections should  be determined by operating conditions.     Operators are advised to own or have access to means of measuring braking efficiency. The VOSA is currently offering, on an experimental basis,  this facility to operators at some goods vehicle testing stations.     32





     ***Confidential treatment requested pursuant to a request for confidential treatment filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Omitted  portions have been filed separately with the Commission.     Maintenance Staff     Vehicle maintenance must be carried out by qualified maintenance staff so that the driver is well supported in his operational duties thus enabling  him to give maximum productivity during his working hours.     Fleet maintenance should be planned, with regular vehicle testing and inspection, to minimise breakdowns on the road and to assist maximum  vehicle utilisation.     The Driver's Responsibilities     The driver is the operator's representative and as such is responsible — with his employer — for any infringement of the law and he should  therefore have a working knowledge of the appropriate regulations.     Whatever the standards laid down by vehicle operators for maintenance and servicing, ultimately it is the driver who is responsible for reporting  on performances He, more than anyone else, handles the vehicle under load, which is the only time when a true test of vehicle performance can be  obtained. The driver, therefore, must ensure that he reports in good time, to the maintenance staff, any defects likely to infringe the law or affect  the safety requirements. For such purposes a Vehicle Defects Report Sheet should be supplied by the operator to his driver so that any  abnormalities can be recorded and dealt with as soon as possible.     The items for checking and reporting on the Defects Report Sheet are:     (a) fuel, oil and water     (b) brakes     (c) tyre condition and inflation pressures, spare wheel and jack     (d) wheel security, making sure that:     (i) all nuts and studs are tight     (ii) no nuts or studs are missing     (iii) no cracks are evident around wheel holes and where the centre joins the rim     (iv) where a wheel has been replaced recently the nuts are tight (these should be checked again after 30 minutes of the work being carried out)     Note: A vehicle should not be moved if any problems are found which should be reported immediately.     (e) driving mirrors, windscreen wipers and washers     (f) lights and reflectors     (g) stop-lights and direction indicators      (h) steering     33
