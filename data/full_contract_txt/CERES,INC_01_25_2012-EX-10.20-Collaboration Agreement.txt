CERES will respond in writing within thirty (30) days  or such other period of time as the Parties may agree in writing. In exceptional urgent cases, when asked by IGER, CERES will respond as  soon as reasonably possible. Further, where Articles 3.2.1 or 3.2.2 refer to Ceres' access to results or right to use and commercially exploit  such results, IGER will report such results to CERES in compliance with the terms hereof.

3.2.4 Whenever rights are granted to IGER pursuant to agreements referred to in Articles 3.2.1 or 3.2.2 ("Third Party Agreement Rights"), the  provisions of this Agreement about the grant of rights by IGER to CERES will apply and such Third Party Agreement Rights shall be treated  as IGER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY (unless they qualify as JOINT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY under the circumstances).

3.3 During the term of this Agreement, IGER will notify CERES, in writing, of any contemplated internal (i.e. not involving third parties but  including government-funded) research activities (i.e., non-RESEARCH PROJECTS) that specifically involve the COLLABORATION CROPS,  except research activities that relate solely to environmental impact, carbon sequestration, climate change or agronomy studies. If CERES so  requests, the Parties will negotiate in good faith to agree on a new RESEARCH PROJECT and accompanying SCHEDULE or an amendment to an  existing SCHEDULE on the basis of such research proposal. If CERES does not request such negotiations, or if the Parties fail to reach agreement  on a new SCHEDULE (or amendment to an existing SCHEDULE) within thirty (30) days (or such other time period as the Parties may agree) from  IGER's notice, IGER will have the right, subject to Articles 3.2 and 5.3, to proceed to such internal research, and IGER will provide a written report  to CERES on the results of such research. CERES is hereby granted a first option, to be exercised by written notice within thirty (30) days from         CERES-IGER Collaboration Agreement    Page 10 of 75







IGER's aforementioned written report or such other time period as the Parties may agree to be granted the same right as set forth in Article 5.3 to  commercialize any results of such activities.

3.3.1 If CERES exercises its option to commercialize under Article 3.3, CERES and IGER shall negotiate the terms of a commercialization  agreement that covers the reported result with reference to any commercialization agreement then in existence between the Parties or the model  license agreement or remuneration principles included herein (as applicable). If, despite the Parties' good faith efforts, CERES and IGER are  unable to agree upon the terms and conditions of such agreement within one hundred and eighty (180) days after commencing good faith  negotiations, CERES shall have the right to start the dispute resolution procedure in Article 15 for any outstanding unresolved issues.

3.3.2 If CERES declines to exercise the option under Article 3.3 or fails to respond within thirty (30) days of IGER's notice under Article 3.3, then  IGER shall then be free to commercially exploit the results or offer rights in such results to third parties in any and all crops.

3.3.3 IGER will have no restrictions to undertake internal (i.e. not involving third parties but including government-funded) research activities  that involve COLLABORATION CROPS but relate solely to environmental impact, carbon sequestration, climate change or agronomy studies.  IGER will use all reasonable efforts to inform CERES of the results of any such activities.

4.1 "JOINT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY" shall mean (a) all patentable inventions conceived, discovered, developed and/or reduced to practice (i)  jointly by one or more employees, agents, or students of CERES and by one or more employees, agents, or students of IGER in the performance of  any RESEARCH PROJECT(S) or (ii) by one or more employees, agents or students of IGER in the performance of any RESEARCH PROJECT(S) to  the extent CERES provides a financial contribution for such RESEARCH PROJECT, which is not less than twenty-five percent (25%) of either the  overall cost of such RESEARCH PROJECT or of the activity during which the invention was made, unless expressly provided otherwise in a  SCHEDULE; (b) patents, patent applications, plant variety rights, plant variety right applications, reissues, continuations, continuations-in-part  and divisionals claiming such patentable inventions in any country of the world; (c) all trade secrets and copyrighted works created jointly by one  or more employees, agents, or students of CERES and by one or more employees, agents, or students of IGER in the performance of any  RESEARCH PROJECT(S); and (d) all germplasm and plant varieties created in the performance of plant breeding activities in the performance of  any RESEARCH PROJECT(S).

4.2 "CERES INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY" shall mean (a) all patentable inventions conceived, discovered, developed, and/or reduced to practice  by one or more employees, agents, or students of CERES in the performance of any RESEARCH PROJECT(S), except as set forth in Article 4.1; (b)  patents, patent applications, plant variety rights, plant variety right applications, reissues, continuations, continuations-in-part, and divisionals  claiming such patentable inventions in any country of the world; and (c) all trade secrets and copyrighted works created by one or more  employees, agents, or students of CERES in the performance of any RESEARCH PROJECT(S) .

4.5.1 Any Party asserting that certain intellectual property is BACKGROUND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY shall have the burden of  substantiating such claim, if necessary, with tangible evidence, including but not limited to paper or electronic records.

4.5.2 The Parties acknowledge and agree that all relevant BACKGROUND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY for a RESEARCH PROJECT should be  set forth within the corresponding SCHEDULE. With respect to each element of BACKGROUND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY listed in a  SCHEDULE, the listing Party shall include the following: ownership or licensed rights (exclusive or non-exclusive) held by the listing Party (if  no ownership) with respect to the COLLABORATION CROPS. Notwithstanding, subject to Article 4.5.1, failure to specifically set forth such  BACKGROUND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY in a SCHEDULE will not foreclose a later claim that certain intellectual property is  BACKGROUND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

4.6 CERES and IGER shall have an undivided interest in JOINT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. Consequently, any and all patent applications or  plant variety rights applications that cover JOINT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY shall be assigned jointly to CERES and IGER as soon as  practicable.

4.6.1 All rights and title to CERES INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY and CERES BACKGROUND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY shall belong to  CERES, and IGER shall not acquire any interest in the same by its performance under this Agreement.

4.6.2 All rights and title to IGER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY and IGER BACKGROUND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY shall belong to IGER,  and CERES shall not         CERES-IGER Collaboration Agreement    Page 12 of 75







acquire any interest in the same by its performance under this Agreement, except as expressly provided in this Agreement.

4.7 Each Party will notify the other Party, in writing ("INVENTION NOTICE"), within thirty (30) days of reduction to practice or knowledge of  conception or discovery of JOINT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, and each INVENTION NOTICE will describe the JOINT INTELLECTUAL  PROPERTY with sufficient specificity to allow assessment by the other Party.

4.8 The Parties shall consult as soon as possible but in any case within twenty (20) days of receiving an INVENTION NOTICE whether to proceed  to obtain intellectual property protection on the disclosed JOINT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY or whether to protect the same through other  methods. CERES shall have the first option to pursue such protection in its best judgment in the joint names of both Parties. If CERES so elects by  written notice within sixty (60) days of such initial consultation, CERES shall be the "ADMINISTERING PARTY" for the purposes of this  Agreement.

4.8.1 The ADMINISTERING PARTY shall be responsible for retaining counsel, overseeing the process of securing intellectual property  protection (i.e., the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent or plant variety rights application(s)) and maintaining intellectual property  protection for the mutual benefit of the Parties, in its best judgment, for that which it has prosecution responsibility. In addition to other  reporting responsibilities provided below, the ADMINISTERING PARTY shall promptly notify the other Party following retention of counsel.  The Parties will provide, and cause their respective employees, agents and students to provide, all reasonable assistance which may be required  in connection with the filing and prosecution of such intellectual property rights, including without limitation the signing of documents.

4.8.2 The ADMINISTERING PARTY shall keep the non-administering Party advised as to all developments with respect to all patent and plant  variety rights application(s) and issued patents and plant variety rights covering jointly owned JOINT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, which  includes supplying copies of all papers received and filed in connection with such applications and patents in sufficient time for the non- administering Party to comment thereon.

4.9 CERES agrees to bear all legal expenses incurred by CERES as an ADMINISTERING PARTY in obtaining and maintaining patents and plant  variety rights, U.S. and other, covering JOINT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

4.10 If CERES does not elect to file an application for a patent or plant variety rights or continue maintenance of a patent or plant variety rights in a  particular country, consistent with the consultation of Article 4.8, IGER may file such application, continue such prosecution, or maintain such  patent or plant variety rights at its own expense; provided however, that prior to filing any such application IGER will not take any action or  proceed to any filing which would lead to the possible disclosure of information which CERES wishes to keep confidential, as notified by CERES to  IGER in writing. For any such application, patent or plant variety rights, IGER shall serve as the ADMINISTERING PARTY.

17. GENERAL.

17.1 Entire Agreement/Modifications.

This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof, and there are no  representations, warranties, covenants or obligations except as set forth herein. This Agreement supersedes all prior and contemporaneous  agreements, understandings, negotiations and discussions, written or oral, of the Parties hereto relating to the subject matter hereof. This  Agreement and its SCHEDULES may only be amended, modified or superseded by a writing executed by the authorized representatives of the  Parties hereto. It is anticipated that SCHEDULES will be attached to and become part of this Agreement as new RESEARCH PROJECTS are  undertaken, as described in Article 1.1.

17.2 Severability.

This Agreement, to the greatest extent possible, shall be construed so as to give validity to all of the provisions hereof. If any provision of this  Agreement is or becomes invalid, is ruled illegal by a court of competent jurisdiction or is deemed unenforceable under the current applicable law  from time to time in effect during the term of this Agreement, the remainder of this Agreement will not be affected or impaired thereby and will  continue to be construed to the maximum extent permitted by law. In lieu of each provision which is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, there will be  substituted or added as part of this Agreement by mutual written agreement of the Parties, a provision which will be as similar as possible, in  economic and business objectives as intended by the Parties to such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision, but will be valid, legal and  enforceable.

17.3 Waiver.

No failure or delay by either Party in exercising any right or remedy under this Agreement will waive any provision of this Agreement. Nor will any  single or partial exercise by either Party of any right or remedy under this Agreement preclude it from otherwise or further exercising any rights or  remedies which it may have, or any other rights or remedies granted by any law or any related document.

17.4 Enforcement.

In the event an action is commenced by either Party against the other to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement, the prevailing Party shall  be entitled to recover from the other Party reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs and necessary disbursements incurred in connection with such  action.         CERES-IGER Collaboration Agreement    Page 27 of 75







17.5 Assignablility.

This Agreement binds and enures to the benefit of the Parties, their successor or assigns, but may not be assigned by either Party without the  prior written consent of the other Party; provided however, CERES shall have the right to assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement to  any Affiliated Company without such prior consent. Each Party shall have the right to assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement to a  third party in conjunction with the transfer to such third party of substantially all of the assets of such Party associated with performance under  this Agreement without such prior consent. "Affiliated Company" defined as any company owned or controlled by, under common control with or  controlling CERES, "control" meaning in this context the direct or indirect ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the voting stock/shares of a  company, or the power to nominate at least half of the directors.

17.6 Force Majeure.

No Party shall be responsible to the other Party for delay or failure in performance of any the obligations imposed by this Agreement, provided  such failure shall be occasioned by fire, flood, explosion, lightning, wind storm, hailstorm, earthquake, subsidence of soil, failure of machinery or  equipment or supply of materials, discontinuity in the supply of power, court order or governmental interference, terrorist attacks, civil commotion,  riot, war, strikes, labor disturbances, transportation difficulties, labor shortage, natural genetic variation of any living matter or by any other cause  of like or unlike nature beyond the reasonable control and without fault or negligence of such Party.

18. SPECIAL CONDITIONS IN CONNECTION WITH DEFRA AGREEMENT NF 0426.

The Parties acknowledge that Defra is expected to assign or license exclusively to IGER any rights in Intellectual Property which would vest in  Defra or the Crown or the Secretary of State pursuant to the DEFRA agreement NF 0426. If IGER receives an exclusive license from Defra rather  than an assignment of rights, the following will apply.

18.1 To the extent the license grant to CERES on IGER BACKGROUND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY in Article 5.3.2 relates to IGER  BACKGROUND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY that constitutes Intellectual Property to which rights vest in Defra or the Crown or the Secretary  of State, the word "license" will be read as "sublicense" and all other terms of such Article will remain unchanged.

18.2 To the extent that IGER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY or JOINT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY created in a RESEARCH PROJECT  constitutes or includes Intellectual Property to which rights vest in Defra or the Crown or the Secretary of State, any conveyance or grant of  rights or licenses by IGER to CERES in this Agreement with respect to such IGER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY or JOINT INTELLECTUAL  PROPERTY, will be read as the grant of an exclusive sublicense under IGER's exclusive license from Defra.

9.1 Each Party shall notify the other of any suspected infringement of any INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS covering the LICENSED  VARIETY. CERES will have the exclusive right, but no obligation, at its own discretion and expense, to take any action to enforce and to initiate  and prosecute suits for infringement of the INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. CERES and IGER will consult with each other upon a course of  action and enforcement strategy.

SCHEDULE 1—Plant Breeding, Markers, Composition, Agronomy and Propagation

THIS SCHEDULE is made this 1st day of April, 2007.

WHEREAS, CERES and IGER have entered into a Collaboration Agreement ("CA"), dated April 1, 2007, which allows for the undertaking of  RESEARCH PROJECTS pursuant to SCHEDULES, these terms being defined in the CA; and

THEREFORE, the Parties have agreed to undertake the following RESEARCH PROJECT as defined herein on the following terms and conditions:

GENERAL

RESEARCH PROJECT TITLE: Developing Miscanthus Cultivars for Use in Bioenergy Production

Development of Miscanthus Species for Energy Crops — Scientific Overview

Miscanthus species are capable of producing large quantities of biomass with minimal inputs over a wide geographic range. CERES and IGER aim  to develop commercial biomass crops from leading Miscanthus lines via a collaboration with 2 major foci: I) propagation; and II) breeding. These  are described in turn below.

I. Propagation.

The major barrier to profitable Miscanthus cropping is efficient and inexpensive propagation. In the UK, subsidy support makes [***] of  Miscanthus x giganteus an economically viable planting method. This is not the case in [***], where there is no government support for the crop  and initial [***] from which to generate planting material is extremely limited.

It is not commercially feasible to produce Miscanthus on a large scale in [***] from traditional [***] schemes. Success of Miscanthus crops for  large markets will be determined by development of

      BETWEEN   CERES, INC. ("CERES"), a Delaware corporation, having its principal place of business at 1535 Rancho Conejo Blvd., Thousand  Oaks, CA 91320, United States of America, and



INSTITUTE OF GRASSLAND AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH ("IGER"), a company limited by guarantee, registered in  England No. 473456 and a registered Charity No. 272150, having an office at Plas Gogerddan, Aberystwyth, Ceredigion, SY23 3EB,  United Kingdom

A.   Unless otherwise specified herein, the terms of the CA shall apply to this SCHEDULE.

B.   In the event of any difference between the terms of this SCHEDULE and the CA, then the terms of this SCHEDULE shall prevail.

I.A.  Rationale:







cost-effective propagation technology, and the magnitude of success depends on the speed with which this technology can be developed.

All other lines of crop development research in this collaboration will be dependent on success with propagation.

To be successful, Miscanthus must be planted from small, homogenous propagules that can be cheaply and rapidly produced, flow-ably  transported, stored for months and consistently emerge after planting. In theory, the best propagule for Miscanthus production is seed. However,  propagation of Miscanthus from seed is complicated and difficult. Development of [***] Miscanthus varieties will be a [***] of the [***] of this  collaboration.

An alternative approach to seed in the short term is to [***] Miscanthus from [***] as is common in [***]. [***] is more feasible with decreasing  [***] and has not been thoroughly explored in Europe. The potential of [***] should be investigated from both an applied and basic perspective.  It was agreed that while the approach is more likely to work in [***], it should also include x [***] and at least initially [***].

Development of [***] and [***] techniques for [***] Miscanthus cropping systems will utilize a combination of theoretical and applied methods  in the lab, glasshouse and field.

CERES-IGER SCHEDULE 1

Page 2 of 10

Confidential Treatment Requested and the Redacted Material has been separately filed with the Commission

I.B.  Goal: Applied methods for effective [***] of Miscanthus hybrids.

      I.B.i. Objective 1: Identify [***] techniques and optimize them with existing hybrids.

      Methods: Screen [***], x [***] and other species at least initially for [***] ability with multiple techniques in a broad range of factorial field  and glasshouse experiments. Glasshouse experiments can be conducted year-round at IGER and at CERES in Thousand Oaks, CA.  Additional experiments may be conducted at other CERES locations added at a later date. Field experiments will be conducted [***] at IGER  and begin in multiple locations in [***] during the three (3) year period of this SCHEDULE.

      I.B.ii. Objective 2: More basic genetic and physiological work aimed at characterising and understanding [***].

      Methods: A series of experiments into the [***] of [***] with a focus on inducing plant growth from [***] ([***] and [***]) [***]. Work  should explore [***] cues ([***], [***], [***]) as well as [***] ([***]). Explore [***] and score in [***] if possible, to locate [***].  Evaluate candidate [***] (from Arabidopsis, [***] if possible and other species) promoting [***] frequency.

I.C.  Goal: Applied methods for effective [***] of Miscanthus hybrids.

      I.C.i. Objective 1: Demonstrate potential of [***] and create protocols.

      Methods: Check [***] of [***] and [***] of a wide range of [***] in response to [***] and [***] with a combination of [***], glasshouse  and finally field experiments. Interpret results in context of [***] range, genotype and [***] conditions under which the [***] was [***].  Produce guidelines for effective [***] and [***].

I.D.  Goal: [***] based systems for rapid [***] of germplasm and plants to be used in [***].







II. Breeding

Miscanthus is an unimproved plant species with great potential as an energy crop. [***] has not yet been fully collected and characterized.  Miscanthus species are capable of crossing with [***] — a characteristic that has long been exploited in [***] where Miscanthus germplasm is  used to [***]. The use of Miscanthus for biomass is a relatively new area, thus initial collection and evaluation of germplasm may discover lines  already suited to the commercial market, and will certainly provide the base for the breeding needed to develop [***] into dedicated bioenergy  crops. This breeding programme will employ traditional methodology to [***] and [***] for traits of interest. Molecular markers will be developed  to assist identification of traits and expedite development of elite lines. Major traits of interest include increased biomass production, altered  composition for improved conversion to fuel, [***] tolerance and seed suitable to produce [***] ([***]) [***].

As lines with commercial potential are identified they will be selected for direct field trialing at IGER and/or at CERES locations in [***] to speed up  commercial variety development.

CERES-IGER SCHEDULE 1

Confidential Treatment Requested and the Redacted Material has been separately filed with the Commission

      I.D.i. Objective 1: Provide plants for [***] based [***].

      Methods: [***] plants using clean systems for shipment to [***] in accordance with international regulations.

      I.D.ii. Objective 2: Investigate [***] in [***] of lines potentially useful in breeding, including hybrids.

      Methods: Evaluate the [***] capacity of breeding line candidates in response to standard or improved [***] techniques.

      I.D.iii. Objective 3: Develop estimates of time and cost required to [***] plants in [***] based systems.

      Methods: Conduct a desk study to compare the costs/benefits and barriers associated with large scale [***] methodology including [***].

I.E.  Goal: Proof of Concept field trials of research findings in target locations.

      I.E.i. Objective 1: Evaluate and optimize propagation techniques under commercially relevant conditions.

      Methods: Use IGER and CERES infrastructure for field trialing methods in the UK and at multiple locations in [***] and elsewhere. These  should expand on research performed at IGER and test genotype by environment interactions, with a focus on potentially commercial  genotypes.

      I.E.ii. Objective 2: Evaluate and optimize germplasm performance in the UK and in multiple [***].

      Methods: Use IGER and CERES infrastructure for field trialing at multiple locations in the UK, [***] and elsewhere. These should expand  on research performed at IGER and test genotype by environment interactions with a focus on potentially commercial genotypes.

II.A.  Rationale:

II.   B. Goal: A complete and documented Miscanthus [***].

Page 4 of 10

Confidential Treatment Requested and the Redacted Material has been separately filed with the Commission

      II.B.i. Objective 1: [***] to [***] in [***].

      Methods: In accordance with international conventions, e.g., the Convention on Biodiversity (CBD), [***] Miscanthus [***] from the  [***] of [***]. Document the phenotype and growing [***], using [***] to accurately record the [***]. [***] to [***] for [***] and  subsequent phenotype documentation.

      II B.ii. Objective 2: Characterize full [***].

      Methods: Document the morphological, physiological and [***] of interest in the [***] using consistent phenotyping nomenclature and  [***] compositional analysis. Develop molecular markers associated with phenotypic traits.

      II.B.iii. Objective 3: Assess relatedness of plants identified as useful parents for hybrids.

      Methods: Use molecular markers developed for traits of interest in combination with germplasm characterization data, particularly [***], to  select parents with desired traits that are also likely to present [***].

      II.B.iv. Objective 4: Develop a dynamic warehouse to store data and develop systems to analyse data and support multidisciplinary  collaborative research.

      Methods: IGER and CERES to consider best options for developing the database. Populate the database with the [***] and [***]  information [***]. As germplasm is characterized, integrate phenotype and marker data and use to facilitate choice of promising [***] lines  as well as inform the preparation needed to ensure [***] (e.g. [***]). As data become available from other components of the collaborative  research, such as field trialing and conversion analysis, it will be added to the database to allow PIs to synergistically design next step  experiments.

II.C.  Goal: Improved Miscanthus hybrids for commercial use.

      II.C.i. Objective: Select improved parents.

      Methods: [***] within [***] using information from molecular markers and composition analysis to shorten and streamline the selection of  parents. Cross between [***] and evaluate hybrids to identify improved parents.

      II.C.ii. Objective: Make crosses of selected [***] lines.

      Methods: Appropriate germplasm will be selected for crossing using the database decision tool. Plants will be [***] to [***] in  glasshouses and [***] made both in the glasshouse and outdoors at IGER, depending on time of year. Improve efficiency of [***] and, for  [***], [***]. Determine [***] — and [***]. Send seed of [***] candidates and [***] to CERES locations for trialing.

      II.C. iii Objective: Selection of superior [***].

      Methods: [***] will be transplanted to field. Important morpho-physiological traits will be recorded over [***] years after which the best  genotypes will be selected, [***] and [***] into rhizomes. The value of early prediction of traits will be assessed. A mass selection  reservoir (MSR) will be maintained as a safety net and to contain interesting genotypes that do not justify commercial development.

      II.C.iv. Objective: Field evaluation of hybrids.

      Methods: From rhizomes taken in iii, replicated trials will be established. After [***] (or [***]) years, the best genotypes will be provided to  CERES to test at diverse locations for commercially relevant evaluation.

      II D. Goal: Improved Miscanthus Varieties.

      II.D.i. Objective: Explore new methods of breeding.

      Methods: Set up and test [***] in terms of [***] and [***]. Set up and test [***] in terms of [***] and [***] to determine whether [***]  will be acceptable. The results will guide applications for the setting up of Plant Breeders' Rights schemes.

18.  SPECIAL CONDITIONS:

  18.1  VARIETY RELEASE

    18.1.1 "RELEASE DATE" shall mean the date that CERES determines that a variety developed, tested and evaluated pursuant to the terms  of this SCHEDULE is ready for release, wherein upon such decision, such variety will be formally released by IGER and CERES jointly (if  the variety constitutes JOINT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY) or by IGER (if the variety constitutes IGER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY) or  by CERES (if the variety constitutes CERES INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY).

      18.1.2 For the purposes of this SCHEDULE, CERES, on advice of the breeder(s) of each variety via the MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE,  shall establish, in its sole discretion, an appropriate RELEASE DATE for such varieties.

    18.1.3 At or about the RELEASE DATE for a variety, CERES will determine a COMMERCIAL NAME for such variety under which the seed  of the same will be marketed and sold. "COMMERCIAL NAME" means the complete, preferred name of a released variety under which it  will be marketed and sold.

    18.1.4 The Parties agree that the development of new varieties will not always result in varieties that are commercially acceptable or  releasable. Provided all Parties execute their respective obligations under this SCHEDULE in an appropriate and reasonable manner, no one  Party shall be liable to the other for any refund or other recompense because no commercially acceptable new variety is produced.

  18.2  BBSRC project: Optimizing the development of the energy grass Miscanthus through manipulation of the flowering time.

      Reference to this project ("BBSRC grant") is included in EXHIBIT E to the CA.

      The RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PLAN in Attachment A hereto refers to certain activities to be conducted by IGER pursuant to the  BBSRC grant. The Parties expressly acknowledge and agree that:







IN WITNESS THEREOF this SCHEDULE has been executed on the date hereinbefore entered.

Assess phenotype  trial (planted at  IGER in April  [***]) for  morphological  and physiological  [***] relevant  [***]. Include  [***], [***] status  etc in [***].



Record  important  morphometric  characters  including  winter [***],  spring [***],  [***] to [***]  spring [***]  and summer  [***] (incl  [***]), [***]/  [***], [***]  and intensity,  [***] and  [***], [***],  [***], [***]  and [***],  visual  assessment of  [***]

Scoring  systems need  to be  transferable.  Bar code  reading  needs to be  investigated.



This is the  [***] year  following  [***] so  the mature phenotype  is ready  for the 20 [***]  season. It  should be  repeated  in 20[***]  to check  the impact  of [***] in  [***]

Attachment B — Budget

This Budget is agreed upon for contract years 1 through 3. A contract year ("Year") is April 1 — March 31, starting April 1, 2007. CERES agrees to  provide funding for IGER's RESEARCH PROJECT activities covered by this SCHEDULE in accordance with Article 1.8 of the CA as set forth in the  Budget in page 1 of this Attachment B, taking into account what is provided hereinafter. Pay Costs, Other Recurrent and Other Costs are as in the  Budget. Overhead Costs will be payable as follows:

Page 2

Confidential Treatment Requested and the Redacted Material has been separately filed with the Commission

  -    Each contract year CERES will pay [***]% of the overheads asked, (e.g. of the [***] pounds in Year 1), for the expected reasonable  performance in the various aspects of the program Year by Year and especially for all the items listed in the attached document. This  [***]% amounts to [***] pounds in contract Year 1.

  -    Furthermore, CERES will pay for Year 1 an additional [***]% of the asked overhead ( i.e.[***]% in total of the asked overhead) for full  completion of the Year 1 items A and B listed hereinafter. This additional [***]% equals [***] pounds.

  -    For Year 2 CERES will pay an additional [***]% of the overhead costs asked for full and successful completion of Year 2 items A and C  hereinafter.

  -    For Year 3 CERES will pay an additional [***]% of the overhead costs asked for full and successful completion of Year 3 items A, B, C  and D listed hereinafter.

  -    The MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE will bring forth recommendations to the Parties at the beginning of each Year for the items that IGER  should satisfy to obtain extra overheads, outlined in the framework above.

  -    Assessment on achievements of the nominated items will be made at the end of each Year by the MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE and  recommendations made to the Parties. Upon agreement, CERES will respond to an invoice from IGER as agreed. Should some items in a  section not be achieved then the amount paid will be reduced on a pro-rata basis on the number of items in the section.       CERES-IGER SCHEDULE 1   April 1, 2007
