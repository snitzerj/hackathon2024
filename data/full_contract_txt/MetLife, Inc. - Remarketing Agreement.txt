Ladies and Gentlemen:

This Remarketing Agreement is dated as of August 26, 2014 (this "Remarketing Agreement"), among MetLife, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. ("Deutsche Bank") (the "Remarketing Agents," which expression shall include any institution appointed as a Remarketing Agent in accordance with Section 8 hereof), and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, not individually but solely as Stock Purchase Contract Agent (as defined below) and as attorney-in-fact of the holders of Stock Purchase Contracts (as defined below). The Company and the Remarketing Agents will enter into a Pricing Agreement, to be dated the Remarketing Date (as defined below) (the "Pricing Agreement"), which will set forth, inter alia, the final terms of the Remarketed Securities (as defined below) and the Remarketing Fee (as defined below). The Remarketing Agents are undertaking to remarket Series E Senior Component Debentures, Tranche 1, due 2018 (principal amount $1,000 per Series E Senior Component Debenture) (the "First Tranche Series E Debt Securities") and Series E Senior Component Debentures, Tranche 2, due 2045 (principal amount $1,000 per Series E Senior Component Debenture) (the "Second Tranche Series E Debt Securities"), whose terms will each be modified in the event of a Successful Remarketing (as defined below), as provided in the notice of remarketing from the Company, dated August 26, 2014 (the "Notice") pursuant to Section 3.3(a) of the Twenty-Second Supplemental Indenture (as defined below) and Section 5.2(a)(iv) of the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement (as defined below) (such securities, as so modified from and after a Successful Remarketing (whether or not such securities were remarketed by the Remarketing Agents), the "Securities"). Upon a Successful Remarketing, the Stated Maturity (as defined in the Indenture (as defined below)) of the First Tranche Series E Debt Securities will, effective October 8, 2014, automatically be adjusted to December 15, 2017 and the Stated Maturity of the Second Tranche Series E Debt Securities will, effective October 8, 2014, automatically be adjusted to December 15, 2044.





The First Tranche Series E Debt Securities and Second Tranche Series E Debt Securities will be component securities of the Series E Senior Debentures due 2045 ("Series E Debt Securities") issued by the Company, pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of November 9, 2001 (the "Base Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (as successor in interest to J.P. Morgan Trust Company, National Association (as successor to Bank One Trust Company, N.A.)), as trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by the Twenty- Second Supplemental Indenture, dated as of November 1, 2010 (the "Twenty-Second Supplemental Indenture" and, together with the Base Indenture, the "Indenture"), between the Company and the Trustee. Effective on September 15, 2014, the Series E Debt Securities will automatically convert, without any act of any holder, into units consisting of two tranches, with each $2,000 principal amount of Series E Debt Securities thereafter consisting of $1,000 principal amount of First Tranche Series E Debt Securities and $1,000 principal amount of Second Tranche Series E Debt Securities.

A 1/40t h or 2.50% undivided beneficial ownership interest in each Series E Debt Security having a principal amount of $1,000 is part of a common equity unit (each, a "Unit"), which currently includes one stock purchase contract (the "Stock Purchase Contract") which was issued pursuant to the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement, dated as of November 1, 2010, as amended and supplemented by Supplemental Agreement No. 1, dated June 26, 2013, between the Company and the Stock Purchase Contract Agent (as so amended and supplemented, the "Stock Purchase Contract Agreement"), between the Company and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as stock purchase contract agent (the "Stock Purchase Contract Agent"), and under which the holder of the Unit is obligated to purchase from the Company on the Third Stock Purchase Date (as defined in the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement), for $25.00 per Stock Purchase Contract, a number of shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the "Common Stock"), equal to the applicable Settlement Rate as set forth in the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement. The ownership interests in the Series E Debt Securities or, if the holder has stripped such Unit, designated zero-coupon U.S. Treasury Securities, have been pledged to secure the obligations to purchase Common Stock on the Third Stock Purchase Date (as defined in the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement) pursuant to the Stock Purchase Contract. The terms and conditions of such pledge are set forth in the Pledge Agreement, dated as of November 1, 2010 (the "Pledge Agreement"), among the Company, Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as collateral agent (the "Collateral Agent"), custodial agent (the "Custodial Agent") and securities intermediary (the "Securities Intermediary"), and the Stock Purchase Contract Agent.

The Units were initially issued in a private placement to AM Holdings LLC (f/k/a ALICO Holdings LLC), a Delaware limited liability company (the "Selling Securityholder"), as part of the consideration paid by the Company to the Selling Securityholder in connection with the Company's acquisition of American Life Insurance Company and Delaware American Life Insurance Company from the Selling   2





Securityholder and American International Group, Inc. (the "Acquisition"). The Acquisition was completed on November 1, 2010. The Units were offered and sold by the Selling Securityholder in a registered public offering completed on March 8, 2011.

(c) On the Remarketing Date, the Remarketing Agents shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to remarket the Remarketed Securities tendered or deemed tendered for purchase, at a price which results in cash proceeds equal to at least the sum of (i) the remarketing fee to be paid to the Remarketing Agents in connection with the Remarketing in an amount to be specified in the Pricing Agreement (such fee, the "Remarketing Fee"), (ii) 100% of the aggregate principal amount of such Remarketed Securities, (iii) the accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the Initial Scheduled Third Stock Purchase Date on such Remarketed Securities and (iv) the product of five basis points (0.05%) and the aggregate principal amount of such Remarketed Securities (such sum, the "Remarketing Price").

other than reasonable costs of investigation, unless (i) the indemnifying party and such indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the contrary, (ii) the indemnifying party has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party or (iii) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and such indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying party be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same allegations or circumstances.

(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 6 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, other than due to the express provisions thereof, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Remarketing Agents on the other from the Remarketing of the Remarketed Securities to which any such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Remarketing Agents of the applicable Securities on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Remarketing Agents on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total Remarketing Fee received by the Remarketing Agents, as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Final Prospectus.   27





The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Remarketing Agents on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Remarketing Agents agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Remarketing Agents were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Remarketing Agent shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the applicable Securities remarketed by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Remarketing Agent has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Remarketing Agents in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective obligations with respect to such Remarketed Securities and not joint.

(e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 6 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Remarketing Agent within the meaning of the Act. The obligations of the Remarketing Agents under this Section 6 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Remarketing Agent may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company (including any person who, with his consent, is named in the Registration Statement as about to become a director of the Company) and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.

7. Resignation and Removal of the Remarketing Agents. A Remarketing Agent may resign and be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder, and the Company may remove any or all of the Remarketing Agents, by giving five (5) Business Days' prior written notice to the Stock Purchase Contract Agent and, in the case of a removal, to the Remarketing Agents; provided that no such resignation nor any removal of all the Remarketing Agents shall become effective until the Company shall have appointed at least one nationally recognized broker-dealer as successor to the Remarketing Agents, and such successor Remarketing Agent shall have entered into a   28





letter substantially in the form of Annex III hereof with the Company and the Stock Purchase Contract Agent in which it shall have agreed to conduct the Remarketing in accordance with the Remarketing Procedures. The provisions of this Section 7 shall survive the resignation or removal of the Remarketing Agents pursuant to this Remarketing Agreement.

8. New Remarketing Agents. The Company may appoint any institution or institutions as new Remarketing Agent(s) hereunder (each a "New Remarketing Agent") in respect of the Remarketing in which event, upon the confirmation by such institution through a letter to the Company and the Stock Purchase Contract Agent confirming acceptance of such nomination by the New Remarketing Agent substantially in the form of Annex III hereof, such New Remarketing Agent shall become a party hereto, unless otherwise provided for herein, with all the authority, rights, powers, duties and obligations as if originally named as Remarketing Agent hereunder. The Company will notify the Remarketing Agent(s) appointed in respect of the Remarketing of the Remarketed Securities and the Stock Purchase Contract Agent of a change in the identity of other Remarketing Agents appointed or who have resigned in respect of the Remarketing of the Remarketed Securities generally as soon as reasonably practicable.

9. Offering Restrictions. Each Remarketing Agent acknowledges, represents and agrees and each additional Remarketing Agent appointed pursuant to Section 8 of this Remarketing Agreement will be required to acknowledge, represent and agree that it has not remarketed or delivered and it will not remarket or deliver, any of the Remarketed Securities, in or from any jurisdiction except under circumstances that are reasonably designed to result in compliance with the applicable securities laws and regulations thereof. In particular, each Remarketing Agent acknowledges, represents and agrees and each additional Remarketing Agent appointed pursuant to Section 8 of this Remarketing Agreement will be required to acknowledge, represent and agree as set forth in Annex V to this Remarketing Agreement.

10. Dealing in the Remarketed Securities. Each Remarketing Agent, when acting hereunder, or when acting in its individual or any other capacity, may, to the extent permitted by law, buy, sell, hold or deal in any of the Remarketed Securities. The Remarketing Agents may exercise any vote or join in any action which any beneficial owner of Remarketed Securities may be entitled to exercise or take pursuant to the Indenture with like effect as if they did not act in any capacity hereunder. The Remarketing Agents, in their individual capacities, either as principal or agent, may also engage in or have an interest in any financial or other transaction with the Company as freely as if they did not act in any capacity hereunder.

11. Termination of Remarketing Agreement. This Remarketing Agreement shall terminate (i) in the event of a Remarketing that is not a Successful Remarketing or (ii) as to any Remarketing Agent who resigns or is removed, on the effective date of the resignation or removal of such Remarketing Agent pursuant to Section 7. In addition, the   29





obligations of the Remarketing Agents may be terminated by them by notice given to the Company prior to 12:00 noon, New York City time on the Remarketing Settlement Date if, prior to that time, any of the applicable conditions precedent to the obligations of the Remarketing Agents described in Section 5 hereof shall have failed to occur.

12. Survival. Notwithstanding any such termination set forth in Section 11 hereof, the obligations set forth in Section 4 hereof shall survive and remain in full force and effect until all amounts payable under said Section 4 shall have been paid in full. In addition, the former Remarketing Agents shall be entitled to the rights and benefits under Section 6 of this Remarketing Agreement notwithstanding the replacement or resignation of the Remarketing Agents. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Remarketing Agents, as set forth in this Remarketing Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Remarketing Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Remarketing Agent or any controlling person of any Remarketing Agent, the Company or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.

13. Notices. All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if mailed or transmitted by any standard form of telecommunication; notices to the Remarketing Agents shall be directed to Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., 60 Wall Street, New York, NY 10005, with a copy to Debevoise & Plimpton LLP, 919 Third Avenue, New York, New York 10022, attention of Peter J.

18. Counterparts. This Remarketing Agreement and the Pricing Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto and thereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.

20. Entire Agreement. This Remarketing Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) between the Company and the Remarketing Agents, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof.

21. Waiver of Jury Trial.
