Joint Venture Company shall not, and shall cause each SPV and each of their Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, market or sell any Loop-branded Products or any Products produced using Licensed Subject Matter to any person or entity except to Authorized Customers pursuant to a Transferred Contract (the "Marketing and Sale Restriction"); provided that if at any time during the term of this Agreement, Loop has delivered Proposed Contract Notices that result in Transferred Contracts having binding purchase and supply obligations for less than [***] of the then existing actual production capacity of a Licensed Facility (taking into account Joint Venture Company's reasonable forecasts based on customer requirements, seasonal variations, and other factors) in the subsequent three months (the "[***]"), Joint Venture Company may market and solicit orders for Licensed Products produced in such Licensed Facility directly to customers and potential customers and enter into supply contracts for the sale of Loop-branded Products or any Products produced using Licensed Subject Matter produced in such Licensed Facility with customers without being restricted by the Marketing and Sale Restriction. If at any subsequent time during the term of this Agreement Loop gives Joint Venture Party written notice that Loop is then capable of meeting, and is prepared to meet, the [***] and provides reasonable supporting information and documentation to Joint Venture Party with such notice, then at a date selected by Joint Venture Company that is within ninety (90) days after Joint Venture Company receives such written notice, the Market and Sale Restriction and the other provisions of this Section 2.7 shall go back into force. Nothing in this Section 2.7 shall relieve Loop of any of its obligations under this Agreement. ARTICLE 3 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY 3.1 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

JOINT VENTURE COMPANY SHALL NOT HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO ANY LOOP PARTY WITH RESPECT TO ANY ELIGIBLE CONTRACT THAT DOES NOT BECOME A TRANSFERRED CONTRACT AS PROVIDED IN SECTION 2.3. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, NONE OF THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 3.1 SHALL BE AVAILABLE TO EITHER PARTY WITH RESPECT TO A BREACH OF SECTION 4, CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, OR FOR CLAIMS TO THE EXTENT THEY ARISE OUT OF A PARTY'S GROSS NEGLIGENCE, FRAUD, OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT.
