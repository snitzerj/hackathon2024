Oxbow and Global each may be referred to from time to time herein as a "Party" and collectively as the "Parties".    RECITALS    WHEREAS, Oxbow is a world leader in petroleum coke trading, marketing, sales, and shipping; and    WHEREAS, Global Energy is a world leader in petroleum coke gasification, having optimized operations of the leading petroleum coke gasification technology, EGASâ„¢ technology, at its Wabash gasification facility in Indiana; and    WHEREAS, Oxbow leases a marine terminal site in Texas City, Texas which it believes to be well-suited for installation of petroleum coke gasification technology, in that gasification would optimize Oxbow's flexibility in the sale and use of petroleum coke currently stored on the site, which could be converted into pipeline SNG or hydrogen, as well as being shipped onward to Oxbow's traditional petroleum coke customers; and    WHEREAS, Global Energy is a leader in the development and permitting of gasification facilities, and currently is the only gasification facility owner/operator with permits to construct new gasification facilities (specifically, its Lima and Westfield Projects); and    WHEREAS, the Parties believe that an alliance as described in this Agreement will prove mutually beneficial;    NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows:    AGREEMENT    1.

The Closing shall be deemed effective as of 12:01 a.m. U.S. Eastern Standard Time, on the Closing Date.    2. Strategic Alliance. The Parties hereby form a strategic alliance having the following key elements:    (a) Preferred Suppliers. Oxbow and Global Energy hereby designate one another as their preferred suppliers of certain goods and services, as follows:    (i) Oxbow shall be the preferred petroleum coke supplier to petroleum coke gasification projects owned or controlled by Global Energy.    (ii) Oxbow shall be a preferred supplier of coal, coal fines, gob or waste coal products (collectively, "Coal") to gasification projects owned or controlled by Global Energy.    (iii) Global Energy shall be the preferred gasification technology supplier to petroleum coke gasification projects majority owned or controlled by Oxbow.    (iv) Global Energy shall be the preferred gasification project operator for petroleum coke gasification projects at sites majority owned or controlled by Oxbow.      2





    (b) Further Cooperation. The Parties also agree to cooperate in good faith as follows in furtherance of their strategic alliance:    (i) Oxbow will identify Oxbow petroleum coke related sites for collaboration with Global Energy.    (ii) Global Energy will identify Global Energy petroleum coke related sites for collaboration with Oxbow.    The obligations of the Parties pursuant to this Section 2 are subject to continued demonstrated performance and their mutual agreement on the schedule, pricing, financing, economics and other terms and conditions applicable to any such project.    3. Lima Project. In addition to the strategic alliance described in Section 2 of this Agreement, the parties specifically agree to the following with respect to Global Energy's proposed Lima, Ohio gasification project (the "Lima Project"):    (a) Investment by Oxbow. Oxbow will make a investment (the "Lima Investment") in the company which owns the Lima Project (the "Lima Project Company") in the amount of [*], as consideration for obtaining the fuel supply management agreement for the Lima Project and the other revenues and benefits described in this Section 3. Oxbow's obligation to make this investment would be subject to:    (i) Oxbow obtaining the consent of its existing lenders; and    (ii) Global Energy securing one or more firm written commitments in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Oxbow for at least Two Hundred Seventeen Million and No/100 Dollars ($217,000,000.00) of equity funding for the Lima Project, or in the alternative, evidence demonstrating that Global has available cash of Two Hundred Seventeen Million and No/100 Dollars ($217,000,000.00) in its account.    (iii) Global Energy providing evidence satisfactory to Oxbow in its reasonable discretion that it has secured the right to purchase the site for the Lima Project from the City of Lima, Ohio for a purchase price of One Million Five Hundred Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($1,500,000.00).    (b) Revenues and Benefits to Oxbow. If Oxbow makes the Lima Investment:    (i) Oxbow will receive four percent (4%) of the Lima Project's pre-tax project cash flow after debt service and operation and maintenance ("O&M") expenses. The Lima Project Company's obligation to make such payment would be subject to satisfaction of the same lender covenants which will apply to distributions to equity investors in the Lima Project; and      3





    (ii) Oxbow will receive two percent (2%) of those non-O&M revenues of Global Energy's affiliate, Gasification Engineering Corporation, Inc. ("GEC") related to the Lima Project (e.g., any of the $200 million EPC reserves/construction contingency which is not spent).    (iii) Oxbow will have a seat on the Board of Directors of GEC or any subsidiary or affiliate of GEC which is responsible for the engineering, procurement and construction ("EPC") contract for the Lima Project.    (c) Fuel Management and Supply Agreement. In addition, if Oxbow makes the Lima Investment, Oxbow and Global Energy will enter into a fuel management and supply agreement (the "Fuel Management and Supply Agreement") for all fuel to be utilized by the Lima Project, which would include the following material provisions:    (i) Oxbow will manage all fuel coke and Coal supply and logistics for the Lima Project.    (ii) Oxbow will be paid a management fee of One Million and No/100 Dollars ($1,000,000.00) per year, such fee to be paid irrespective of actual Coal or petroleum coke use by the Lima Project.    (iii) As fuel supply manager, Oxbow will receive a base commission of $0.12 per MMBTU consumed by the Lima Project, independent of fuel type (the "Base Commission"). As an incentive to obtain the lowest cost of fuel throughout the life of the Lima Project, the Lima Project Company would receive two-thirds (2/3) of any cost savings below $1.07 per MMBTU delivered to the project (such price, the "Price Basis"), escalated each year beginning in 2009 in accordance with increases in the Consumer Price Index, and Oxbow would receive one- third (1/3) of any such cost savings. Should the price of fuel delivered to the Lima Project be above the Price Basis, the commission will be reduced on a sliding scale according to the following formula:    C= BC+(PB-PI)*0.1094    Where:    C = commission  BC = Base Commission  PI = price invoiced per MMBTU  PB = Price Basis per MMBTU    However, the commission will never be less than $0.05 per MMBTU regardless of fuel price. For purposes of calculating this commission, the price of all fuel supply transactions would be based on the direct cost of supply and transportation expenses as invoiced.      4





    (iv) Global Energy may provide up to ten percent (10%) of the annual fuel requirements of the Lima Project from renewable sources. Oxbow would receive the same commission on a per-BTU basis on any such fuel supplied by Global Energy.    (d) Project Management. In the event Oxbow funds its investment in the Lima Project Company as set forth in Section 3(a), and either or both of the following occur:       (i)  Closing and funding of the Lima Project financing does not occur on or before December 15, 2007; or       (ii)  There is a delay of twelve months or more in meeting any project milestones as set forth in Schedule 3(d) ("Project Milestones");    then Oxbow shall have the right to take over the development and management of the Lima Project; provided, however, that the Lima Project fuel supply arrangements shall continue to be managed as set forth in the Fuel Management and Supply Agreement and Oxbow shall not be entitled to direct the disposition of ownership interests in the Lima Project Company, unless additional equity is required to finance the project. Further, if Oxbow elects to take over the development and management of the Lima Project and Oxbow subsequently determines that it does not desire to continue to participate in the Lima Project, it may withdraw from further participation, relinquish its economic interests in the Lima Project Company and GEC and terminate the Fuel Management and Supply Agreement, without further liability or obligation to Global Energy and/or the other Lima Project participants.    4.
