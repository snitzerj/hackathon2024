Except as would not have a Material Adverse Effect, all leases to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party are valid and binding and  no default by the Company or any of its subsidiaries has occurred and is continuing thereunder, and, to the Company's knowledge, no material  defaults by the landlord are existing under any such lease.

Such disclosure controls and procedures (a) are designed to provide reasonable assurance that  material information relating to the Company and its subsidiaries is made known to the Company's Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial  Officer by others within those entities. Such disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide such reasonable assurance.

information specified in Section 2(c)). The foregoing indemnity agreement is in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have to  the Remarketing Agent or to any officer, employee or controlling person of the Remarketing Agent.

(b) The Remarketing Agent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its officers, and employees and each of its directors, the Trust and  each Trustee and each person, if any, who controls any of the Issuers within the meaning of the Securities Act, from and against any loss, claim,  damage or liability, joint or several, or any action in respect thereof, to which the Company, any such director, officer or employee, the Trust or any  such Trustee or any such controlling person may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such loss, claim, damage,  liability or action arises out of, or is based upon:

(i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus,  any free writing prospectus that the Company has filed or is required to file with the Commission pursuant to Rule 433(d) of the Securities  Act, or the Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto, or in any Blue Sky Application; or

(ii) the omission or alleged omission to state in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any free writing prospectus that the  Company has filed or is required to file with the Commission pursuant to Rule 433(d) of the Securities Act, or Prospectus or in any  amendment or supplement thereto, or in any Blue Sky Application, any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the  statements therein (and with respect to the Time of Sale Prospectus, the Prospectus or any such free writing prospectus, in the light of the  circumstances under which such statements are made) not misleading;

but in each case only to the extent that the untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance  upon and in conformity with the written information furnished to the Issuers by or on behalf of the Remarketing Agent specifically for inclusion  therein (which consists of the information specified in Section 2(c)), and shall reimburse the Company and any such director, officer or employee,  the Trust or any such Trustee or such controlling person promptly upon demand for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the  Company or any such director, officer or employee, the Trust or any Trustee or any such controlling person in connection with investigating or  defending or preparing to defend against any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred. The foregoing indemnity  agreement is in addition to any liability which the Remarketing Agent may otherwise have to the Company or any such director, officer or  employee, the Trust or any such Trustee or any such controlling person.

(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 7 of notice of any claim or the commencement of any action, the indemnified  party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 7, notify the indemnifying party in writing  of the claim or the commencement of that action; provided however, that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any  liability which it may have under this Section 7 except to the extent it has been materially prejudiced by such failure and, provided further, that the  failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not

23







relieve it from any liability which it may have to an indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 7. If any such claim or action shall be  brought against an indemnified party, and it shall notify the indemnifying party thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate  therein and, to the extent that it wishes, jointly with any other similarly notified indemnifying party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel  satisfactory to the indemnified party. After notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to assume the defense of  such claim or action, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to the indemnified party under this Section 7 for any legal or other expenses  subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; provided  however, the Remarketing Agent shall have the right to employ separate counsel to represent the Remarketing Agent and its respective officers,  employees and controlling persons who may be subject to liability arising out of any claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought by the  Remarketing Agent against the Company under this Section 7 if, in the reasonable judgment of counsel to the Remarketing Agent it is advisable  for the Remarketing Agent, its officers, employees and controlling persons to be jointly represented by separate counsel, due to the availability of  one or more legal defenses to them which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, and in that event the  reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be paid by the Company; provided further, that the Company shall not be liable for  the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to one local counsel in each relevant jurisdiction) at any time for all  such indemnified parties. No indemnifying party shall:

(i) without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), settle or compromise or  consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which  indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim  or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising  out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding, or

(ii) be liable for any settlement of any such action effected without its written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld),  but if settled with its written consent or if there be a final judgment of the plaintiff in any such action, the indemnifying party agrees to  indemnify and hold harmless any indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.

(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 7 shall for any reason be unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party  under Section 7(a), 7(b) or 7(c) in respect of any loss, claim, damage or liability, or any action in respect thereof, referred to therein, other than to  the extent that such indemnification is unavailable or insufficient due to a failure to provide prompt notice in accordance with Section 7(c), then  each indemnifying party shall, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party  as a result of such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof:

24







(i) in such proportion as shall be appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Issuers on the one hand and the Remarketing  Agent on the other hand from the Remarketing; or

(ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Issuers on the one hand and the Remarketing Agent on the  other with respect to the statements or omissions or alleged statements or alleged omissions which resulted in such loss, claim, damage or  liability (or action in respect thereof) as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.

The relative benefits received by the Issuers, on the one hand, and the Remarketing Agent, on the other, with respect to such offering shall be  deemed to be in the same proportion as the aggregate Accreted Value of the Remarketing Securities as of the end of day on the day next preceding  the Remarketing Settlement Date less the fee paid to the Remarketing Agent pursuant to Section 4(a) and less the expenses paid by the Company  pursuant to Section 4(b), on the one hand, and the total fees received by the Remarketing Agent pursuant to such Section 4(a), plus the expenses  paid by the Company pursuant to Section 4(b), on the other hand, bear to such aggregate Accreted Value of the Remarketing Securities. The  relative fault shall be determined by reference to whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission  to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Issuers on the one hand or the Remarketing Agent on the other hand, the intent of the  parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and  the Remarketing Agent agree that it would not be just and equitable if the amount of contributions pursuant to this Section 7(d) were to be  determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to  herein. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, referred to  above in this Section 7(d) shall be deemed to include, for purposes of this Section 7(d), any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such  indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7(d), the  Remarketing Agent shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the total price at which Remarketing Securities distributed in the  Remarketing exceed the amount of any damages which the Remarketing Agent has otherwise paid or become liable to pay by reason of any untrue  or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f)  of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

Section 8. [Reserved]

Section 9. Dealing in the Remarketing Securities. The Remarketing Agent, when acting as a Remarketing Agent or in its individual or any other  capacity, may, to the extent permitted by law, buy, sell, hold and deal in any of the Remarketing Securities. The Remarketing Agent may to the  extent permitted by law exercise any vote or join in any action which any beneficial owner of Remarketing Securities

25







may be entitled to exercise or take pursuant to the Trust Agreement or the Indenture with like effect as if it did not act in any capacity hereunder.  The Remarketing Agent, in its individual capacity, either as principal or agent, may, to the extent permitted by law, also engage in or have an  interest in any financial or other transaction with the Issuers as freely as if it did not act in any capacity hereunder.

Section 10. Remarketing Agent's Performance; Duty of Care. The duties and obligations of the Remarketing Agent shall be determined solely by  the express provisions of this Agreement, the Trust Agreement and the Indenture. No implied covenants or obligations of or against the  Remarketing Agent shall be read into this Agreement, the Trust Agreement or the Indenture. In the absence of bad faith on the part of the  Remarketing Agent, the Remarketing Agent may conclusively rely upon any document furnished to it, which purports to conform to the  requirements of this Agreement, the Trust Agreement or the Indenture as to the truth of the statements expressed in any of such documents. The  Remarketing Agent shall be protected in acting upon any document or communication reasonably believed by it to have been signed, presented or  made by the proper party or parties. The Remarketing Agent, acting under this Agreement, shall incur no liability to the Company or to any holder  of Remarketing Securities in its individual capacity or as Remarketing Agent for any action or failure to act, on its part in connection with a  Remarketing or otherwise, except if such liability is judicially determined to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct on its  part. The Remarketing Agent will be entitled to rely conclusively on any determination by the Calculation Agent under the Calculation Agency  Agreement, dated as of December 18, 2001 between the Company and Reinsel & Company LLP, as Calculation Agent, of the Accreted Value or  Discount relating to the Preferred Securities and Debentures, as applicable, and will incur no liability to the Company or any holder of Remarketing  Securities relating to inaccuracies in calculating such Accreted Value or Discount.

Section 11. Termination. This Agreement shall terminate (i) the Business Day immediately following the Remarketing Settlement Date, (ii) at 5:00  p.m., New York City time, on the last date of the Remarketing if the Remarketing is not successful or (iii) on the effective date of the resignation or  removal of the Remarketing Agent and the appointment of a new Remarketing Agent. In addition, the obligations of the Remarketing Agent  hereunder may be terminated by it by notice given to the Company prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the date immediately preceding the  Commencement Date if, prior to that time, any of the events described in Sections 6(i), (j) or (k) shall have occurred.

If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to any of the provisions hereof, except as otherwise provided herein, the Company shall not be under any  liability to the Remarketing Agent and the Remarketing Agent shall not be under any liability to the Company, except that:

(x) if this Agreement is terminated by the Remarketing Agent because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms  or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, the Company will reimburse the Remarketing Agent

26







for all of its out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of its counsel) reasonably incurred by it; and

(y) if the Remarketing Agent failed or refused to perform its obligations hereunder, without some reason sufficient hereunder to justify the  cancellation or termination of its obligations hereunder, the Remarketing Agent shall not be relieved of liability to the Company for damages  occasioned by its default and shall not be entitled to be reimbursed for any expense.

The respective indemnities, representations, warranties and agreements of the Issuers and the Remarketing Agent contained  in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall survive the Remarketing and shall remain in full  force and effect, regardless of any termination or cancellation of this Agreement or any investigation made by or on behalf of any of them or any  person controlling any of them.

Section 17. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts and, if executed in more than one counterpart, the  executed counterparts shall each be deemed to be an original but all such counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.

Section 18. Headings; Interpretation. The headings herein are inserted for convenience of reference only and are not intended to be part of, or to  affect the meaning or interpretation of, this Agreement.

Section 19. Amendment; Intention of Parties. This Agreement may be amended by any written instrument (including by an amendment and  restatement hereof) at any time after the date hereof by the parties hereto.

The Company acknowledges and agrees that the Remarketing Agent is acting solely in the capacity of an arm's length contractual counterparty to  the Company with respect to the Remarketing contemplated hereby (including in connection with determining the terms of the Remarketing) and  not as a financial advisor or a fiduciary to, or an agent of, the Company or any other person. Additionally, the Remarketing Agent is not advising  the Company or any other person as to any legal, tax, investment, accounting or regulatory matters in any jurisdiction.

28







contemplated hereby or other matters relating to such transactions will be performed solely for the benefit of the Remarketing Agent and shall not  be on behalf of the Company.
