The parties hereto agree that the granting of any rights, title or interest to   TELKOM in any extension or modification (including TELKOM extensions and   TELKOM modifications) shall not be construed by the parties hereto or any court   of law to mean that SAP AFRICA has granted or given up any rights, title, or   interest in or to SAP AFRICA'S PROPRIETARY INFORMATION or any part   thereof.   8. 5.   TELKOM agrees that it will not modify any third party SOFTWARE provided in   terms of this AGREEMENT, unless expressly authorised in writing by such third   party vendor and SAP AFRICA.



- 23 -  TELKOM CONTRACT No. 076C/01   8. 6.

It is recorded that, unless the parties should agree otherwise,   such remote access shall be by a dial - up facility only.   9. 2     The Maintenance Services to be provided by SAP AFRICA shall not include any   services other than those contemplated in clause 9. 1 and those set out in



- 24 -                                             TELKOM CONTRACT No. 076C/01   annexure 2. Maintenance Services will be offered only for the current VERSION   and RELEASE and the immediately preceding VERSION and RELEASE. SAP   AFRICA shall use its best endeavours to provide Maintenance Services in   respect of earlier VERSIONS and/or RELEASES provided that should SAP   AFRICA and its licensors incur material costs in supporting such prior   RELEASES and/or VERSIONS, then the parties shall negotiate with each other,   observing the principles of good faith, to agree upon additional maintenance fees   payable by TELKOM in respect of such prior RELEASES and/or VERSIONS.   9. 3    Upon TELKOM'S request and provided that TELKOM has paid the Maintenance   Fee due to SAP AFRICA, SAP AFRICA shall, deliver new RELEASES and   VERSIONS and related DOCUMENTATION to the DESIGNATED SITES at no *   extra cost to TELKOM. Maintenance Service does not include the delivery of any   SOFTWARE and DOCUMENTATION that SAP AFRICA offers as separate   products and/or which have not been licensed in terms of this AGREEMENT.   9. 4      All other maintenance, consulting or related services not referred to in this clause 9   and/or in annexure 2, shall be agreed upon separately in writing and shall be   subject to agreed additional charges.   Maintenance Fees and Payment   9. 5     As consideration for providing the maintenance services, TELKOM shall pay to   SAP AFRICA an annual fee, that shall be calculated as a percentage of the   agreed License Fee, expressed in USD, for the SOFTWARE as specified in   annexure 1 hereto. Such percentage is stipulated in the annexure 2 hereto   ("the Maintenance Fee"). TELKOM shall pay the Maintenance Fee annually in   advance, in ZAR, calculated at the ruling USD: ZAR rate of exchange on the



- 25 -  TELKOM CONTRACT No. 076C/01   date of invoice and otherwise in accordance with the other terms of payment   set out in this AGREEMENT and annexure 2.   9. 6    SAP AFRICA shall be entitled, upon 3 months written notice, to increase the   Maintenance Fee by increasing the percentage upon which the Maintenance   Fee is calculated or, on another basis provided that any increase to the   Maintenance Fee, caused by a combination of increases arising from:   9. 6. 1       inflation; and/or   9. 6. 2       the percentage at which the Maintenance Fee is calculated; and/or   9. 6. 3       USD/ZAR exchange rate movements,   shall not be greater than the annual increase in the South African   Consumer Price Index for all areas for the immediately preceding year ("the   CPI"), as published by the Central Statistics Agency of South Africa, or its   successors. However, should the Maintenance Fee not be increased by   the full extent of the CPI for any one year then, future increases to the   Maintenance Fee shall not exceed the difference between the actual   increases to the maintenance fee and the cumulative effect of the annual   increases in the CPI, for the immediately preceding thirty six consecutive   months period.   9. 7    The Maintenance Services may be terminated by TELKOM in writing at   any time upon 3 (three) months prior written notice. Subject to any   accrued rights and obligations, SAP AFRICA shall be entitled to   terminate the provision of Maintenance Services in respect of the   SOFTWARE or any modules thereof in the event of:



- 26 -                                             TELKOM CONTRACT No. 076C/01   9. 7. 1           an unremedied material breach of this AGREEMENT by TELKOM;   and/or   9. 7. 2             should SAP AFRICA, SAP AG or their respective licensors, cease, for   whatever reason, providing such Maintenance Services,   provided that in the latter case, SAP AFRICA and /or SAP AG shall procure   that COMMERCE ONE INC.. Inc. shall provide the Maintenance Service   and any related obligations of SAP Africa when providing Maintenance   Service in terms of this AGREEMENT including, its' obligations arising out   of annexure 3 Any Maintenance Fees paid in advance will be refunded to   TELKOM.   9. 8    Wherever in terms of this AGREEMENT, TELKOM is obliged or required   to provide remote access for whatever reason to SAP AFRICA, then   SAP AFRICA and its representatives, shall comply strictly with   TELKOM"S internal policies, arrangements and procedures with regard   thereto.   9. 9    SAP AFRICA shall use its best endeavours to meet and comply with the   projected resolution times set out in annexure 2 hereto.   10.     WARRANTY   10. 1    SAP AFRICA warrants that the SOFTWARE will conform to the functional   specifications contained in the DOCUMENTATION on the date of installation of the   SOFTWARE and will perform, when in use without material alteration on the   DESIGNATED UNIT in accordance with the functional specifications set forth in   the DOCUMENTATION.



- 27 -                                             TELKOM CONTRACT NO. 076C/01   10. 2    SAP AFRICA'S warranty aforesaid is subject to TELKOM providing SAP AFRICA   necessary access, including remote access, to the SOFTWARE and, if necessary,   to the DESIGNATED UNIT and to TELKOM not being in breach of any material   term of this AGREEMENT.   10. 3    TELKOM must specifically identify to SAP AFRICA, the nature of the perceived   SOFTWARE defect and specifically describe the conditions under which the   perceived defect occurs.

- 31 -  TELKOM CONTRACT No. 076C/01   defaulting party or any person or entity in respect of whom the defaulting party may   be vicariously liable. However, it is recorded for the avoidance of doubt that if   TELKOM should suffer a loss of revenue as a consequence of the SOFTWARE   failing to conform or perform to its functional specifications, then SAP AFRICA's   revenue share fee shall be decreased accordingly.   11. 6   It is agreed that each provision of this AGREEMENT that provides for a limitation   of liability, or warranties or exclusion of damages, is intended by the parties to be   severable and independent of any other provision and to be enforced as such.   11. 7     FAILURE OF MARKETPLACE   11. 7. 1      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this AGREEMENT and in   particular, clause 11. 1, in instances where the module of the SOFTWARE   constituting a portion of the Marketplace known as MarketSet 2. 0 Platform, fails   and cannot be accessed or USED by TELKOM and BUSINESS THIRD PARTIES   on the DESIGNATED UNIT and/or such other DESIGNATED UNIT where the   SOFTWARE is installed for disaster recovery or back-up USE, and such failure is   caused solely by a failure in the SOFTWARE to perform in accordance with the   specifications set out in the DOCUMENTATION and should the Marketplace   remain unable to be accessed or USED by TELKOM and/or BUSINESS THIRD   PARTIES for a continuous period of 72 hours, commencing from the time when   such failure is logged as a Priority 1 error (as defined in annexure 2) with SAP   AFRICA as a SOFTWARE problem and SAP AFRICA is unable to provide a   solution or resolution within the said 72 hours, then TELKOM shall be entitled to   terminate this AGREEMENT and claim damages limited as provided for in clause   11. 4.

Such acceptance shall be based on   market norms for the availability levels of Marketset software similar to or the   same as Marketset considered to be mission critical, which can be established via   independent market research, which shall be the responsibility and for the   account of SAP. In the event of a dispute between the parties then clause 22 shall   apply.   12     INDEMNITY   12. 1   SAP AFRICA warrants that SAP AG and its licensors own the SOFTWARE and   CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION licensed by SAP AFRICA hereunder, including   all intellectual property rights therein and that SAP AFRICA has all rights from SAP   AG and its licensors necessary to licence the SOFTWARE and SAP AFRICA'S   CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION to TELKOM in accordance with the terms of this   AGREEMENT,   12. 2   SAP AFRICA makes no representations with regard to the possibility of   infringement by combination use of the SOFTWARE.

The Maintenance Fee shall be calculated at 17% of the License fee stipulated in          annexure 1 for the license of the SOFTWARE.   2.     MAINTENANCE SERVICES   SAP Africa ("SAP") endeavours to provide the highest quality support and to ensure system stability throughout the life cycle of the Software solution. TELKOM will benefit through a lower total cost of ownership and will, in the future, experience an optimal usage of system resources and protection of existing investments.            7 x 24h Support Worldwide   SAP Customer Support delivers help for software problems in a fast and competent manner. SAP provides a 7 x 24h Support availability for messages with 'very high' priority using the 'Follow-the-Sun' model. At any given time of day an expert will be at hand to provide advice.   All Support centres are linked through a unique Support infrastructure, ensuring that all information provided to SAP is on hand regardless where or when.



- 58 -     TELKOM CONTRACT No. 076C/01   Software Maintenance   Software Maintenance includes the further improvement of the software, as well as the continuous adaptation of the software to new database and operating system versions.  Each new release contains solutions to all known software errors.   Delivery of Functional Enhancements and Updates to the R/3 Software   SAP and its Licensors continuously enhance and improve the Software to ensure that Licensees customers always have the latest technology and business functions (e. g. functionality supporting the introduction of the Euro). SAP ensures that customers always receive the latest release of the R/3 software as soon as it becomes available.    Integrated Support for SAP and Partner Products   SAP maintains Collaborative Support Agreements with SAP Partners who have provided Licensees with hardware, operating system and database platforms to ensure seamless support. Should a Licensee request SAP require the involvement of the respective partner, SAP has established interfaces and procedures to do so.    Access to 'SAP's Frontend (formerly: OSS)   SAP'sFrontend is a quick and user-friendly interface for communication between customers and SAP. Features include:   - Access to the Software Support Package repository for downloads   - Database access to individual problem solutions for downloads   - Knowledge Database access to a wealth of information on the use of the Software   - Electronic notification about important information (HotNews)   - Access to SAP's request handling process.   Support Services   The requirement for deriving the full benefit from SAP's Global Support Network is a remote connection from the customer's Software System to SAP's Frontend. This enables the efficient usage of SAP's portfolio of Remote Services and will enable customers to work with the SAP Support experts whenever required and in particular, at the start of their



- 59 -     TELKOM CONTRACT NO. 076C/01   implementation. Also, a remote connection is a prerequisite for 7 x 24h support for priority 1 messages.   Under the TeamSAP Support maintenance agreement, SAP Support deals with problem messages pertaining to:   - An error in the software   - An error in the software causes subsequent errors   - There are problems when implementing corrections   - There is no training or documentation available   - The functions are not logical   - The software ergonomics has flaws   Messages of this nature are responded to in writing via SAP's Frontend.   Any other messages are termed consulting issues and may be processed by either SAP's Remote Consulting department, the customer's implementation consultants or SAP consultants. This service is, however, priced separately and is not within scope of the maintenance agreement. Messages of this nature usually concern:   -  Processing logic of the software, the business processes and customising (questions  regarding working with transactions, programs and screens, the contents of screens  and  pr in touts ,   e tc .   )   - Administration or tuning of the SAP System, of the database or the operating system   - Errors caused by a modification of the system   - A solution is clear from the short text or from the help text of the system error   Maintenance Service Levels   Optimum support with fast reaction times is the cornerstone of SAP's Support organisation. SAP's Support process uses a three-tier Support structure:    Local Support (in 50 countries worldwide)   Local Support Centres at SAP subsidiaries are the local contact points for customers. During usual working hours, the Local Support Centres handle all inquiries relating to support in the language of the respective country and, if necessary, forward them to the



-60-    TELKOM CONTRACT NO. 076C/01    appropriate local partner or the nearest Regional Support Centre. Most inquiries are entered via SAP 's Frontend which offers all the advantages of automatic dispatching.    Regional Support (more than 400 Support professionals in four Regional Support Centres)   Regional Support Centres are located in Walldorf, Germany (Europe/Africa), Philadelphia, USA (Americas), Singapore (Asia-Pacific) and Tokyo, Japan (North East Asia). These Centres are responsible for processing support inquiries and also form part of the 7 x 24h support network. According to the 'FoIlow-the-Sun' principle, inquiries received outside normal working hours are automatically forwarded to the Regional Support Centre that is currently active. Another task is the co-ordination of regional partners in their co-operation with SAP customers.    Development Support (Europe, Americas, Asia)   SAP Africa's Local Support Centre supports all SAP customers in the Southern Africa/Sub- Sahara region. In the event of SAP Africa being unable to respond timeously or effectively, the support query will be elevated to COMMERCE ONE INC.. Inc. consultants, in which event, SAP Africa shall use its best endeavours to respond timeously in accordance with the service levels stipulated in the table below.   The Quality Management processes implemented throughout the SAP Support organisation are certified globally according to the international standard ISO 9002.   The workflow between the support levels is defined in an internal Support Level Agreement (SLA) and SAP's Support Process Monitoring team ensures that requests are forwarded smoothly between the support levels. SAP Africa, SAP AG and their respective licensors shall use their best endeavours and efforts to ensure that the below mentioned Initial Reaction Times and Projected Resolution Times ("PRT") are achieved in 80% of all cases;   Priority   Very High (1)   High (2)   Medium (3)   Low (4)   Initial Reaction Time   (IRT)   30 minutes   2 hours   4 hours   8 hours   Projected Resolution Time   (PRT)   1 day   3 days   7 days   1 4 days   Priority 1: d, h, min = days, hours, minutes in actual time Priority 2, 3, 4: d, h, min = days, hours, minutes during office hours



- 61 -     TELKOM CONTRACT No. 076C/01   The initial reaction time (IRT) is the time elapsed between message receipt at SAP ("Send to SAP" in SAP Service System) and initial contact with the customer or change of the message status.   The Projected Resolution Time (PRT) is the time elapsed between IRT and providing a solution.   Priorities of messages are defined as follows:    Very High or Priority 1   A message with priority "Very high" is justified when critical restrictions in day-to-day operations are encountered. Critical tasks, especially time-critical jobs, cannot be performed, due to a total system shutdown or a malfunction in a main function of the production SAP system.   This message requires immediate processing, as the malfunction can result in serious losses.    High or Priority 2   A message with priority "High" is justified when serious restrictions in day-to-day operations are encountered. Necessary tasks cannot be performed due to a malfunction or failed function in the Software that is urgently required in the current situation.   The message requires rapid processing, because the continuing malfunction could cause a serious interruption in the entire production system.    Medium or Priority 3   A message with priority "Medium" is justified when restrictions in day-to-day operations are encountered. This is caused by a malfunction or failed functionality in the system.    Low or Priority 4   A message with priority "Low" is justified when day-to-day operations are not affected or only affected in a minor fashion. This is caused by a malfunction or failed functionality in the system that is not used daily or is only used rarely.   (Problem situations in test systems will normally result in a priority that is one level lower than the identical problem in a production system).



- 62 -     TELKOM CONTRACT No. 076C/01   On the anniversary of this AGREEMENT, the parties shall enter into discussions and   negotiations for the purposes of reviewing the aforestated maintenance service level terms,   more particularly, the related commercial terms thereof including, the maintenance fee and/or   percentages; the response, processing and resolution times; the penalties that may be   payable by SAP Africa and/or its licensors for failing to comply with such times and other   aspects of the maintenance services. The parties acknowledge that the market for the   SOFTWARE in South Africa is limited and that therefor it may be difficult to ascertain market   conditions for the purposes of reviewing such commercial and related terms. Accordingly,   the parties shall take cognisance of market conditions in other countries where the   SOFTWARE is being used. Should the parties be unable to agree upon any such   amendments within 30 days from the anniversary date, then such dispute shall be referred   for determination by the Arbitration Foundation of Southern Africa ("AFSA") in accordance   with the rules of AFSA and to an arbitrator appointed by the Chairperson of AFSA upon   application by either party. The arbitrator shall upon request of either party, appoint a   suitably qualified expert to assist him in determining the dispute. Except in the case of   manifest error, the arbitrators' ruling shall be final and binding upon the parties but shall be   without prejudice to a party's other rights and obligations arising from the AGREEMENT.



- 6 3 -    TELKOM CONTRACT No. 076C/01     Customer Message Support   The process of customer message support is the interface between development and service. The process steps that impact upon the SLA are customer message recording, preliminary checking, search for relevant error notes (known problem solution), and problem analysis.   Life Cycle of a Customer Message   Refer to accompanying PDF for diagram    Telkom customers can access the SAP's Frontend or SAPNet-Web Frontend and create their own requests and messages. Customer requests and messages that are received in writing via fax (+27 11 2356004) are first processed by the support facility of the Local Support Centre and then recorded for further processing in SAP's internal customer support system. A request or message is automatically assigned to an administrator in the SAP support organization (Local Support and Regional Support for the Software) based on the components assigned to it.   Performing preliminary checks, searching for troubleshooting information   The processor first checks whether the problem report is complete, and whether an entry has already been made in the system containing a solution to the reported problem. This search is conducted semi-automatically in SAP's support system. If an entry is found containing a solution to the problem, then the person who had submitted the problem report is notified in writing via SAPNet and the problem is closed for SAP.   Problem Analysis   If, following preliminary analysis, the Local Support level decides that the problem must be handled by an expert in the respective component, the problem is passed on to the Regional



- 64 -     TELKOM CONTRACT No. 076C/01   Support level. If the problem involves a program error or if the processor cannot find a solution despite intensive analysis, he or she transfers it to the Development Support level. The responsibility for Development Support lies with the user departments of the development areas.   If no relevant error note (known solution) exists, the customer shall provide SAP with sufficient test time and support, as an attempt is made to reproduce the reported problem and to determine whether it is a problem with the software (at SAP or in the customer's system, provided that the latter does not negatively affect the customer's operations). If this reproduction of the problem is not possible, the next time the problem occurs, additional analyses are performed to narrow down the source of the problem. In the meantime, the problem receives the status of "customer action" in the support system. If special handling by an expert is required, then it is relayed to Development Support.   Escalation Management   In the event of SAP's Support Management deciding that the standard support processes are insufficient to solve a critical customer situation (problems as described in point 2 above) a formal escalation process is invoked.   During this process, SAP will assign the required SAP personnel to the customer remotely (via a remote connection) and/or on site, as appropriate. These resources will be under the direct supervision of SAP's management and the customer will not incur any costs.   A formal de-escalation process, involving an assigned Customer Services Manager, will take place once the critical issue has been resolved.   During the implementation phase prior to the SOFTWARE being installed, SAP AFRICA and TELKOM will negotiate with each other to discuss and agree upon an appropriate detailed escalation process for the Maintenance Services that SAP AFRICA and its licensors will provide and that will apply during the said implementation phase and the "go-live" stage. The parties shall also determine an escalation process that is appropriate for TELKOM'S needs and business requirements when USING the SOFTWARE.
