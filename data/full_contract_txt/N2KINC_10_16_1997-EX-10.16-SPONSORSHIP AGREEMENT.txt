                                                                 CONFIDENTIAL Portions of this Exhibit have been omitted pursuant to a request for confidential treatment. The omitted portions, marked by [****], have been separately filed with the Commission.

                           SPONSORSHIP AGREEMENT

This agreement ("Agreement") is entered into as of the 23rd day of September, 1997 ("Effective Date"), by and between Excite, Inc., a California corporation, located at 555 Broadway, Redwood City, California 94063 ("Excite"), and N2K Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation, located at 55 Broad Street, 26th Floor, New York, New York, 10004 ("Sponsor").

                                 RECITALS

A.   Excite maintains a site on the Internet at http://www.excite.com (the      "Excite Site") and owns and/or manages related Web Sites worldwide      (collectively, the "Excite Network") which, among other things, allow users      to search for and access content and other sites on the Internet.

B.   Excite also maintains and/or manages certain Web pages which may be      delivered to users via email, desktop "channels" or Internet "push"      technologies (collectively, "Broadcast Pages") which may incorporate      content supplied to Excite by third parties for the purpose of providing      value to Excite users and providing access to the content, products and/or      services of such third parties.

C.   Sponsor is in the business of distributing certain online retail music      merchandise and related content and maintains a Web site at      http://www.musicblvd.com (the "Sponsor Site") and other Web sites through      which it makes this merchandise and this content available to its users.

D.   Sponsor wishes to be the exclusive retail store music sponsor of the Excite      Site and the Excite Broadcast Pages, to distribute its music-related      content through the Excite Site and the Excite Broadcast Pages and to      promote its online retail music merchandise business to Excite.com users.

Therefore, the parties agree as follows:

1.       EXCLUSIVITY, TERM AND RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL

      a)       Sponsor will be the exclusive retail music store sponsor of                   the Excite Site and the Excite Broadcast Pages. Excite will                   not permit the display of advertising banners, promotional                   buttons, promotional links or other promotional materials for                   any retail sale of Music Products on the Excite Site, except                   those Music Products offered by Sponsor, nor advertising by                   any other Retail Music Store. "Retail Music Store" shall mean                   any entity which is primarily engaged in the sale of Music                   Products at retail to consumers. "Music Products"     2                                                                     CONFIDENTIAL

              shall mean pre-recorded music hard goods, digitally                  distributed music (except live and/or cybercast events), music                  books (to the extent this Agreement does not conflict with                  Excite's existing agreement with Amazon.com), music-related                  t-shirts and apparel, and music videos (except live and/or                  cybercast events).

              Notwithstanding the foregoing, Excite may make available                  opportunities on the Excite Site to purchase Music Products                  from parties other than Sponsor if such Music Products are not                  available from Sponsor so long as, prior to entering into                  arrangements to make available opportunities to purchase Music                  Products from parties other than Sponsor, Excite notifies                  Sponsor of its interest in the Music Products and gives Sponsor                  thirty (30) days to make the desired Music Products available                  through the Sponsor Site. Excite and Sponsor acknowledge that                  certain market opportunities may arise in which the desired                  Music Products must be made available on less than thirty (30)                  days advance notice and will work together in good faith to                  maximize those opportunities. In no event will Excite enter                  into arrangements to make available opportunities to purchase                  Music Products from parties other than Sponsor that would                  prevent Sponsor from being the exclusive source of such Music                  Products on the Excite Site once the Music Products become                  available through Sponsor.

      b)      The term of this Agreement will begin on the Effective Date and                  will end on the second (2nd) anniversary of the Commencement                  Date. The "Commencement Date" means the date on which Excite                  commences delivery of Impressions (defined below). The parties                  anticipate the Commencement Date will be on or about October                  15, 1997.

      c)      The parties' existing agreements regarding sponsorship of the                  WebCrawler Web site (http://webcrawler.com) and all of the                  existing advertising buys on the Excite Network will be                  terminated as of the Commencement Date. Excite will credit                  Sponsor in an amount equal to [****]. This credit will be





              applied to reduce the first year exclusivity fee described in                  Section 7(b) and will be reflected in a reduction of Sponsor's                  December 31, 1997 payment to Excite described in Section 7(e).

      d)      Excite will offer Sponsor the right of first refusal to                  negotiate with Excite for renewal of this sponsorship.

                                    2    3                                                                     CONFIDENTIAL

               i) Excite will not propose, solicit or negotiate offers from                   entities other than Sponsor for any retail music store                   sponsorships of the Excite Site, if at all, until [****] prior                   to the expiration of the term of this Agreement.

               ii) Commencing not later than [****] prior to the expiration                   of the term of the Agreement, Excite will negotiate with                   Sponsor in good faith with respect to the terms and conditions                   under which this Agreement would be renewed. Excite will                   negotiate exclusively with Sponsor for the next [****] in good                   faith effort to negotiate and execute a written sponsorship                   renewal agreement. If, [****] prior to the expiration of the                   term of the Agreement, the parties have not entered into a                   written sponsorship renewal agreement. Excite may enter into                   negotiations with any third party with respect to retail music                   store sponsorships of the Excite Site.

               iii) In the event that Excite intends to enter into an                   agreement with a third party with respect to retail music                   store sponsorships of the Excite Site before the expiration of                   the term of the Agreement, Excite will deliver to Sponsor a                   written notice describing the relevant opportunity. Although                   Excite will not be required to disclose any information in                   violation of any nondisclosure agreement between Excite and                   any third party, the notice will include information                   sufficient to permit Sponsor to evaluate the requirements for                   meeting the competing offer for retail music store sponsorship                   of the Excite Site and to formulate a meaningful response.                   Sponsor will have [****] after receipt of such written notice                   to provide notice to Excite that it is prepared to enter into                   an agreement with Excite on the same terms and conditions as                   Excite proposes to accept from such third party. Excite and                   Sponsor will then promptly commence good faith negotiations to                   conclude the agreement.

               iv) If Sponsor rejects said offer or fails to notify Excite of                   its acceptance within the [****] period, Excite shall have                   the right thereafter to enter into the agreement with such                   third party, provided the terms and conditions of the                   agreement (if entered into within the subsequent ninety (90)                   days) are not less favorable to Excite than previously offered                   by Sponsor.

                                    3    4                                                                     CONFIDENTIAL

2.       IMPRESSIONS

      a)       "Impression" means any appearance of a link to the Sponsor                   Site whether graphic, text or any combination of graphic and                   text. More than one Impression may appear on a page, except,                   however, not more than three (3) Impressions per Channel page                   will count towards delivery of guaranteed Impressions and, of                   these 3 Impressions, at least two (2) will link to pages in                   the Sponsor Site offering Music Products; not more than two                   (2) Impressions per generic search results page will count                   towards delivery of guaranteed Impressions and, of these 2                   Impressions, at least one (1) will link to pages in the                   Sponsor Site offering Music Products; and no more than one (1)                   Impression per specific search results page will count towards                   delivery of guaranteed Impressions. In all events, Excite will                   make a good faith effort to avoid duplicate Impressions on a                   single page, but in no event will more than one (1)                   Impression for the same artist on a Music Product page count                   towards delivery of guaranteed Impressions. For the purposes                   of this Agreement, "generic search results page" is an Excite                   Search results page displayed in response to a query                   concerning generic music topics and a "specific search results                   page" is an Excite Search results page displayed in response                   to a query concerning a specific music artist or specific                   album title.

      b)      Excite and Sponsor will work together in good faith to define                  mutually agreeable Impressions in the Excite Site designed to                  provide content of interest (defined below) to Excite users                  and/or promote the Sponsor Site, in numbers sufficient to meet                  the Impression guarantees stated in Section 3.

      c)      Excite and Sponsor will collaborate on the design, appearance,                  and placement (the "look and feel") of all Impressions. Excite





              will have final approval over the look and feel of the                  promotional Impressions, which approval will not be                  unreasonably withheld.

3.       IMPRESSION GUARANTEES

      a)       During the first year of the sponsorship following the                   Commencement Date, Excite will deliver not less than                   [****] Impressions on the Excite Site.

      b)       During the second year of the sponsorship following the first                   anniversary of the Commencement Date, Excite will deliver not                   less than [****] Impressions on the Excite Site.

      c)       Excite will report traffic, Impressions and click-thrus to                   Sponsor on a monthly basis.

Excite may incorporate music-related content on the                   Excite Site from parties other than Sponsor so long as any                   links in or associated with such third-party content relating                   to opportunities to purchase Music Products will link to pages                   in the Sponsor Site.

      b)       Sponsor will ensure that the Content will at all times feature                   the full array of content and functionality as made generally                   available by Sponsor at the Sponsor Site and its related Web                   sites, through any other means of distribution of Sponsor's                   own branded service or through any other third-party                   relationship, where Sponsor controls the Content.

      c)       Sponsor and Excite will determine mutually agreeable methods                   for the transmission and incorporation of updates to the                   Content.

Excite will have sole                   responsibility for providing, hosting and maintaining, at its                   expense, the Excite Network and for providing and delivering                   the Broadcast Pages and for integration of Content into the                   Broadcast Pages.

      e)       Sponsor will have sole responsibility for providing, at its                   expense, the Content to Excite.

      a)       Sponsor will design and create Web pages ("Co-Branded Pages"                   or, collectively, the "Co-Branded Area") in the Sponsor Site                   incorporating music-related content to be mutually determined                   by the parties including but not limited to Content described                   in Exhibit A, subject to the terms and conditions hereunder.                   Each Co-Branded Page will display the name and/or brands of                   Sponsor and Excite.

                                    5    6                                                                     CONFIDENTIAL

               Sponsor and Excite will collaborate on the "look and feel" of                   the Co-Branded Pages including, but not limited to, the                   display, appearance and placement of the parties' respective                   names and/or brands and of advertising displayed on the                   Co-Branded Pages.

Sponsor will have sole responsibility for providing and                   maintaining, at its expense, the Sponsor Site, the Co-Branded                   Area, the content displayed on the Co-Branded Site and any                   updates thereto.

      c)       Each Co-Branded Page will include one or more links to the                   Excite Site. Excite will supply Sponsor with the URLs for                   these links.

      d)       Excite may, upon fifteen (15) days prior notice to Sponsor,                   request reasonable revisions to the Co-Branded Area as needed                   to reflect changes that will not adversely affect Sponsor,                   such as changes to Excite's name and/or brand or changes to                   the URLs for the links to the Excite Site. Sponsor will use                   reasonable efforts to accommodate Excite's requested changes

Excite will                   provide links to the Co-Branded Area from any pages on the                   Excite Site on which the Content appears. In its discretion,                   Excite may elect to provide additional links to the Co-Branded                   Area from other locations on the Excite Network and/or                   Broadcast Pages.

      f)       Reasonable excerpts or portions of the Content may be                   incorporated into Broadcast Pages, at Excite's discretion.                   Excite will have sole control over of the content,                   composition, "look and feel" and distribution of the Broadcast                   Pages.

               ii)      Total Revenue will be measured at the end of every                            three months after the Commencement Date. This                            three-month Total Revenue amount will be compared to                            an amount equal to two (2) times the corresponding                            three-month share of the applicable sponsorship fee                            described in Sections 6(c) and 6(d) (each pro rata                            share a "Revenue Floor").

Excite                   may, upon no less than thirty (30) days prior written notice                   to Sponsor, cause an independent Certified Public Accountant                   to inspect the records of Sponsor reasonably related to the                   calculation of such payments during Sponsor's normal business                   hours. The fees charged by such Certified Public Accountant in                   connection with the inspection will be paid by Excite unless                   the payments made to Excite are determined to have been less                   than ninety percent (90%) of the payment owed to Excite, in                   which case Sponsor will be responsible for the payment of the                   reasonable fees for such inspection.

However, the term of this Agreement will continue until Excite                   has made good the guaranteed number of Impressions on the                   Excite Site.

                        expiration of the fifteen (15) day notice period that                            the cause(s) of the errors, failures or outages have                            been corrected; or

               ii)      Sponsor will ensure that the Content will at all                            times be at least substantially similar to any other                            source of comparable topical content available on the                            Internet in terms of the following factors, taken as                            a whole: (i) breadth and depth of coverage, (ii)                            timeliness of content updates and (iii) reputation                            and ranking based on a cross-section of third party                            reviewers in terms of features, functionality,                            quality and other qualitative factors. In the event                            that Sponsor fails to meet these quality criteria,                            Excite may terminate this agreement on thirty (30)                            days written notice and enter into an other                            arrangements for the acquisition of similar content,                            unless Sponsor demonstrates to Excite's reasonable                            satisfaction before the expiration of the thirty (30)                            day notice period that the deficiencies in the                            Content have been corrected.

      d)       All payments that have accrued prior to the termination or                   expiration of this Agreement will be payable in full within                   thirty (30) days thereof.

      e)       The provisions of Section 12 (Confidentiality), Section 13                   (Warranty and Indemnity), Section 14 (Limitation of Liability)                   and Section 15 (Dispute Resolution) will survive any                   termination or expiration of this Agreement.

      d)       Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party may disclose                   Confidential Information (i) to the extent required by a court                   of competent jurisdiction or other governmental authority or                   otherwise as required by law or (ii) on a "need-to-know" basis                   under an obligation of confidentiality to its legal counsel,                   accountants, banks and other financing sources and their                   advisors.

Therefore, in the                   event of any breach or threatened breach of a party's                   obligations regarding trademarks, service marks or trade names                   or confidentiality, the aggrieved party will be entitled to                   seek equitable relief in addition to its other available legal                   remedies in a court of competent jurisdiction.

      b)       In the event of disputes between the parties arising from or                   concerning in any manner the subject matter of this Agreement,                   other than disputes arising from or concerning trademarks,                   service marks or trade names and/or confidentiality, the                   parties will first attempt to resolve the dispute(s) through                   good faith negotiation. In the event that the dispute(s)                   cannot be resolved through good faith negotiation, the parties                   will refer the dispute(s) to a mutually acceptable mediator.

      c)       In the event that disputes between the parties arising from or                   concerning in any manner the subject matter of this Agreement,                   other than disputes arising from or concerning trademarks,





               service marks or trade names and/or confidentiality, cannot be                   resolved through good faith negotiation and mediation, the                   parties will refer the dispute(s) to the American Arbitration                   Association for resolution through binding arbitration by a                   single arbitrator pursuant to the American Arbitration                   Association's rules applicable to commercial disputes.
