5.    Milestones and Deliverables

      5.1.  If HealthGate fails to complete the System development by the System             Completion Date, unless such failure results from the Publishers'             default in performing its obligations under this Agreement or from             an extension of time agreed in writing, the Publishers may in their             discretion notify HealthGate accordingly, and if such failure is not             remedied within 28 calendar days, HealthGate, recognising the loss             caused to the Publishers, will on demand from the Publishers pay to             the Publishers a sum calculated at the rate of 1% of the value of             the contract in respect of every 28 days which elapse from the             System Completion Date to the actual date of completion of the             System. Such sums of money will be paid by HealthGate to the             Publishers not as a penalty but as and for the ascertained and             liquidated damages owing and payable by HealthGate to the Publishers             by reason of such failure to meet the System Completion Date.

      5.2.  If HealthGate fails to complete the System by the end of the tenth             week after the System Completion Date then the Publishers (unless             such failure demonstrably results from the Publishers' default in             the performance of its obligations under this Agreement) will be             entitled without prejudice to any other rights or remedies they may             have under this Agreement or at law or in equity to terminate this             Agreement immediately by written notice.

      5.3.  If any delay in meeting the System Completion Date is in any way due             to the Publishers' fault, HealthGate will nevertheless, if the             Publishers so requests, continue with the work on the Project with a             view to completing it as soon as reasonably possible in the             circumstances, and the Development Timetable will be adjusted             accordingly.

6.    Project Management

      6.1.  HealthGate and the Publishers shall each designate the name,             address, telephone number, fax number, and e-mail address of a             Project Manager and a Deputy Project Manager. The Project Managers             shall be responsible for arranging all meetings, visits, and             consultations between the parties, and for the transmission and             receipt of technical information between the parties. The parties'             initial Project Manager and Deputy Project Manager is set forth on             the Third Schedule hereto.

      6.2.  If HealthGate has reason to believe that any estimate of any time is             likely to be exceeded or that it is likely that the Development             Timetable will not be complied with, HealthGate will immediately             inform the Publishers' Project Manager by written notice.

The Hardware shall be       capable of storing the Content, including future issues of the Journals       within the Content.

      9.4.  In the event that the system fails to pass any of the prescribed             acceptance tests or fails to satisfy the Publishers' requirements,             the Publishers shall afford HealthGate the opportunity of             rectifying, replacing and retesting the System. In the event that             the System or any part thereof again fails to be accepted, such             acceptance shall not be unreasonably withheld, or to satisfy the             Publishers' requirements of which the Publishers shall be the sole             judge, the Publishers shall (as time is of the essence of this             Agreement) be entitled, in addition to any other rights it may have             under this Agreement or in law, to have HealthGate remove the             Content from the System (in whole or in part as the Publishers so

User Scenarios

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Overview - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This document contains outlines, or "scenarios," of how users will access the Blackwell/Munksgaard Journal Publishing system that HealthGate is currently developing.

The goal of this project is to provide the high standards of Blackwell/Munksgaard publications and services to existing readers online, as well as develop an audience of new Internet users. Since the focus of this project is to expand readership and usage, the design of this project will be driven by user needs and interests.

The following scenarios illustrate how to optimally meet the needs and offer the widest selection of services to Blackwell/Munksgaard users through a series of chronological steps and options. A user is defined as any party (including individuals or other systems) that will interface with the Blackwell/Munksgaard Journal Publishing system.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- List of Scenarios - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Below is a list of the scenarios. The list will be ordered to contain the       building block scenarios first, followed by the more complex scenarios.

      User Scenarios

      This chapter contains the Blackwell/Munksgaard Journal Publishing system       user scenarios.





- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Registration - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

General Registration

      Users who access Blackwell/Munksgaard publications will fall into one of       three categories:

      a)    Non-registered users who are browsing Blackwell/Munksgaard content.             These users will have limited access to some free content, but will             not be able to access other areas or purchase products.

      b)    Registered users who have provided name, email and postal mailing             address, but have not provided credit card data. Users in this             category include those who have visited the site before and have             been assigned a user name and password, as well as Society members             who have previously registered.

      c)    Purchasing users who have registered, and provided credit card             information. These users may have bought subscriptions to             Blackwell/Munksgaard journals or other publications in the past.

      For any but the most casual browser, general registration is encouraged,       and outlined below.

      1.    Registration procedure: If a non-registered user would like to             access certain areas or services, there will be a link provided to             the registration area.

            Once the user has entered the registration area, s/he will be asked             to provide full name, email address, and postal address. After this             information has been entered, the user will be provided with a             dialog box to enter a self-selected user name and password.

      2.    Creating user name: The user name is checked for uniqueness against             all user names, then added to the database. If the name has already             been registered, the user will be provided with three suggested             names, or the option to create another user name of their own             choice.

      3.    Confirmation of registration: Once a unique user name and password             have been assigned, the user may choose to continue the purchase             process by linking to pages that will enable him/her to enter credit             card information (see "Credit Card Subscription Registration"             below). If no purchase is desired at this time, the user will end             the registration process at this point S/he will see a page that             confirms their registration. Shortly afterwards, the user will also             receive an email acknowledging their registration, and providing             instructions on what to do if they forget their user name and             password. This will also serve to ensure that the user's email             address as entered in the registration form is correct.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- BLACKWELL/MUNKSGAARD PUBLISHING SYSTEM                                         3

USER SCENARIOS                                                      REGISTRATION - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Credit Card Subscription Registration

      Users will now be able to order subscriptions to Blackwell/Munksgaard       journals and publications online via a simple registration and secure       payment process. In this scenario, the user chooses to pay with a credit       card.

      1.    Registration: When the user enters the registration area, s/he will             be asked to provide their user name and password. (See "General             Registration" above).

      2.    Tracking marketing efforts: A feature to track the efficacy of             marketing campaigns may also be incorporated. In addition to             entering the above subscriber information, the user will also be             asked to provide information pertaining to offer codes, or other             identifying characteristics of marketing offers.

      3.    Separating society memberships: Users are asked if they are a member             of a society participating in the online journals. If they select a             society, their registration information will be checked with an             updated automated listing of existing society members. Since a             society member is entitled to pre-defined journal subscriptions             under a separate agreement, this is done to ensure that a society             member is not charged. If the registering user is determined to be a             society member, follow the "Society Member Registration" scenario             instead.

      4.    Selecting a subscription plan: After entering the registration             information, the user will be prompted to select a subscription             plan.

      5.    Charging subscriptions: Once the subscription plan has been             selected, the user will then be shown a page that provides a secure             connection for credit card information. The user will be asked to





            give the credit card number, type (VISA, MasterCard, AMEX,             Discover), and expiration date.

      6.    Transaction receipt: The credit card is then validated and the user             is shown the cost that has been charged to the credit card. A             receipt is displayed on the screen, as well as emailed to the user.

      7.    Thanks/Email notification of future publications: After the             registration process is completed, the user will see a page thanking             them for their subscription order. As an added feature, new users             will be offered the option of having the table of contents of each             new issue emailed to them upon publication.

      8.    Next destination: When the above information is provided, the user             will then be given access to the cover page of the journal that has             just been ordered.

Society Member / Institutional Subscriber Self Registration

      If a user is determined to be a Society member or a paid subscriber not       know to the system (pre-subscribed by Blackwell/Munksgaard), the following       scenario applies:

      1.    Access from marketing efforts: Society membership benefits include             subscriptions to pre-defined print journals. In accordance with             marketing efforts, inserts promoting online journal registration and             the URL for the Blackwell/Munksgaard site will be provided in these             journals. Members may also find out about online service via other             marketing efforts, such as newsletters, leaflets, direct mail or             other web sites.

      2.    Registration info: Once the user accesses the site, he/she will be             provided with a form asking for basic registration information (see             "Credit Card Subscription Registration," steps 1-7).

USER SCENARIOS                                                      REGISTRATION - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      3.    Membership options: If the name has been matched and verified online             as a Society member, the user is presented with a listing of             publications and journals, etc. which they may access with existing             membership privileges.

            If the user is not verified as a current Society member, the user             will be asked to provide standard registration information (see             "Credit Card Subscription Registration").

            In addition to the publication listings, users will be given one of             three options as defined by the publisher to receive these             subscriptions:

            a. Exclusive online access

            b. Print subscription and optional online access

            c. Full access via both print subscription and online

      4.    Content for purchase: Once users have selected their subscription             method, they will be shown additional content available for             purchase.

      5.    Creating identity code for user: When content for purchase has been             selected by the user, s/he will see a form that enables them to             create a user name and password. Once the information has been             entered, another dialog box will prompt them to confirm the             password.

      6.    Assuring uniqueness of code: The user name is checked for uniqueness             against all user names, and added to the list. If the user name has             already been registered, they will be provided with three suggested             names, or the option to create another user name of their own             choice.

      7.    Purchasing additional content: If the user chooses to purchase any             of the additional content, the purchase will be charged to the             credit card information previously provided. The credit card is             validated and charged. If the credit card is declined, the user is             prompted to try again.

      8.    Transaction receipt: Once the credit card has been validated, the             page shows the cost that has been charged to the credit card.             Receipt is presented on the screen, as well as emailed to the user.

      9.    Final step of purchasing process: As the final step in the             purchasing process, the user will see a page that thanks them for             their order, and shows a listing of all content purchased in the             last transaction.

            After purchasing process has been completed, the user will then be             given access to their selected content. A confirmation email will be             sent welcoming the user to our service.





Purchase Order or Deposit Account for Institutional Subscribers

      For those institutions that wish to order subscriptions to       Blackwell/Munksgaard journals, publications, and single full-text articles       on a consistent basis, an open purchase order or deposit account may be       established. The following scenario outlines how a customer would have       access via this method.

      1.    Initial set-up: The customer will make the initial contact to             Blackwell/Munksgaard to set up the account. Open purchase orders and             deposit accounts may be established through either             Blackwell/Munksgaard or HealthGate.

      2.    Access code: After the account has been established, users will then             be given a special access code to access the Site. When registering             the user will be able to use the access code instead of providing us             with credit card information (Access to publications via IP address             verification is an option for institutional accounts).

      3.    Registration: When the user completes registration the same way as a             normal customer, except that they enter the access code rather than             provide billing information. Any charges or purchases will be             applied to their account.

      4.    Account expiration: If the account expires, or reaches the monetary             cap assigned, the user will be shown a page that prompts them to             contact Blackwell/Munksgaard to renew the account. This page will             also provide the option to continue and have purchases applied to a             credit card. A report will be available warning Blackwell/Munksgaard             of accounts that are close to expiring.

Transaction Registration /Single Document Purchase by non registered user

      This scenario outlines the way in which a user would be able to purchase a       single article (document) while browsing the abstract of the article.

      1.    Promoting full text articles: Abstracts are available to all users             free of charge; registration is not required. However, if the user             would like to buy the full text of any given article, pricing             information for the article will be listed at the end of the             abstract, with a link to purchase the article.

      2.    Purchasing full text -- registered users: After selecting the link             to purchase the article, the user is given the option to log in,             using the previously assigned registration user name and password.             After logging in, a page showing full text articles and journal             subscriptions for purchase will be provided. The user will make             his/her selections, and the credit card information page will             appear. (Go to step #5)

      3.    Purchasing full text -- new users: If the user has never registered             before, they will be asked to register.

      4.    Registration: When the user enters the registration area, s/he will             be asked to provide basic identifying information (See "General             Registration" above).

      5.    Credit card info: The user will then be shown a page that provides a             secure connection for credit card information. The user will be             asked to give the credit card number, type (VISA, MasterCard, AMEX,             Discover), and expiration date.

      6.    Credit card validation: The credit card is validated, and the user             is given confirmation that they are about to be charged for the             requested full text article(s) and/or journal subscription(s).

      7.    Fax delivery/other purchase options: An option to have the article             faxed to them for an additional fee (to be determined) is also             offered.

      8.    Transaction confirmation: Once the user has completed the above             steps, a receipt listing all purchases is shown on the page; a copy             will also be emailed to them.

      9.    Transaction cancellation: If the user cancels the transaction, then             they are returned to the abstract of the article.

      10.   Content access: After the user confirms the charge, s/he is given             access to the content for a specified period of time (hours/days to             be determined.)

            Articles are provided to the user in both PDF and HTML format

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Purchases - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      The scenarios below outline single document purchases. There also will be       a facility to purchase multiple documents in a shopping basked like       manner.

Single Document Purchase Registered User with CC Information

      In this scenario, a registered user requests a document to which they do       not currently have access. For example, they may be viewing an abstract       from a journal that is not part of their subscription, or they may be       referencing a new document (full text) In this scenario we assume that the       user has a credit card on file or an open purchase order (PO).

      1.    Registration update: At the end of an abstract, a link is provided             which enables the user to purchase a related document or product             (i.e., full text article, journal subscription, book, etc.) The link             brings the user to a page that offers purchase options, lists the             price of the full text article and allows registered users to enter             their user name and password. Non-registered users would have to             register in order to enter credit card information.

      2.    Login: Registered users will log on, confirming registration. Then             they will be shown a price confirmation and delivery options.

      3.    Optional fax delivery: If the requested document is an article, the             user will be offered an option to have the article faxed for an             additional fee (to be determined).

      4.    Transaction confirmation: Once the user has completed the above             steps, a receipt listing all purchases is shown on the page; a copy             will also be emailed to them.

      5.    Transaction cancellation: If the user cancels the transaction, they             are returned to the abstract of the article.

      6.    Content access: After the user confirms the charge, s/he is given             access to the content for a specified period of time (hours/days to             be determined.)

            Articles are provided to the user in both HTML and PDF formats.

Single Document Purchase Registered User without CC Information

      In this scenario, a registered user requests to see a document to which       they do not currently have access. For example, they may be viewing an       abstract from a new journal and decide they would like to subscribe. In       this scenario, we assume that the user does not have a credit card on file       or an open PO.

      1.    Registration update: At the end of an abstract, a link is provided             which enables the user to purchase a related document or product             (i.e., full text article, journal subscription, book, etc.) The link             brings the user to a page that offers purchase options, and lists             the price of the full text article. The user will be asked to a)             register, or b) login.

      2.    Login. Registered users will login.

      3.    Credit card info: Then if they do not have credit card information             on file or if their credit card has expired, they will be shown a             page which provides a secure connection for credit card information.             The user will be asked to give the credit card number, type (VISA,             MasterCard, AMEX, Discover), and expiration date.

      4.    Credit card validation: The credit card is validated, and the user             is given confirmation that they are about to be charged for the             requested full text article(s) journal subscription(s), etc. (Any             relevant discounts will be shown on screen at this time.)

      5.    Optional fax delivery: If the requested document is an article, the             user will be offered an option to have the article faxed for an             additional fee (to be determined).

      6.    Transaction confirmation: Once the user has completed the above             steps, a receipt listing all purchases is shown on the page; a copy             will also be emailed to them.

      7.    Transaction cancellation: If the user cancels the transaction, they             are returned to the abstract of the article.

      8.    Content access: After the user confirms the charge, he/she is given             access to the content for a specified period of time (hours/days to





            be determined).

            Articles are provided to the user in both HTML and PDF formats.

Single Document Purchase Registered User using Purchase Order

      In this scenario, a registered user requests a document to which they do       not currently have access and choose to pay via an existing purchase order       which they have set up with Blackwell/Munksgaard. If they do not have a       purchase order, they will be asked to contact Blackwell/Munksgaard.

      1.    Registration update: At the end of an abstract, a link is provided             which enables the user to purchase a related document or product             (i.e., full text article, journal subscription, book, etc.) The link             brings the user to a page that offers purchase options, and lists             the price of the full text article. The user will be asked to a)             register, or b) login.

      2.    Login. Registered users will login with an account that has been             tagged for all charges to be applied to an existing purchase order.

      3.    Purchase Order validation: The purchase order is validated to assure             that this charge will not go over the total amount on the purchase             order. The user is given confirmation that they are about to be             charged for the requested full text article(s). (Any relevant             discounts will be shown on screen at this time.)

      4.    Optional fax delivery: If the requested document is an article, the             user will be offered an option to have the article faxed for an             additional fee (to be determined).

      5.    Transaction confirmation: Once the user has completed the above             steps, a receipt listing all purchases is shown on the page; a copy             will also be emailed to them.

      6.    Transaction cancellation: If the user cancels the transaction, they             are returned to the abstract of the article.

      7.    Content access: After the user confirms the charge, he/she is given             access to the content for a specified period of time (hours/days to             be determined.)

            Articles are provided to the user in both HTML and PDF formats.

Additional Subscription Purchase

      Online users will be provided with several opportunities throughout the       site to subscribe to other journals; these purchase options will be       inserted in areas that contextually will promote the likelihood of a sale.

USER SCENARIOS                                                           LINKING - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      The following scenario provides an example of how the need for additional       full text articles and/or a journal subscription results in a sale.

      1.    Point of entry: A user reads an article in a journal to which they             subscribe. Searching for more information in this subject area, the             user clicks on the link to related articles.

      2.    Exposure to new journal: After viewing the list of related articles,             the user notes that the articles of the most interest are all in a             journal to which s/he does not currently subscribe. At this point             the user has a choice: s/he may either purchase the full text of             some or all the articles, or consider a subscription to the journal             itself, which will provide unlimited access to these and other             articles year-round. The user decides to find out more information             about the journal.

      3.    Journal description: All journal titles will be linked. When the             user clicks on a journal link, he/she will see a page that provides             a brief description of the journal, the frequency of publication,             and pricing information.

      4.    Purchasing procedure: The user decides to purchase the journal.             Since this user has already subscribed to at least one other             journal, his/her identification and credit card data are already             stored in the system.

            The user is given the option of charging the subscription to the             existing account, or entering new credit card information. (See             "Credit Card Subscription Registration" above).

      5.    Confirmation of purchase: Once the user has indicated which credit             card is to be charged, the purchase is charged and validated. The             user will then be shown a page that provides a receipt for the             journal subscription purchase. Confirmation of the purchase will             also be sent to the user via email.

      6.    Other tie-ins to purchase: After confirmation, the user may link to             his/her own custom page to find that the new subscription has been





            documented, and the custom page updated.

      7.    Next destination: At the end of the transaction, the user will be             shown the selected volume of the journal.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Linking - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bibliographic Linking within an Article

      This scenario illustrates how a user would link to and from bibliographic       information contained within an article.

      1.    Reference links: Reference citations within all articles will be             linked to bibliographic references (or endnotes.) When the user             clicks on the citation in the article, a page showing the complete             listing of references for that article will be displayed.

      2.    Database links: When the user clicks on the MEDLINE link, s/he will             be shown the corresponding MEDLINE abstract for the cited article,             if the journal is indexed for inclusion in MEDLINE. (Similar             functionality will exist with ISI Web of Science).

      3.    Full text/Journal subscription purchase option: If full text is             available for the cited reference, it will be offered for purchase             at this point; journal subscription purchase may be offered as well.             Abstracts will also be available from the references. These purchase             options will be displayed along with pricing information. If the             user is not a subscriber to the cited journal, and chooses to             purchase the article, or subscribe to the journal, new pages

            leading them through the purchase process will automatically be             shown. (See "Single Document Purchase" and "Additional Subscription             Purchase" above.)

      4.    Subscription tracking: If the user is already a subscriber to the             journal that contains the selected article, the user will be             informed that they may access the article free.

      5.    Other reference options: All articles will also contain a side bar             which lists (and links to) other full text articles available within             the Blackwell/Munksgaard collection that references this article             (forward bibliographic references).

      6.    In Press Bibliographic Links: Links will not exist to bibliographic             references that are still in press. However, the system will check             regularly to link them once the article has been published.

      7.    Exit from abstract: The user will also be able to return to the             previous article from the abstract.

Related Information Links

      When viewing an article, the user will be provided with a side bar that       outlines several related links pertaining to the article they are       currently reading. In this scenario, we highlight some of the different       types of links that may be offered.

      1.    Author listing: The names of all authors of the current article will             be provided as links. When the user clicks on the link of a selected             author, s/he will be presented with a listing of other articles             written by that author. These titles will be linked to the             corresponding abstract and/or full text. If available, full text             purchase and/or PDF versions of the selected article will be             offered.

      2.    Related articles by subject: A listing of related linked subject             areas will also be provided. When the user clicks on these areas,             s/he will receive a listing of related articles searched by MeSH             headings and keywords.

      3.    Related published information: Users interested in reading other             published information related to the chosen article will find that             the side bar provides them with links to:

            a. Correspondence (letters, editorials, etc) pertaining to that             article

            b. Errata (article addenda, corrections, etc.) pertaining to that             article

      4.    Services: The user will also be able to take advantage of certain             services. One service will be the ability to email the URL of a             chosen article to a colleague. When the user chooses this option,             s/he will be presented with a page to enter an email address, and a             "send" button.





- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Delivery Options Other than HTML - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Downloading PDF

      For those full text articles available in PDF format, the user will be       given the option of PDF downloading.

      1.    Linked PDF option: On the article page, a link offering the PDF             option will be found. The users will have the option to download the             PDF file or have it emailed to them. If the user choose to download             the document they will be prompted to save it.

      2.    Adobe instructions for downloading: If the user does not have             Acrobat installed, the download page will explain the need to             install the Acrobat plug-in. A link to Adobe for detailed             instructions on how to install the plug-in will be provided.

            If the user does not wish to download Acrobat at that time, the user             will be prompted to download to their hard drive. They may open the             PDF document after Acrobat has been downloaded at their convenience.

Fax Delivery

            Users who want the benefits of how an article appears in PDF, but             who do not wish to download the article in this format, can request             fax delivery of the article for an additional charge.

      1.    After confirming that the user wishes to purchase an article (or in             the case of subscriptions, displaying the record on screen), the             user selects the method of displaying the article: HTML, PDF, or             "Receive via Fax." Because this is a premium option, the user will             be asked to confirm the additional fees for fax delivery.

      2.    The user then supplies their fax number.

      3.    To keep costs low, the article is relayed to a commercial fax             service, such as FaxNet, which sends the information via Web-based             fax to the user.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Subscriber Features - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

User Access to their Custom Page

      Another free feature offered to Blackwell/Munksgaard subscribers is a       custom-designed page which will provide them with information tailored to       their unique areas of interest, as well as accounting of their       subscription plans and other services. The following are highlights of       features that may be offered to subscribers.

      1.    Initial log-in: The user accesses the Blackwell/Munksgaard Journals             home page. From this page there is a login link that requires the             user to enter their user name and password (if they are unable to             remember their user name and password, they may enter their email             address, which will then provide them with the correct login             information via return email). Once the correct information has been             entered, subscribers are brought to their custom page.

      2.    Custom Page features: The custom page will provide the user with:

      f)    Keywords

      g)    Article Type (Case report, review, rapid publication, original             article).

      h)    If applicable, both the MEDLINE Unique Identifier and MeSH terms             will be available

Full Text

      As users read full text documents, they will be able to access the       following feature enhancements:

      a)    Linked references: References cited within the body of the article             will be linked to the bibliographic references (endnotes) for that             article. A link from the bibliographic reference to the abstract             (pulled from secondary databases, reference databases), if             available, is provided. If the corresponding article is available             online in the Blackwell/Munksgaard collection, a link to the             full-text with option to purchase will be provided.

      b)    Publication listing by author: All primary authors of the article             will be listed. The name of each author will be linked so that if             the user selects the author's name, a listing will be provided of             other available articles written this author. Again, these articles             in turn will be linked to their corresponding abstracts. If the             corresponding article is available online in the             Blackwell/Munksgaard collection, a link to the full-text with option             to purchase will be provided.

      c)    Link by keywords: The user will be provided with an option to search             for other related articles by keyword.

      d)    Email option: If a user would like to send a link to the abstract to             a colleague, an email window will be available. The user only needs             to type in the destination email address, and an automatic message             providing the article title and corresponding URL of the abstract             will be sent.

      e)    Supplemental Information: Links to supplemental information related             to the article will be presented if the information is available.

Email version of Table of Contents

      A valuable reminder of newly released publications is the table of       contents email option. If users choose this feature (usually done during       subscription registration and payment), they will be sent the new table of       contents for each journal to which they have subscribed. This feature will       be available to both subscribers as well as non-subscribing users.





      This scenario shows what a user can do after receiving an emailed version       of the table of contents. The scenario has two parts: one for text-based       email, the other for HTML enabled email.

Text Email

      1.    Receipt of email announcement: User receives an email message and             opens it in their email reader.

      2.    Table of contents listing: The message contains the table of             contents of the newly published issue of the journal.

      3.    URL linking: The email contains the URL for the Blackwell/Munksgaard             site. This link will be "live" in most email readers, and will bring             the user directly to the online version of the table of contents.

      4.    Article linking: Once the user accesses the table of contents, s/he             will find that all titles are linked to abstracts and the online             full text article.

HTML Email

      1.    Receipt of email announcement: The user receives an HTML based email             message, and opens it in their HTML enabled mail reader (e.g.,             Outlook Express, Outlook 98, Netscape 3.x and higher).

      2.    Table of contents: The message contains the complete table of             contents, and may be viewed exactly as it would look on the web             site.

      3.    URL linking: The email contains the URL for the Blackwell/Munksgaard             site. This link will be clickable in most email readers, and will             bring the user directly to the online version of the table of             contents.

      4.    Article linking: Once the user accesses the table of contents, s/he             will find that all titles are linked to abstracts and the online             full text article.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Searching - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      The capacity to search using a variety of keywords and subject headings is       of critical importance to users, and is an especially important feature of       the Blackwell/Munksgaard site.

      Users will have the ability to select which set of journals to search.       Some example sets are: All Full Text Journals, All Subscribed Journals,       and Journals by particular Publisher. Searches that return a single       document will forward the user to the abstract or full text if they have       access to the full text.

      The following scenarios outline several ways in which a subscriber may       search for content. In addition to offering different types of searching       mechanisms (i.e., "quick searches" through advanced searches), users will       also be able to access the searching capability from various areas of the       site. The following scenarios outline some of the search possibilities.

Quick Search

      A "Quick Search" enables the user to search on a topic (e.g., insulin       pumps) and obtain a listing of areas where this topic is cited.

      1.    From custom page: From the custom page, users would enter a keyword             or phrase in the quick search box. The user would select the All             Subscribed journal set, and then submit the query.

      2.    Results: The search returns a listing of all articles; each linked             to the full text, PDF, and the abstract where available.

      3.    Save Query: On the results page, the user would have the option of             saving the query. This adds the query to the user's customized page.

Searching Full Text

      Another option is to search the entire full text of a document for       specific terms. The following is a sample of how this search could be       conducted from the user's custom page.

      1.    Advanced search option: The user selects the advanced search option             from the search box.

      2.    Document choice: The user decides to view only abstracts; s/he             selects this choice from the pull down list of available fields to             search.

      3.    Subject choice: The user chooses the keyword or phrase they wish to             search, (e.g., lispro or Humalog), and enters it into the advanced             search form. This criterion is then added to the query.

      4.    Journal choice: The user then selects the journal set to search, and             selects the "All Full Text Journals" option. The query is then             submitted.

      5.    Results: The results contain a listing of all full text articles             available that match the user's search criteria. Included in this             list is the price of each full text document that references these             keywords, with the option to download. In addition, the entries that             the user has subscription access to would be noted. Results can be             ordered by relevancy, date, author and journal title.

            The user has the ability to save the query.

Finding an Article Cited Elsewhere

      This scenario provides the user with HealthGate's Citation Finder       Technology. It allows a subscriber the ability to quickly locate the       abstract (and the full text if available) from a bibliographic reference.

      1.    Access from custom page: From the registered subscriber's customized             page, s/he selects the Citation Finder option. The Citation Finder             page is pre-loaded and has a field for entry of the citation. The             user can either input the citation information or "copy and paste"             it into the appropriate fields. The Citation Finder does not require             information in all fields to execute a search successfully.

      2.    Search criteria: The user then selects the fields, or information,             which s/he wants to search. Examples of these fields include author,             journal name, year, volume, issue, article title, and all fields.             For this example, the user selects author, article title, and             journal name.

      3.    Results: The user submits the query. If an exact match is found, the             abstract will be provided. If not, the user is presented with a list             of matches from which to select.

      Blackwell/Munksgaard will have administrative access to these features.       All access will be recorded to monitor any possible abuse.

Forgotten Password

      When a user forgets his/her password, the system provides a mechanism for       the user to look up and find their password without calling customer       service. This scenario shows how that is accomplished:

      1.    On the login page, a user who has forgotten their password selects             the link "forgotten password."

      2.    The user is asked to complete a form where the required information             is user name, first name, and last name.

      3.    The system will search the user database to see if there is a match.             If there is a match, the system will send the user's password to the             email address on file. The system will then tell the user that their             password is being sent to them via email.

      4.    If there is not a match, the system will prompt them to try again or             allow them to search for user name and password.

Forgotten User Name and Password

      When a user forgets his/her password, the system provides a mechanism for       the user to look up and find their password without calling customer       service. This scenario shows how that is accomplished:

      1.    On the login page, a user who has forgotten their password selects             the link "forgotten password."

      2.    If they do not remember their user name, the user is prompted to             enter their first name, last name, and email address.

      3.    The system will compare the information supplied by the user against             the user database and email both the user name and password to the





            address on file if there is a match.

      4.    If there is not a match, the user is instructed to either try again             or contact customer service.

Changing Password

      Users often want to change their password. The system gives them an easy       way to do so.

      1.    From the user's personal profile page, the user selects the link to             "Modify Profile."

      2.    The Modify Profile page will allow them to go to a change password             form.

      3.    This form will ask the user to type their current password, then             enter a new password. To confirm, the user is asked to type their             new password again.

      4.    Upon correct entry (the old password matched the one on file and the             two new passwords matched), the password will be updated and the             user will be told that the change has been made.

      5.    If the entry is not correct then the user will be prompted to try             again.

Changing Email Address

      Users often want to change their email address. The system gives them an       easy way to do so.

      1.    This feature is available in several places, such as the "Modify             Profile" page and the regularly scheduled email messages sent by the             system to the user.

      2.    From the Modify Profile page, the user would select a link to change             their email address. From an email message, the user selects the             link embedded in the email. When accessing the appropriate page via             the email link, the user will be prompted for user name and             password.

      3.    A form will ask for the users new email address (actually allowing             them to edit their old email address).

      4.    Upon successful entry, the email address is checked for validity and             an email message is sent the address for confirmation.

Changing Credit Card Number

      Users often want to change their credit card information on file. The       system gives them an easy way to do so. This method of updating the credit       card is also used when the credit card on file has expired. Customers with       expired credit cards are forced to enter a new credit card when they are       about to incur additional charges.

      1.    This feature is available from the "Modify Profile" page.

      2.    The user is connected to the secure server and asked to enter the             new credit card information.

      3.    The credit card is validated with a credit card clearing house.

      4.    If validated, the user is given a confirmation page.

      5.    If the card is not validated, the user is asked to try again.

Changing Other Information

      Users are able to change other information off the "Modify Profile" page       by selecting the appropriate link. Examples of other information that may       be changed are postal address, purchasing new subscriptions, and change       the format in which they received emailed information (HTML verses text).

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Content Management - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Journal Setup

      The procedure to setup new journals and their initial entry into the       system must be initiated by Blackwell/Munksgaard. It is possible to setup       a journal manually or electronically. The manual procedure for setting up       a new journal entry is as follows:

      1.    The authorized Blackwell/Munksgaard employee establishes a             connection to the Administration side of the site.





      2.    When prompted, the employee enters the appropriate user             name/password and establishes a secure connection.

      3.    The employee selects the option New Journal and enters all             applicable information, such as title, copyright statements,             submissions, subscription, etc.

      4.    The employee enters Society information, if applicable, including             name, links, and board members.

Set Journal Price

      It is possible to setup a journal price manually or electronically. After       setting up the basic journal information, pricing criteria may be entered:

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- BLACKWELL/MUNKSGAARD JOURNAL PUBLISHING                                       18

USER SCENARIOS                                                CONTENT PUBLISHING - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      1.    The authorized Blackwell/Munksgaard employee accesses the             appropriate journal (the journal must be setup using the Journal             Setup before establishing the journal price) and selects the option             "Journal Pricing."

      2.    The employee then assigns the price in multiple currencies, any and             all subscription plans, including rates for print companion,             electronic only, and Society membership.

      3.    The employee then assigns pricing for each of the selected             currencies.

Set Document Price

      1.    The default for all document pricing is established by             Blackwell/Munksgaard. The Blackwell/Munksgaard employee may override             the default and establish a special price for documents from a             specific journal title.

      2.    To override the default document price, the employee accesses the             appropriate journal (the journal must be setup using the Journal             Setup before establishing the document price) and selects the option             "Document Pricing."

      3.    The employee then assigns the revised price in various currencies             for document delivery.

      4.    The price may be revised to the default at any time by accessing the             journal and selecting the option to Restore Default Price.

Template Submission

      Initially, templates will be hand loaded by HealthGate Data Corp. to       insure security and consistency.

      To accomplish this, an FTP location will be provided to allow templates to       be copied over and reviewed (and tested) prior to releasing them.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Content Publishing - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Issue Loading

      1.    Loading upon receipt: All content for a new issue is loaded upon             receipt in a single directory.

      2.    Identification: A form is completed which indicates appropriate             journal, issue, and volume. It is also possible to enter this             information electronically.

      3.    Back-up: Upon submission, the content is copied to the content             repository, before conversion. This allows it to be referenced in             the future.

      4.    Conversion: The content is then converted to our internal Extensible             Markup Language (XML) format.

      5.    Storage: The XML version is then stored in the content repository.

      6.    Parsing: The XML is then parsed to add more information, including             tags to link bibliographic information and related information.

      7.    Storage of parsed content: This parsed XML version is also stored in             the content repository.

      8.    Conversion to HTML: An Extensible Style Language (XSL) template is             used to convert the file to HTML.

      9.    HTML on staging: The HTML version is made available on the staging             server.

Issue Review

      1.    The issue is made available on the staging server

      2.    Email is sent to Blackwell/Munksgaard alerting the appropriate             personnel that the issue is available for review.

      3.    An employee wishing to review the issue would log on to the staging             server, and select the content they wish to review. This is limited             to authorized users only. Authorization is by group of journals.

      4.    The content is presented to them in the same way it is shown to an             end user. However, they also have access to a tool bar (in a frame).             The tool bar allows them to approve the content as well as adjust             some of the properties of the article.

      5.    They can change the price or approve the article for release.

Issue Release

      An issue will be released automatically on the assigned electronic       publication date if all the articles contained in the issue have been       edited and approved for release. Blackwell/Munksgaard will be alerted to       content that has not be reviewed after a predetermined amount of time.

      A Blackwell/Munksgaard employee would access the Journal Publishing       System, a secure area, and go to the System Control area.

      1.    A list of issues that are ready or awaiting publication would be             available. When an issue is selected, the listing of properties for             that issue will be presented.

      2.    The user would be able to adjust any of the properties.

      3.    To publish the issue, the user would set the publication date to the             following day.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Third Party Access - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

General

      Creating an abstract-only export: To create an abstract-only export, a       Blackwell/Munksgaard employee will need to determine the list of journal       abstracts to be included for extract, the formatting of the extract, and a       user profile of which third parties will have access to the extract file.

      1.    Criteria: Once the above information has been determined, the             following information will need to be entered:

            a. Frequency of updating abstract information,

            b. Packaging method (tar, zip), push, pull or tape.

      2.    Push extracts: For push extracts (extracts that are sent to someone             either via FTP or email), a user will have to enter the destination             email address, or the FTP server, directory, user name and password             to use.

      3.    Pull extracts: For pull extracts (extracts that require someone to             pull the content off the journal server), a user will have to enter             the user name and password that the third party will use to retrieve             the content.

      4.    Tape based abstracts: Tape based abstracts will be handled similar             to FTP pulls except that they would be loaded to tape and sent via             postal service.

Abstracts Only (Headers)

      Some customers want the abstracts only. This will allow bibliographic       database to receive the information in electronic form rather than having       to re-key the documents. Ideally, all databases would also receive       information pointing them to the full text version of the documents. The       directory structure will also be included with this abstract. It is       possible to create a different directory structure and will have to be       handled on an ad-hoc basis.

      This scenario will be completed upon the supply of the final version of       the Blackwell/Munksgaard DTD.





Abstracts and PDF (Headers and PDF)

      This type of export would use the same DTD as the abstracts only, but       would include a reference to the PDF file inside each header. This extract       would obviously also include the PDF files.

Full Text Blackwell/Munksgaard DTD

      This export will take the Blackwell/Munksgaard SGML files in full as well       as graphic files and PDF files.

Full Text in Ovid's DTD

      This export will convert the full text to Ovid's DTD and includes the       graphic files and PDF files.

Delivery Options for Third Parties

      Third parties will have the option to receive information via HTTP, FTP       (either sent to them or picked up), tape (4mm, 8mm, DLT) or CD-ROM.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Reporting - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      This section defines some of the reports available to       Blackwell/Munksgaard. It is expected that customization of reports will       continue to be refined over the duration of the project. This will allow       both HealthGate and Blackwell/Munksgaard to make necessary adjustments. As       a future direction HealthGate will provide direct access to the SQL       database (via ODBC or similar methods).
