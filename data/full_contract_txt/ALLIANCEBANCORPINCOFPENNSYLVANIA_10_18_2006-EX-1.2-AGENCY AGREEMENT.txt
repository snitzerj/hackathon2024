Ladies and Gentlemen:

Greater Delaware Valley Holdings, A Mutual Company, a Pennsylvania-chartered mutual holding company (the "PA MHC"), Alliance Mutual Holding Company, a federal mutual savings and loan holding company in formation (the "Federal MHC"), Alliance Bancorp, Inc. of Pennsylvania, a federal stock holding company in formation (the "Company"), and Greater Delaware Valley Savings Bank d/b/a Alliance Bank, a Pennsylvania-chartered stock savings bank (the "Bank"), hereby confirm their agreement with Sandler O'Neill & Partners, L.P. ("Sandler O'Neill" or the "Agent") with respect to the offer and sale by the Company of up to 2,445,223 shares (subject to increase to up to 2,812,006 shares in the event of an increase in the pro forma market value of the Company's common stock) of the Company's common stock, par value $.01 per share (the "Common Stock"). The shares of Common Stock to be sold by the Company in the Offerings (as defined below) are hereinafter called the "Securities."

The PA MHC and the Bank have determined to undertake a reorganization pursuant to which the Company will be created as a mid-tier holding company, the outstanding capital stock of the Bank will be exchanged for shares of the Common Stock, and the PA MHC will convert from a Pennsylvania-chartered mutual holding company to a federally-chartered mutual holding company under the name Alliance Mutual Holding Company, all in accordance with the Agreement and Plan

th





of Reorganization, dated as of June 21, 2006, as may be amended from time to time pursuant to the terms thereof. Concurrently therewith, the Securities are being offered for sale in the Offerings (as defined below) in accordance with the Plan of Additional Stock Issuance dated June 21, 2006 as may be amended from time to time pursuant to the terms thereof. The Agreement and Plan of Reorganization and the Plan of Additional Stock Issuance are hereinafter referred to collectively as the "Plans." The PA MHC and Federal MHC are hereinafter referred to collectively as the "MHCs."

Pursuant to the Plans, the Company will offer to certain depositors of the Bank and to the Bank's tax qualified employee benefit plans, including the Bank's employee stock ownership plan (the "ESOP") (collectively, the "Employee Plans"), rights to subscribe for the Securities in a subscription offering (the "Subscription Offering"). To the extent Securities are not subscribed for in the Subscription Offering, such Securities may be offered to certain members of the general public and to other persons in a community offering (the "Community Offering"), with preference given first to natural persons and trusts of natural persons residing in Delaware and Chester Counties, Pennsylvania and then to the Bank's stockholders as of ___________, 2006. The Community Offering, which together with the Subscription Offering, as each may be extended or reopened from time to time, is herein referred to as the "Subscription and Community Offering," may be commenced concurrently with, during or after, the Subscription Offering. It is currently anticipated that any Securities not subscribed for in the Subscription and Community Offering will be offered, subject to Section 2 hereof, in a syndicated community offering (the "Syndicated Community Offering"). The Subscription and Community Offering and the Syndicated Community Offering are hereinafter referred to collectively as the "Offerings." The conversion of the PA MHC from a state-chartered mutual holding company to a federally-chartered mutual holding company, the formation of the Company, the exchange of the capital stock of the Bank for capital stock of the Company and the Offerings are hereinafter referred to collectively as the "Reorganization and Additional Stock Issuance." As a result of the Reorganization and Additional Stock Issuance, the Bank, which is currently 80.02% owned by the PA MHC, will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and the Company will be 55% owned by the Federal MHC. The Securities may be offered to the general public in a public offering (the "Public Offering") in lieu of or subsequent to the Syndicated Community Offering. If there is a Public Offering, the Public Offering will be governed by a separate definitive purchase agreement as described in Section 2 hereof. It is acknowledged that the number of Securities to be sold in the Offerings may be increased or decreased in accordance with the Plans. If the number of Securities is increased or decreased, the term "Securities" shall mean such greater or lesser number, where applicable. In the event that a mid-tier holding company form of organization is not utilized, all pertinent terms of this Agreement will apply to the sale of the Bank's common stock.

The Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement on Form S-1 (No. 333- 136853), including a related prospectus, for the registration of the Securities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), has filed such amendments thereto, if any, and such amended prospectuses as may have been required to the date hereof by the Commission in order to declare such registration statement effective, and will file such additional amendments thereto and such amended prospectuses and prospectus supplements as may hereafter be required.

SECTION 2. APPOINTMENT OF SANDLER O'NEILL; SALE AND DELIVERY OF THE SECURITIES; CLOSING. On the basis of the representations and warranties herein contained and subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, the Company hereby appoints Sandler O'Neill as its Agent to consult with and advise the Company, and to assist the Company with the solicitation of subscriptions and purchase orders for Securities, in connection with the Company's sale of Common Stock in the Offerings. On the basis of the representations and warranties herein contained, and subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, Sandler O'Neill accepts such appointment and agrees to use its best efforts to assist the Company with the solicitation of subscriptions and purchase orders for Securities in accordance with this Agreement; provided, however, that the Agent shall not be obligated to take any action which is inconsistent with any applicable laws, regulations, decisions or orders. The services to be rendered by Sandler O'Neill pursuant to this appointment include the following: (i) consulting as to the securities marketing implications of any aspect of the Plans or related corporate documents; (ii) reviewing with the Board of Directors of the Company, the MHCs and the Bank financial and securities marketing implications of the Appraiser's appraisal of the Common Stock; (iii) reviewing all offering documents, including the Prospectus, stock order forms and related offering materials (it being understood that preparation and filing of such documents is the sole responsibility of the Company and the Bank and their counsel); (iv) assisting in the design and implementation of a marketing strategy for the Offerings; (v) assisting management of the Company and the Bank in preparing for meetings with potential investors and broker-dealers; and (vi) providing such other general advice and assistance regarding financial and marketing aspects of the Offering as may be requested to promote the successful completion of the Offering.

The appointment of the Agent hereunder shall terminate upon the earlier to occur of (a) forty-five (45) days after the last day of the Subscription and Community Offering, unless

17





the Company and the Agent agree in writing to extend such period and the OTS agrees to extend the period of time in which the Securities may be sold, or (b) the receipt and acceptance of subscriptions and purchase orders for all of the Securities, or (c) the completion of the Syndicated Community Offering.

If any of the Securities remain available after the expiration of the Subscription and Community Offering, at the request of the Company and the Bank, Sandler O'Neill will seek to form a syndicate of registered brokers or dealers ("Selected Dealers") to assist in the solicitation of purchase orders of such Securities on a best efforts basis. Sandler O'Neill will endeavor to limit the aggregate fees to be paid by the Company, the MHCs and the Bank to an amount competitive with gross underwriting discounts charged at such time for underwritings of comparable amounts of stock sold at a comparable price per share in a similar market environment; provided, however, that the aggregate fees payable to Sandler O'Neill and Selected Dealers shall not exceed 6.0% of the aggregate dollar amount of the Securities sold in the Syndicated Community Offering by such Selected Dealers. Sandler O'Neill will endeavor to distribute the Securities among the Selected Dealers in a fashion which best meets the distribution objective of the Company and the Bank, which may result in limiting the allocation of stock to certain Selected Dealers. It is understood that in no event shall Sandler O'Neill be obligated to act as a Selected Dealer or to take or purchase any Securities.

If any of the Securities remain available after the expiration of the Offerings, the Company agrees to offer the Agent the first right to act as lead managing underwriter for the Public Offering. The terms of the Public Offering will be set forth in a separate definitive purchase agreement in a form satisfactory to Sandler O'Neill and containing customary representations, warranties, conditions, agreements and indemnities, which purchase agreement, when executed, will supersede and replace this Agreement with respect to Securities sold thereunder (the "Purchase Agreement"). This Agreement is not intended to constitute, and should not be construed as, an agreement or commitment between the Company, the Bank and Sandler O'Neill relating to the firm commitment underwriting of any securities, and Sandler O'Neill may, in its sole judgment and discretion, determine at any time not to proceed with the proposed firm commitment underwriting. Such proposed underwriting will be subject, among other things, to: (i) satisfactory completion by Sandler O'Neill of such due diligence investigation or inquiries as it may deem appropriate, (ii) market conditions, which, in the sole judgment of Sandler O'Neill, shall be satisfactory, and (iii) the execution and delivery of a definitive Purchase Agreement.

In the event the Company is unable to sell at least the total minimum of the Securities, as set forth on the cover page of the Prospectus, within the period herein provided, this Agreement shall terminate and the Company shall refund to any persons who have subscribed for any of the Securities the full amount which it may have received from them, together with interest as provided in the Prospectus, and no party to this Agreement shall have any obligation to the others hereunder, except for the obligations of the Company, the MHCs and the Bank as set forth in Sections 4, 6(a) and 7 hereof and the obligations of the Agent as provided in Sections 6(b) and 7 hereof. Appropriate arrangements for placing the funds received from subscriptions for Securities or other offers to purchase Securities in

18





special interest-bearing accounts with the Bank until all Securities are sold and paid for were made prior to the commencement of the Subscription Offering, with provision for refund to the purchasers as set forth above, or for delivery to the Company if all Securities are sold.

If at least the total minimum of Securities, as set forth on the cover page of the Prospectus, are sold, the Company agrees to issue or have issued the Securities sold and to release for delivery certificates for such Securities at the Closing Time against payment therefor by release of funds from the special interest-bearing accounts referred to above. The closing shall be held at the offices of Elias, Matz, Tiernan & Herrick L.L.P., at 10:00 a.m., Eastern Standard Time, or at such other place and time as shall be agreed upon by the parties hereto, on a business day to be agreed upon by the parties hereto. The Company shall notify the Agent by telephone, confirmed in writing, when funds shall have been received for all the Securities. Certificates for Securities shall be delivered directly to the purchasers thereof in accordance with their directions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, certificates for Securities purchased through Selected Dealers shall be made available to the Agent for inspection at least 48 hours prior to the Closing Time at such office as the Agent shall designate. The hour and date upon which the Company shall release for delivery all of the Securities, in accordance with the terms hereof, is herein called the "Closing Time."

The Company will pay any stock issue and transfer taxes which may be payable with respect to the sale of the Securities.

In addition to the reimbursement of the expenses specified in Section 4 hereof, the Agent will receive the following compensation for its services hereunder:

(a) One percent (1.00%) of the aggregate purchase price of the Securities sold in the Subscription and Community Offering, excluding in each case shares purchased by (i) any employee benefit plan of the Company or the Bank established for the benefit of their respective directors, officers and employees, and (ii) any director, officer or employee of the Company or the Bank or members of their immediate families (which term shall mean parents, grandparents, spouse, siblings, children and grandchildren); and

(b) With respect to any Securities sold by a National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. ("NASD") member firm (other than Sandler O'Neill) in the Syndicated Community Offering, (i) the compensation payable to Selected Dealers, (ii) any sponsoring dealer's fees; and (iii) a management fee to Sandler O'Neill of one percent (1.0 %) of the aggregate purchase price of the Securities sold in the Syndicated Community Offering. Any fees payable to Sandler O'Neill for Securities sold by Sandler O'Neill under any such agreement shall be limited to an aggregate of six percent (6.0 %) of the purchase price of the Securities sold by Sandler O'Neill and other NASD member firms.

If this Agreement is terminated by the Agent in accordance with the provisions of Section 9(a) hereof, no fee shall be payable by the Company to Sandler O'Neill; provided, however, that the Company shall reimburse the Agent for all of its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred prior to termination, including the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for the Agent in accordance with the provisions of Section 4 hereof. In addition, the

19





Company shall be obligated to pay the fees and expenses as contemplated by the provisions of Section 4 hereof in the event of any such termination.

All fees payable to the Agent hereunder shall be payable in immediately available funds at Closing Time, or upon the termination of this Agreement, as the case may be. In recognition of the long lead times involved in the conversion process, the Bank agreed to make an advance payment to the Agent in the amount of $25,000, all of which has been previously paid, which shall be credited against any fees or reimbursement of expenses payable hereunder. In the event that the advance payment exceeds the amount due in payment of fees and reimbursement of expenses hereunder, the excess shall be refunded.

An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of any such action. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to no more than one local counsel in each separate jurisdiction in which any action or proceeding is commenced) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances.

(d) The Company, the MHCs and the Bank also agree that the Agent shall not have any liability (whether direct or indirect, in contract or tort or otherwise) to the MHCs and its members, the Bank, the Company's, the MHCs's or the Bank's creditors relating to or arising out of the engagement of the Agent pursuant to, or the performance by the Agent of the services contemplated by, this Agreement.

(e) In addition to, and without limiting, the provisions of Section (6)(a)(iv) hereof, in the event that the Agent, any person, if any, who controls the Agent within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act or any of its partners, directors, officers, employees or agents is requested or required to appear as a witness or otherwise gives testimony in any action, proceeding, investigation or inquiry brought by or on behalf of or against the Company, the MHCs, the Bank, the Agent or any of its respective affiliates or any participant in the transactions contemplated hereby in which the Agent or such person or agent is not named as a defendant, the Company, the MHCs, and the Bank, jointly and severally, agree to reimburse the Agent and its partners, directors, officers, employees or agents for all reasonable and necessary out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with preparing or appearing as a witness or otherwise giving testimony and to compensate the Agent and its partners, directors, officers, employees or agents in an amount to be mutually agreed upon.

SECTION 7. CONTRIBUTION. In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnity agreement provided for in Section 6 hereof is for any reason held to be unenforceable by the indemnified parties although applicable in accordance with its terms, the Company, the MHCs, the Bank, and the Agent shall contribute to the aggregate losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses of the nature contemplated by said indemnity agreement incurred by the Company, the MHCs or the Bank and the Agent, as incurred, in such proportions (i) that the Agent is responsible for that portion represented by the percentage that the maximum aggregate

37





marketing fees appearing on the cover page of the Prospectus bears to the maximum aggregate gross proceeds appearing thereon and the Company, the MHCs and the Bank are jointly and severally responsible for the balance or (ii) if, but only if, the allocation provided for in clause (i) is for any reason held unenforceable, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits to the Company, the MHCs and the Bank on the one hand and the Agent on the other, as reflected in clause (i), but also the relative fault of the Company, the MHCs and the Bank on the one hand and the Agent on the other, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations; provided, however, that no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section, each person, if any, who controls the Agent within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Agent, and each director of the Company, the MHCs and the Bank, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company, the MHCs or the Bank within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, the MHCs and the Bank. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, to the extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the Agent be required to contribute an aggregate amount in excess of the aggregate marketing fees to which the Agent is entitled and actually paid pursuant to this Agreement.

SECTION 8. REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND AGREEMENTS TO SURVIVE DELIVERY. All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement, or contained in certificates of officers of the Company, the MHCs or the Bank submitted pursuant hereto, shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Agent or any controlling person, or by or on behalf of the Company, and shall survive delivery of the Securities.

SECTION 9. TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT.

38





good faith opinion would make it inadvisable to proceed with the offering, sale or delivery of the Securities; (vi) if, in the Agent's good faith opinion, the price for the Securities established by the Appraiser is not reasonable or equitable under then prevailing market conditions, or (vii) if the Offerings are not consummated on or prior to June 30, 2007.

(b) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Section, such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party except as provided in Sections 2 and 4 hereof relating to the reimbursement of expenses and except that the provisions of Sections 6 and 7 hereof shall survive any termination of this Agreement.
