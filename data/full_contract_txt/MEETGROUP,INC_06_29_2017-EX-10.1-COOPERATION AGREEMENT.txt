NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and the mutual covenants and agreements contained herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound hereby, agree as follows:   1. Board Composition Matters.    (a) Appointment of New Director A. The Company agrees that it shall take all action as is necessary (including, without limitation, calling a special meeting of the Board to approve all actions contemplated hereby), effective immediately following the execution of this Agreement, to (i) cause the Board to increase the size of its membership from six (6) to seven (7) members; (ii) accept the resignation of one existing member of the Board to become effective immediately prior to the appointment of New Director A; and (iii) appoint New Director A to the Board with a term on the Board expiring at the Company's 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "2018 Annual Meeting") and until his successor is duly elected and qualified. The Company further agrees that without the unanimous approval of the Board, during the period from the execution of this Agreement until the expiration of the Standstill Period (as defined below), the size of the Board shall not be increased beyond seven (7) members.





    (i) Identification and Appointment of New Director B. No later than ninety (90) calendar days from the date of execution of this Agreement (the "New Director B Appointment Deadline"), the Company shall take the necessary steps to cause the Board to appoint one of the candidates set forth on Exhibit A (as the same may be supplemented or otherwise amended from time to time by the mutual constent of the Company and the Investor Group, the "Director Candidate Pool") as New Director B with a term on the Board expiring at the 2018 Annual Meeting and until his or her successor is duly elected and qualified. The Company agrees that, if New Director B is not appointed to the Board prior to the New Director B Appointment Deadline and none of the candidates included in the Director Candidate Pool are willing to serve on the Board by the New Director B Appointment Deadline, (1) the Company and Investor Group will discuss in good faith the identification and selection of a mutually agreed upon substitute person to be added to the Director Candidate Pool following the same process that they would follow pursuant to Section 1(f) hereof if either of the New Directors, following their appointment to the Board, is unable to serve as a director for any reason, resigns as a director, or is removed as a director prior to the end of the term of office; and (2) the New Director B Appointment Deadline shall no longer apply and, in lieu thereof, shall be replaced by the time periods set forth in Section 1(f) hereof.   (b) Board's Review of Qualifications and Determination of Independence. Prior to the execution of this Agreement (i) the Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board (the "Nominating Committee") has reviewed the qualifications of New Director A and each of the individuals included within the Director Candidate Pool to serve as members of the Board and has determined that they are so qualified, and (ii) the Board has determined that each of the New Directors and each of the individuals included within the Director Candidate Pool are "independent" as defined by the listing standards of NASDAQ.   (c) Committees. The Company agrees that, concurrent with the appointment of the New Directors to the Board, the Board shall take such action as is necessary such that each of the New Directors is appointed to at least one (1) of the three (3) standing committees of the Board that the Company is required to maintain in accordance with the NASDAQ listing standards; provided that, with respect to each such committee appointment, the New Director is and continues to remain eligible to serve as a member of such committee pursuant to applicable law and the rules of NASDAQ that are applicable to the composition of such committee.   (d) Board Policies and Procedures. The Investor Group acknowledges that each of the New Directors shall be required to comply with all policies, processes, procedures, codes, rules, standards, and guidelines applicable to members of the Board, as in effect from time to time, including, but not limited to, the Company's Code of Conduct, and policies on confidentiality, ethics, hedging and pledging of Company securities, public disclosures, stock trading, and stock ownership, and that each of the New Directors shall be required to strictly preserve the confidentiality of Company business and information, including the discussion of any matters considered in meetings of the Board whether or not the matters relate to material non-public information, unless previously publicly disclosed by the Company. Further, the Investor Group acknowledges that the New Directors will be requested to provide the Company with such information as is reasonably requested by the Company concerning the New Directors as is required to be disclosed under applicable law or stock exchange regulations, including the completion of the Company's standard director and officer questionnaire, in each case as promptly as necessary to enable the timely filing of the Company's proxy statement and other periodic reports with the SEC.     2





    (e) Rights and Benefits of the New Directors. The Company agrees that each of the New Directors shall receive (i) the same benefits of director and officer insurance, and any indemnity and exculpation arrangements available generally to the directors on the Board, (ii) the same compensation for his service as a director as the compensation received by other non-management directors on the Board, and (iii) such other benefits on the same basis as all other non-management directors on the Board.   (f) Replacements. The Company agrees that, during the Standstill Period (as defined below), if any of the New Directors is unable to serve as a director for any reason, resigns as a director, or is removed as a director prior to the end of the term of office, and at such time the Investor Group beneficially owns in the aggregate at least three percent (3.0%) of the Company's then outstanding Common Stock (subject to adjustment for share issuances, stock splits, reclassifications, combinations and similar actions by the Company that increase the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock), then the Company and the Investor Group shall work together in good faith to identify and select a replacement director candidate to be appointed to the Board which shall only be appointed to the Board after having been mutually agreed upon by both the Company and the Investor Group. Any such mutually agreed upon replacement director candidate shall qualify as "independent" pursuant to NASDAQ's listing standards and have the relevant financial and business experience to fill the resulting vacancy. Each of the Investor Group and the Company shall determine, and inform the other party of its determination, whether any proposed replacement director candidate is acceptable and meets the foregoing criteria, within ten (10) business days after such party has conducted interview(s) of such proposed replacement director candidate. Each of the Company and the Investor Group shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause any interview(s) contemplated by this Section 1(f) to be conducted as promptly as practicable, but in any case, assuming reasonable availability of the proposed replacement director candidate, within ten (10) business days after the receipt of such director candidate's credentials, including, but not limited to, a completed copy of the Company's standard director and officer questionnaire. Upon acceptance of a replacement director candidate by both the Company and the Investor Group, the Board shall take such actions as to appoint such replacement director candidate to the Board no later than ten (10) business days after both parties have confirmed in writing that they have mutually agreed upon such candidate. Following the appointment of any director to replace a New Director in accordance with this Section 1(f), any reference to New Directors herein shall be deemed to include such replacement director.     3

(e) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary:   (i) The provisions of Sections 1, 2, and 3 of this Agreement shall automatically terminate upon the occurrence of a Change of Control transaction (as defined below) involving the Company if the acquiring or counter-party to the Change of Control transaction has conditioned the closing of the transaction on the termination of such sections; provided, however, that the Company shall not directly or indirectly, propose, seek, encourage or otherwise influence such acquiring or counter-party to the Change of Control transaction to condition the closing of such transaction on the termination of Sections 1, 2, and 3 of this Agreement; and     8
