Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc. 10 South Wacker Drive Investment Banking, Suite 3400 Chicago, Illinois 60606

Ladies and Gentlemen:

Blue Hills Bancorp, Inc. (the "Holding Company"), a newly formed Maryland corporation, Hyde Park Bancorp, MHC, a Massachusetts­ chartered mutual holding company (the "MHC"), Hyde Park Bancorp, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation (the "Mid­Tier"), and Blue Hills Bank, a Massachusetts­chartered stock savings bank (the "Bank" and together with the Holding Company, the MHC and the Mid­Tier, the "Blue Hills Parties"), hereby confirm their agreement with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc. (the "Agent") as follows:

Section 1. The Offering. The MHC, in accordance with the plan of conversion as adopted by the Boards of Directors of each of the Blue Hills Parties (the "Plan"), intends to convert from the current mutual holding company form of organization to a stock holding company form of organization (the "Conversion"). Pursuant to the Plan, the Holding Company will offer and sell up to 24,150,000 shares (subject to increase up to 27,772,500 shares) of its common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the "Shares"), in a subscription offering (the "Subscription Offering") to (1) depositors of the Bank with Qualifying Deposits (as defined in the Plan) as of February 28, 2013 ("Eligible Account Holders"), (2) the Bank's tax­ qualified employee benefit plans, including the employee stock ownership plan established by the Bank (the "ESOP"), and (3) employees, officers, directors, trustees and corporators of the Bank, the Mid-Tier and the MHC who do not have a higher priority to purchase stock. Subject to the prior subscription rights of the above­listed parties, the Holding Company may offer for sale in a direct community offering (the "Community Offering" and when referred to together with or subsequent to the Subscription Offering, the "Subscription and Community Offering") the Shares not subscribed for or ordered in the Subscription Offering to members of the general public to whom a copy of the Prospectus (as hereinafter defined) is delivered with a preference given first to natural persons and trusts of natural persons residing in the local community as defined in the Plan, and thereafter to cover orders of other members of the general public. It is anticipated that Shares not subscribed for in the Subscription and Community Offering may be offered to certain members of the general public on a best efforts basis through a selected dealers agreement (the "Syndicated Community Offering") or to certain members of the general public in a firm commitment underwritten offering (the "Underwritten Offering") with the Agent acting as sole book­running manager (the Underwritten Offering, Subscription Offering, Community Offering and Syndicated Community Offering are collectively referred to as the "Offering"). It is acknowledged that the purchase of Shares in the Offering is subject to the maximum and minimum purchase limitations as described in the Plan and that the Holding Company may reject, in whole or in part, any order received in the Community Offering or Syndicated Community Offering.





The Holding Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333­194486) (the "Registration Statement"), containing a prospectus relating to the Subscription and Community Offering, for the registration of the Shares under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "1933 Act"), and has filed such amendments thereof and such amended prospectuses as may have been required to the date hereof. The term "Registration Statement" shall include all financial schedules and exhibits thereto, as amended, including post-effective amendments. The prospectus, as amended, on file with the Commission at the time the Registration Statement initially became effective is hereinafter called the "Prospectus," except that if any prospectus is filed by the Holding Company pursuant to Rule 424(b) or (c) of the rules and regulations of the Commission under the 1933 Act (the "1933 Act Regulations") differing from the prospectus on file at the time the Registration Statement initially became effective, the term "Prospectus" shall refer to the prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) or (c) from and after the time said prospectus is filed with the Commission.

In accordance with the Massachusetts General Laws and the rules and regulations governing the conversion of Massachusetts mutual holding companies to stock holding companies (including, without limitation, Chapter 167H of the Massachusetts General Laws and Chapter 33, Subpart D of the Code of Massachusetts Regulations), as from time to time amended or supplemented (the "Massachusetts Regulations"), the MHC has filed the Plan with the Massachusetts Division of Banks (the "Division") and has filed such amendments thereto and supplementary materials as may have been required to the date hereof (such application, as amended to date, if applicable, and as subsequently amended, if applicable, is hereinafter referred to as the "Massachusetts Conversion Application"), including copies of the MHC's Notice and Information Statement for a Special Meeting of its Corporators relating to the Conversion (the "Information Statement"), the Appraisal, and the Prospectus.

In addition, the Holding Company has filed with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "FRB") an Application to Become a Bank Holding Company and/or Acquire an Additional Bank or Bank Holding Company on Form FR Y­3 (the "Holding Company Application") to become a bank holding company under Section 3 of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the "BHCA"), as in effect at the time and the FRB has approved the Holding Company Application. The Massachusetts Conversion Application and the Holding Company Application are collectively referred to herein as the "Applications".

Section 2. Retention of Agent; Compensation; Sale and Delivery of the Shares. Subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, the Blue Hills Parties hereby appoint the Agent as their exclusive financial advisor and conversion agent (i) to utilize its best efforts to solicit subscriptions for Shares and to advise and assist the Holding Company and the Bank with respect to the sale of the Shares in the Offering and (ii) to participate in the Offering in the areas of market making and in syndicate formation or to act as sole book-running manager in the Underwritten Offering (if necessary).

On the basis of the representations, warranties, and agreements herein contained, but subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, the Agent accepts such appointment and agrees to consult with and advise the Blue Hills Parties as to the matters set forth in the letter agreements, dated October 7, 2013, among the MHC, the Mid-Tier, the Bank and the Agent (a copy of each of which is attached hereto as Exhibit A and Exhibit B). It is acknowledged by the Blue Hills Parties that the Agent shall not be required to purchase any Shares in the Subscription Offering, Community Offering, and Syndicated Community Offering or be obligated to take any action which is inconsistent with all applicable laws, regulations, decisions or orders.

2





The obligations of the Agent pursuant to this Agreement shall terminate upon termination of the Offering, but in no event later than 45 days after the completion of the Subscription Offering, unless extended (the "End Date"). All fees or expenses due to the Agent but unpaid will be payable to the Agent in next day funds at the earlier of the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined) or the End Date. In the event the Offering is extended beyond the End Date, the Blue Hills Parties and the Agent may agree to renew this Agreement under mutually acceptable terms.

In the event the Holding Company is unable to sell a minimum of 17,850,000 Shares within the period herein provided, this Agreement shall terminate and the Holding Company shall refund to any persons who have subscribed for any of the Shares the full amount which it may have received from them plus accrued interest, as set forth in the Prospectus; and none of the parties to this Agreement shall have any obligation to the other parties hereunder, except as set forth in this Section 2 and in Sections 7, 9 and 10 hereof. In the event the Offering is terminated for any reason not attributable to the action or inaction of the Agent, the Agent shall be paid the fees due to the date of such termination pursuant to subparagraphs (a) and (e) below.

The Agent shall receive the following compensation for its services hereunder:

(a) A management fee of $50,000 payable in four installments of $12,500 on the first day of October 2013, December 2013, March 2014 and June 2014. Such fees shall be deemed to have been earned when due. Should the Offering be terminated for any reason not attributable to the action or inaction of Agent, Agent shall have earned and be entitled to be paid fees accruing through the stage at which point the termination occurred.

(b) A Success Fee of 0.85% shall be paid based on the aggregate purchase price of the Shares sold in the Subscription Offering and the Community Offering excluding shares purchased by the Blue Hills Parties' officers, directors, trustees or employees (or members of their immediate family) plus any ESOP, tax-qualified or stock based compensation plans or similar plan created by the Blue Hills Parties for some or all of their directors or employees or by the foundation (or any shares contributed to the foundation). The Management Fee described in Section 2(a) above will be credited against the Success Fee paid pursuant to this paragraph.

(c) If any of the Shares remain available after the Subscription Offering and Community Offering, at the request of the Holding Company, Agent will seek to form a syndicate of registered broker-dealers to assist in the sale of Shares on a best efforts basis, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in a selected dealers agreement to be entered into between the Holding Company and Agent. Agent will endeavor to distribute the Shares among dealers in a fashion which best meets the distribution objectives of the Holding Company and the Plan. Agent will be paid a fee not to exceed 5.25% of the aggregate Purchase Price of the Shares sold in the Syndicated Community Offering. From this fee, Agent will pass onto selected broker-dealers, who assist in the Syndicated Community Offering, an amount competitive with gross underwriting discounts charged at such time for comparable amounts of stock sold at a comparable price per share in a similar market environment. Fees with respect to purchases affected with the assistance of a broker/dealer other than Agent shall be transmitted by Agent to such broker/dealer. The decision to utilize selected broker-dealers will be made by Agent upon consultation with the Holding Company.

(d) The Holding Company may engage Agent to offer the Shares to certain members of the general public in the Underwritten Offering with Agent acting as sole book-running manager. In the event that Agent sells Shares in the Underwritten Offering, the underwriting discount will equal 5.25% of the aggregate Purchase Price of the Shares sold in the Underwritten Offering to Agent and to any other broker-dealer participating as an underwriter in the Underwritten Offering.

3





(e) If, as a result of any resolicitation of subscribers undertaken by the Holding Company, the Agent reasonably determines that it is required or requested to provide significant services, the Agent will be entitled to additional compensation for such services, which additional compensation will not exceed $50,000.

(f) The Holding Company shall reimburse the Agent for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including costs of travel, meals and lodging, photocopying, telephone, facsimile and couriers, etc. not to exceed $25,000. In addition, the Holding Company will reimburse the Agent for fees and expenses of its counsel not to exceed $100,000. In the event of unusual circumstances or delays or a re-solicitation in connection with the Offering, including in the event of a material delay in the Offering that would require an update of the financial information in tabular form to reflect a period later than that set forth in the original filing of the Registration Statement, the Agent shall be reimbursed for its additional expenses up to a maximum of $10,000 in the case of additional out-of-pocket expenses of the Agent, and up to an additional $25,000 in the case of additional fees and expenses of the Agent's counsel. The Holding Company will bear the expenses of the Offering customarily borne by issuers including, without limitation, regulatory filing fees, SEC, Blue Sky and Financial Institution Regulatory Authority ("FINRA") filing and registration fees; the fees of the Holding Company's accountants, attorneys, appraiser, transfer agent and registrar, printing, mailing and marketing and syndicate expenses associated with the Conversion and Offering; and the fees set forth under this Section 2.

Conversion Agent Services. The Agent shall also receive a fee of $50,000 for certain conversion agent services set forth in the letter agreement, dated October 7, 2013, among the MHC, the Mid-Tier, the Bank and the Agent (a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit B), $10,000 of which has already been paid to the Agent and is nonrefundable and the balance of which shall be payable to the Agent upon completion of the Offering. The Holding Company will reimburse the Agent, upon request made from time to time, for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with its conversion agent services not to exceed $25,000 without the consent of the Blue Hills Parties. However, in the event of unusual circumstances, delays or a re-solicitation in connection with the offering, the total fees paid to the Agent may be increased by an additional amount not to exceed $10,000.

Section 3. Sale and Delivery of Shares. If all conditions precedent to the consummation of the Conversion, including without limitation, the sale of all Shares required by the Plan to be sold, are satisfied, the Holding Company agrees to issue, or have issued, the Shares sold in the Offering and to release for delivery certificates for such Shares on the Closing Date against payment to the Holding Company by any means authorized by the Plan; provided, however, that no funds shall be released to the Holding Company until the conditions specified in Section 8 hereof shall have been complied with to the reasonable satisfaction of the Agent or its counsel. The release of Shares against payment therefor shall be made on a date and at a place acceptable to the Blue Hills Parties and the Agent as set forth in Section 14. Certificates for shares shall be delivered directly to the purchasers in accordance with their directions as provided by the Holding Company to the Holding Company's registrar and transfer agent. The date upon which the Holding Company shall release or deliver the Shares sold in the Offering, in accordance with the terms herein, is called the "Closing Date."

(s) Each of the Blue Hills Parties has all such power, authority, authorizations, approvals and orders as may be required to enter into this Agreement, to carry out the provisions and conditions hereof and to issue and sell the Shares to be sold by the Holding Company as provided herein and as described in the Prospectus, subject to approval or confirmation by the Division or any other applicable regulator of the final Appraisal. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions herein contemplated have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of each of the Blue Hills Parties. This Agreement has been validly executed and delivered by each of the Blue Hills Parties and, assuming due execution and delivery by the Agent, is the valid, legal and binding agreement of each of the Blue Hills Parties enforceable in accordance with its terms (except as the enforceability thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar laws relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally or the rights of creditors of bank holding companies, the accounts of whose subsidiaries are insured by the FDIC, or by general equity principles, regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law, and except to the extent, if any, that the provisions of Sections 9 and 10 hereof may be unenforceable as against public policy or pursuant to applicable Federal law and the rules and regulations of the FRB).

(t) None of the Blue Hills Parties is in violation of any directive received from the FRB, the Division or the FDIC to make any material change in the method of conducting its business so as to comply in all material respects with all applicable statutes and regulations (including, without limitation, regulations, decisions, directives and orders of the FRB, the Division or the FDIC) and, except as may be set forth in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, there is no suit or proceeding or charge or action before or by any court, regulatory authority or governmental agency or body, pending or, to the knowledge of any of the Blue Hills Parties, threatened, which might materially and adversely affect the Offering, or which might result in any Material Adverse Effect.

The other financial, statistical and pro forma information and related notes included in the Prospectus present fairly the information shown therein on a basis consistent with the audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Blue Hills Parties included in the Prospectus, and as to the pro forma adjustments, the adjustments made therein have been properly applied on the basis described therein.

To the knowledge of the Blue Hills Parties, there are no events or circumstances that could form the basis of an order for clean-up or remediation, or an action, suit or proceeding by any private party or governmental body or agency, against or affecting the Blue Hills Parties relating to any Environmental Law. For purposes of this subsection, the term "Environmental Law" means any federal, state, local or foreign law, statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, code, license, permit, authorization, approval, consent, order, judgment, decree, injunction or agreement with any regulatory authority relating to (i) the protection, preservation or restoration of the environment (including, without limitation, air, water, vapor, surface water, groundwater, drinking water supply, surface soil, subsurface soil, plant and animal life or any other natural resource), and/or (ii) the use, storage, recycling, treatment, generation, transportation, processing, handling, labeling, production, release or disposal of any substance presently listed, defined, designated or classified as hazardous, toxic, radioactive or dangerous, or otherwise regulated, whether by type or by quantity, including any material containing any such substance as a component.

To the knowledge of the Blue Hills Parties, Wolf & Co., P.C. and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors have been advised of: (A) any significant deficiency or material weakness in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which could adversely affect the Blue Hills Parties' ability to record, process, summarize, and report financial data; and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the Blue Hills Parties' internal accounting controls.

The Holding Company authorizes the Agent to use the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented, if amended or supplemented) in any lawful manner contemplated by the Plan in connection with the sale of the Shares by the Agent.

(i) The Blue Hills Parties will comply with any and all terms, conditions, requirements and provisions with respect to the Offering imposed by the Commission, the Division or any other applicable regulator or the Massachusetts Regulations and by the 1933 Act, the 1933 Act Regulations, the 1934 Act and the 1934 Act Regulations to be complied with prior to or subsequent to the Closing Date and when the Prospectus is required to be delivered, and during such time period the Blue Hills Parties will comply, at their own expense, with all requirements imposed upon them by the Commission, the Division or any other applicable regulator or the Massachusetts Regulations, and by the 1933 Act, the 1933 Act Regulations, the 1934 Act and the 1934 Act Regulations, including, without limitation, Rule 10b-5 under the 1934 Act, in each case as from time to time in force, so far as necessary

For the purpose of this Agreement, the Holding Company will timely furnish to the Agent such information with respect to the Blue Hills Parties as the Agent may from time to time reasonably request.

24





(j) At the Closing Date, the Agent shall receive a letter dated the Closing Date, addressed to the Agent, confirming the statements made by Wolf & Co., P.C. in the letter delivered by it pursuant to subsection (i) of this Section 8, the "specified date" referred to in clause (ii) of subsection (i) to be a date specified in the letter required by this subsection (j) which for purposes of such letter shall not be more than three business days prior to the Closing Date.

(n) At or prior to the Closing Date, counsel to the Agent shall have been furnished with such documents and opinions as they may reasonably require for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon the sale of the Shares as herein contemplated and related proceedings or in order to evidence the occurrence or completeness of any of the representations or warranties, or the fulfillment of any of the conditions, herein contained; and all proceedings taken by the Blue Hills Parties in connection with the sale of the Shares as herein contemplated shall be satisfactory in form and substance to the Agent or its counsel.

Section 9. Indemnification.

(a) Each of the Blue Hills Parties jointly and severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Agent, its officers and directors, employees and agents, and each person, if any, who controls the Agent within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20(a) of the 1934 Act, against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage or expense whatsoever (including, but not limited to, settlement expenses), joint or several, that the Agent or any of them may suffer or to which the Agent and any such persons may become subject under all applicable federal or state laws or otherwise, and to promptly reimburse the Agent and any such persons upon written demand for any reasonable expense (including all reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) incurred by the Agent or any of them in connection with investigating, preparing or defending any actions, proceedings or claims (whether commenced or threatened) to the extent such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions: (i) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the General Disclosure Package, any Issuer-Represented Limited-Use Free Writing Prospectus, any Issuer-Represented General Free Writing Prospectus, preliminary or final Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the Applications (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or any instrument or document executed by the Blue Hills Parties or based upon written information supplied by the Holding Company filed in any state or jurisdiction to register or qualify any or all of the Shares or to claim an exemption therefrom or provided to any state or jurisdiction to exempt the Blue Hills Parties as a broker-dealer or its officers, directors and employees as broker-dealers or agents, under the securities laws thereof (collectively, the "Blue Sky Application"), or any document, advertisement, oral statement or communication ("Sales Information") prepared, made or executed by or on behalf of the Blue Hills Parties with its consent and based upon written or oral information furnished by or on behalf of the Blue Hills Parties, whether or not filed in any jurisdiction, in order to qualify or register the Shares or to claim an exemption therefrom under the securities laws thereof; (ii) arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state in any of the foregoing documents or information a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; or (iii) arise from any theory of liability whatsoever relating to or arising from or based upon the Registration Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto), preliminary or final Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the General Disclosure Package, any Issuer­Represented Limited­Use Free Writing Prospectus, any Issuer-Represented General Free Writing Prospectus, the Applications (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Blue Sky Application or Sales Information or other documentation distributed in connection with the Conversion; provided, however, that no indemnification is required under this paragraph (a) to the extent such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions arise out of or are based upon any untrue material statement or alleged untrue material statement in, or material omission or alleged material omission from, the Registration Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto), preliminary or final Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the General Disclosure Package, any Issuer-Represented Limited-Use Free Writing Prospectus, any Issuer-Represented General Free Writing Prospectus, the Applications, any Blue Sky Application or Sales Information made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Holding Company, by the Agent or its counsel regarding the Agent, and provided, that it is agreed and understood that the only information furnished in writing to the Holding Company, by the Agent regarding the Agent is set forth in the Prospectus in the first sentence of the second paragraph under the caption "The Conversion; Plan of Distribution—Marketing and Distribution; Compensation"; and, provided further, that such indemnification shall be limited to the extent prohibited by the Commission, the FDIC, the Division and the FRB.

26





(b) The Agent agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Blue Hills Parties, their directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls the Holding Company or the Bank within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20(a) of the 1934 Act against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage or expense whatsoever (including but not limited to settlement expenses), joint or several, which they, or any of them, may suffer or to which they, or any of them may become subject under all applicable federal and state laws or otherwise, and to promptly reimburse the Blue Hills Parties, and any such persons upon written demand for any expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) incurred by them, or any of them, in connection with investigating, preparing or defending any actions, proceedings or claims (whether commenced or threatened) to the extent such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions: (i) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the Applications (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the preliminary or final Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Blue Sky Application or Sales Information, (ii) are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state in any of the foregoing documents a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or (iii) arise from any theory of liability whatsoever relating to or arising from or based upon the Registration Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto), preliminary or final Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the Applications (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or any Blue Sky Application or Sales Information or other documentation distributed in connection with the Offering; provided, however, that the Agent's obligations under this Section 9(b) shall exist only if and only to the extent that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement was made in, or such material fact or alleged material fact was omitted from, the Registration Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the preliminary or final Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the Applications (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Blue Sky Application or Sales Information in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Holding Company or the Bank, by the Agent or its counsel regarding the Agent, and provided, that it is agreed and understood that the only information furnished in writing to the Holding Company or the Bank, by the Agent regarding the Agent is set forth in the Prospectus in the first sentence of the second paragraph under the caption "The Conversion; Plan of Distribution­Marketing and Distribution; Compensation."

(c) Each indemnified party shall give prompt written notice to each indemnifying party of any action, proceeding, claim (whether commenced or threatened), or suit instituted against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have on account of this Section 9 or otherwise. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of such action. In addition, if it so elects within a reasonable time after receipt of such notice, an indemnifying party, jointly with any other indemnifying parties receiving such notice, may assume defense of such action with counsel chosen by it and approved by the indemnified parties that are defendants in such action, unless such indemnified parties reasonably object to such assumption on the ground that there may be legal defenses available to them that are different from or in addition to those available to such indemnifying party. If an indemnifying party assumes the defense of such action, the indemnifying parties shall not be liable for any fees and expenses of counsel for the indemnified parties incurred thereafter in connection with such action, proceeding or claim, other than reasonable costs of investigation. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (and any local counsel that said firm may retain) for each indemnified party in connection with any one action, proceeding or claim or separate but similar or related actions, proceedings or claims in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances.

Section 10. Contribution. In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnification provided for in Section 9 is due in accordance with its terms

27





but is for any reason held by a court to be unavailable from the Blue Hills Parties or the Agent, the Blue Hills Parties and the Agent shall contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including any investigation, legal and other expenses incurred in connection with, and any amount paid in settlement of, any action, suit or proceeding, but after deducting any contribution received by the Blue Hills Parties or the Agent from persons other than the other parties thereto, who may also be liable for contribution) in such proportion so that the Agent is responsible for that portion represented by the percentage that the fees paid to the Agent pursuant to Section 2 of this Agreement (not including expenses) bears to the gross proceeds received by the Holding Company from the sale of the Shares in the Offering, and the Blue Hills Parties shall be responsible for the balance. If, however, the allocation provided above is not permitted by applicable law, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative fault of the Blue Hills Parties on the one hand and the Agent on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions, proceedings or claims in respect thereto), but also the relative benefits received by the Blue Hills Parties on the one hand and the Agent on the other from the Offering (before deducting expenses). The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Blue Hills Parties on the one hand or the Agent on the other and the parties' relative intent, good faith, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Blue Hills Parties and the Agent agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 10 were determined by pro-rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 10. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions, proceedings or claims in respect thereof) referred to above in this Section 10 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action, proceeding or claim. It is expressly agreed that the Agent shall not be liable for any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense or be required to contribute any amount pursuant to Section 9(b) or this Section 10 which in the aggregate exceeds the amount paid (excluding reimbursable expenses) to the Agent under this Agreement. It is understood that the above stated limitation on the Agent's liability is essential to the Agent and that the Agent would not have entered into this Agreement if such limitation had not been agreed to by the parties to this Agreement. No person found guilty of any fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not found guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Blue Hills Parties under this Section 10 and under Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Holding Company and the Agent may otherwise have.
