Each Party          agrees that all of its  capacity  will comply with this  obligation  in          respect of all  capacity  which is  assigned  to that  Party.  If after          notification by the Maintenance Authorities,  the Party responsible for          such  capacity  does not take  immediate  action to prevent any further          interruption,  degradation or other negative influence, the Maintenance          Authorities  may  take any  reasonable  action  to  protect  the  other          capacity  in  TAT-14  including  the   disconnection  of  the  capacity          responsible for such interruption, degradation or adverse effect.

10.      EQUIPAGE

         Unless otherwise  decided by the Managing Group,  TAT-14 shall be fully





         equipped for 640 Gb/s to the System Interface level at the RFPA Date.

11       INCREASE OR DECREASE OF DESIGN CAPACITY

11.1     The  Managing  Group  may  decide  to  increase  the  Design  Capacity.          Following  such  a  decision,  the  Managing  Group  shall  develop  an          implementation  plan  for  and  the  terms  and  conditions  of such an          increase.  The proposed  implementation  plan and terms and  conditions          shall be submitted to the General Committee for approval.

11.2     If  subsequent  to the RFCS Date,  the  Design  Capacity  is  decreased          pursuant to the  agreement of the Managing  Group and such  decrease of          the Design Capacity affects neither the routing of circuits assigned in          TAT-14  nor the Sold  Capacity  of  TAT-14,  the  reduction  in  Design          Capacity will be subtracted  from the CRC as determined by the Managing          Group.

11.3     In the event that the capacity which TAT-14, or any Segment thereof, is          capable of providing is reduced below the capacity  required to support          the Sold  Capacity on its  existing or planned  routings as a result of          physical deterioration,  or for other reasons beyond the control of the          Parties,  the  Managing  Group shall  initiate a review of the capacity          routings in order to support the  rerouting of such Sold  Capacity.  If          necessary,  the Managing Group may further consider changes to capacity          assignments.

11.4     Financial  adjustments  shall be made among the Parties,  as necessary,          under  terms  and  conditions  recommended  by the  Managing  Group and          approved by the General Committee.

12       OWNERSHIP PRICING

12.1     The TAT-14 Initial Ownership Pricing Matrix is shown in Annex 8.

12.2     In the event that the final  cost of TAT-14 is lower  than the  initial          budget, each Party's investment shall be reduced on a pro-rata basis in          accordance  with Schedule B, with no change to its Allocated  Capacity.          If the final  cost of TAT-14 is higher  than the  initial  budget  each          Party's investment shall be increased on a pro-rata basis in accordance          with Schedule B. Schedule C shall not be affected.

         (iii)  other costs incurred under the direction of the Managing  Group,                 or the  Procurement  Group,  and those  capital  costs  directly                 incurred by the Terminal  Parties,  the CBP, the NA or any Party                 authorized  by the  Managing  Group,  which  shall  be fair  and                 reasonable in amount and not included in the Supply Contract and                 which have been directly and reasonably incurred for the purpose                 of,  or  to  be   properly   chargeable,   in  respect  of  such                 engineering, provision, construction, installation and laying of                 Segment S of  TAT-14.  Such  costs  shall  include,  but are not                 limited  to,  the  costs  of  engineering,   design,  materials,





                manufacturing, procurement and inspection, installation, removal                 (with appropriate  reduction for salvage),  cable ship and other                 ship costs,  route surveys,  burying,  testing  associated  with                 laying or installation, customs duties, taxes (except income tax                 imposed upon the net income of a Party),  appropriate  financial                 charges  attributable to other Parties' shares of costs incurred                 by the  Terminal  Parties or any other Party  authorized  by the                 Managing  Group,  at the  rate at  which  such  Party  generally                 incurred   such   financial   charges,   supervision,    billing                 activities, overheads and insurance or a reasonable allowance in                 lieu of insurance,  if such Party elects to carry a risk itself,                 being a risk against  which  insurance is usual or recognized or                 would have been  reasonable.  Such  costs  shall  include  costs                 incurred by the Parties in the holding of the Data Gathering and                 the General Committee  meetings but excluding  attendance by the                 Parties' representatives at such meetings. Such costs shall also                 include costs incurred by the Parties in holding the meetings of                 the Managing Group, the Procurement Group and its Working Groups                 and   the   preparation   and   attendance   by   the   Parties'                 representatives at such meetings.

13.2     Capital  costs shall  exclude  costs  incurred  by the Parties  holding          meetings  of the AR&R  Subcommittee  and F&A  Subcommittee  established          pursuant to Subparagraph 7.2 of this Agreement or the attendance by the          Parties' representatives at such meetings.

13.3     Any  amounts  received  by,  or  credited  to,  a Party or the CBP as a          consequence  of  letters of  guarantee,  liquidated  damages,  or other          similar  amounts  resulting  from the failure of the  Supplier to fully          perform  any  provision  of the Supply  Contract,  shall  accrue to the          benefit of all the Parties in accordance with Schedule B.

13.4     The cost of repair or replacement of any part of TAT-14 in the event of          damage or loss arising during construction, laying, burying, installing          and the bringing into operation of TAT-14,  which is attributable under          the Supply  Contract to the  Parties,  shall be regarded as part of the          capital costs for the purpose of Subparagraph  13.1. Any of the Parties          may at its own  expense  insure  against  such  risks so far as its own          share of costs is concerned. Should the Managing Group agree to jointly          insure against such risks, the cost of such insurance will form part of          the capital costs referred to in Subparagraph 13.1.

14       ALLOCATION AND BILLING OF SEGMENTS CAPITAL COSTS

14.1     The capital  costs of Segment S of TAT-14,  as defined in Paragraph 13,          including any additional  work or property  incorporated  subsequent to          the RFPA Date

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- September 2, 1998                                                        Page 17

         by  agreement  of the  Parties,  shall be borne by the  Parties  in the          proportions set forth in Schedule B.

14.2     The CBP will receive  invoices  from the Supplier for the costs due and          included in the Supply  Contract.  The Parties  shall  promptly  render          invoices to the CBP for the cost of items directly  incurred by them in          accordance with Subparagraph  13.1. The CBP shall promptly render bills          to each of the Parties for such Party's pro rata share of costs due and          included in the invoices it has received in accordance with Schedule B.          Such bills shall contain a reasonable  amount of detail to substantiate          them.  On the basis of such bills,  each Party shall pay to the CBP the          amount  owed  within  forty-five  (45)  days from the date the bill was          rendered by the CBP in the currency shown on the respective bill.

14.3     For the purpose of this Agreement, financial charges shall be computed,          as appropriate,  at a rate equal to the lowest publicly announced prime          rate  or  minimum  commercial  lending  rate,  however  described,  for          ninety-day  loans on the 1st working day of each month of the period to          be  considered  in the Country and in the currency in which the bill is          rendered.  With respect to the Parties  rendering  invoices  under this          Agreement,  Annex 7 specifies those rates. If the Managing Group should          authorize a Party in a Country other than those Parties listed in Annex          7 to render  invoices,  the Managing Group shall specify the applicable          rates.

14.4     For the  purposes of this  Agreement,  "paid" shall mean that the funds          are available for immediate use by the recipient.

14.5     Bills not paid when due shall accrue extended  payment charges from the





         day  following  the date on which  payment was due in  accordance  with          Subparagraph  14.2 until the day on which it is paid.  For the purposes          of this Agreement, extended payment charges shall be computed at a rate          equal to 150 % of the  appropriate  financial  charges as  indicated in          Subparagraph 14.3 on the day following the date payment of the bill was          due. In the event that applicable law allows the imposition of extended          payment  interest  charges only at a rate less than that established in          accordance with this Subparagraph, extended payment charges shall be at          the  highest  rate  permitted  by such  applicable  law.  In this case,          appropriate  documents to  demonstrate  the  applicability  of such law          shall be provided by the concerned Party.

14.6     Extended payment charges recovered by the CBP, in excess of the amounts          paid or due, excluding interest paid by whichever Party or Parties have          covered  the deficit in the  intervening  period,  shall  accrue to the          benefit of all the Parties in accordance with Schedule B.

14.7     Procedures for rendering  credits for refunds of appropriate  financial          charges and bills for extended payment charges will be developed by the          CBP in conjunction with the F&A Subcommittee.

14.8     As soon as practicable  after the RFPA Date, the amount of each Party's          share of the costs of Segment S shall be computed by the CBP which will          make appropriate  adjustments and render any necessary bills or arrange          for any necessary refunds by way of final settlement in order that each          Party  may  bear its  appropriate  share of the  costs as  provided  in          Subparagraph 14.1.

14.9     A bill shall be deemed to have been accepted by the Party to whom it is          rendered if that Party does not present a written  objection to the CBP          on or before  fifteen  (15) days prior to the date when payment is due.          If such  objection  is made,  the  Parties  concerned  shall make every          reasonable effort to settle promptly the dispute concerning the bill in          question.  If the  objection is sustained and the billed Party has paid          the  disputed  bill,  the agreed  upon  overpayment  shall be  refunded          promptly to the objecting  Party by the billing Party together with any          financial charges calculated thereon at a rate determined in accordance          with  Subparagraph  14.3 of this  Agreement from the date of payment of          the  bill  to the  date on  which  the  refund  is  transmitted  to the          objecting Party. If the objection is not sustained and the billed Party          has not paid the disputed bill,  said Party will pay such bill promptly          together with any extended payment charges calculated thereon at a rate          determined in accordance with  Subparagraph 14.5 of this Agreement from          the day  following  the date on which payment of the bill was due until          paid.  Nothing in this  Subparagraph  shall relieve a Party from paying          those parts of a bill that are not in dispute.  The  provisions of this          Subparagraph  shall be  without  prejudice  to the  rights of any Party          pursuant to Paragraph 21 of this Agreement.

15       TRANSIT FACILITIES TO EXTEND TAT-14 CAPACITY AND CONNECTION WITH INLAND          SYSTEMS

15.1     The Terminal  Parties shall use all  reasonable  efforts to furnish and          maintain, or cause to be furnished and maintained, in working order for          the other Parties and for the Purchasers in TAT-14, for the duration of          this Agreement,  the necessary facilities in their respective Countries          as may be reasonably required for extending capacity in TAT-14 assigned          to  such   Parties  or   Purchasers   for  the   purpose  of   handling          communications  transiting  the  Country  involved.  No Party  shall be          required under this Agreement to furnish such transit facilities in its          Country to other Parties or Purchasers of its own Country.

15.2     Such facilities  referred to in Subparagraph 15.1 shall be suitable for          extending  capacity in TAT-14 and shall be furnished and  maintained on          terms  and  conditions  which  shall be no less  favorable  than  those          granted to other ITEs for  transmission  facilities of similar type and          quantity  transiting the Country.  Such terms and conditions  shall not          override  any  applicable  governmental  laws  and  regulations  in the          Country in which the facilities are located.

15.3     Each  Terminal  Party  shall  provide,  within the Country of its Cable          Station,  connection to TAT-14 at the SDH Interface  Equipment  levels,          VC12,  VC3 or VC4  levels,  to  Parties  and  Purchasers  on terms  and          conditions  to be agreed by the  Terminal  Party and the other Party or          Purchaser under a separate agreement.

16.5     The   Maintenance   Authorities,   individually   or   collectively  as          appropriate,  shall each use all  reasonable  efforts to  maintain,  or          cause to be  maintained,  economically  the  Segments for which each is          responsible,  in efficient  working order.  Each Maintenance  Authority          shall  discharge  its   responsibility  in  a  manner  consistent  with          applicable international submarine cable maintenance practices and with          an objective of achieving effective and timely repairs when necessary.

16.6     The  Maintenance  Authorities  shall  have  the  right  to  temporarily          de-activate  Segment S, or any part thereof,  in order to perform their          duties  as  Maintenance  Authorities.   Prior  to  such  de-activation,          reasonable notice shall be given to and coordination shall be made with          the other  Parties.  To the extent  possible,  sixty (60) days prior to          initiating  action,  the  Maintenance  Authority(ies)  shall advise the          other Parties in writing of the timing, scope, and costs of significant          planned  maintenance  operations,  of  significant  changes to existing          operation and maintenance methods, and of contractual  arrangements for          cable ships that will or may have a significant  impact on operation or          maintenance costs. Should one or more Parties representing at least 5 %          of the total  voting  interests  specified in Schedule B wish to review          such an  operation  or change  prior to its  occurrence,  such Party or          Parties  shall  notify the  Maintenance  Authorities  involved  and the          Managing  Group  chairperson in writing within thirty (30) days of such          advice.  Upon such  notification,  the  Managing  Group shall  initiate          action to convene an ad hoc meeting for such review.

16.7     Each  Maintenance  Authority  shall  have  prompt  access to all system          maintenance  information,  necessary to the  performance of its duties,          appropriate to those parts of TAT-14 not covered by its authority.

16.8     No Party shall be liable to any other Party or  Purchaser  for any loss          or damage sustained by reason of any delay in provision,  failure in or          breakdown of the facilities  constituting TAT-14 or any interruption of          service,  whatsoever  shall be the cause of such failure,  breakdown or          interruption, and however long it shall last.

16.9     In the event of a failure or  breakdown of any of such  facilities,  if          the responsible Maintenance Authority fails to restore those facilities          to efficient working order and operation within a reasonable time after          having  been  called  upon  to do so by any  Party  or  Purchaser,  the          Managing  Group may, to the extent that it is practical to do so, place          or cause to be placed,  such facilities in efficient  working order and          operation and charge the Parties their proportionate shares of the cost          reasonably incurred in doing it.

16.12    The Maintenance  Authorities shall be entitled to enter into agreements          in respect of the crossing of Segment S with undersea plant (including,          but not  limited  to,  pipelines)  with the owners of such  plant.  The          Maintenance  Authorities  may sign such agreements on behalf of all the          Parties  after  agreement by the Managing  Group and shall  provide the





         Parties with copies of such agreements on request.

21       DEFAULT OF PAYMENT

21.1     If any Party fails to make any payment  required by this  Agreement  on          the date when it is due and such default  continues  for a period of at          least two (2) months  after the date when  payment  is due,  the CBP or          billing Party shall notify the billed Party in writing of its intent to          notify  the  Managing  Group of the status of the matter and to request          the  reclamation of capacity,  as provided for in this Paragraph 21, if          full  payment  is  not   received   within  four  (4)  months  of  such          notification  to the billed  Party.  If full  payment  is not  received          within such  specific  period,  the billing Party or CBP may notify the          Managing  Group  of the  status  of the  matter  and  request  that the          Managing  Group  reclaim  the  capacity  in  TAT-14   assigned  to  the          defaulting Party.

21.2     The  Managing  Group shall have the option of  reclaiming  the capacity          assigned  to a Party that is in default  with any  payment  required by          this  Agreement  or is in default  with any other  material  obligation          under this  Agreement,  if such default has existed for a period of six          (6)  months.   The  Managing  Group  shall  consider  any   extenuating          circumstances  not within the specific  control of the defaulting Party          and the  interests of any Party or Parties  that have jointly  assigned          capacity with the  defaulting  Party in  determining  whether or not to          reclaim  the  capacity  assigned  to such  defaulting  Party.  Prior to          reclaiming  the capacity  the  Managing  Group will notify the Party in          writing that it is in default and of the intent to reclaim the capacity          after one (1) month.  The Managing Group shall  determine  arrangements          for disposition of any reclaimed capacity.  The remaining Parties shall          not be  obliged  to make any  payment  to a  defaulting  Party  for the          reclaimed capacity.  Except for the rights and obligations as specified          in Paragraphs 25 and 29 the rights and obligations under this Agreement          of a defaulting  Party shall  terminate at the time the Managing  Group          reclaims all of the capacity previously assigned to a defaulting Party.          This Agreement shall be appropriately amended to reflect the default of          a Party and the  reallocation  of  interests  pursuant to  arrangements          determined by the Managing Group.

22       LIABILITY

22.1     No Party  excludes or  restricts  its  liability  for death or personal          injury  resulting  from its own  negligence.  Subject to the  preceding          sentence, no Party shall be liable to any other Party in contract, tort          or otherwise including any liability for negligence for any indirect or          consequential loss or damage including, without limitation,  corruption          or loss of data,  loss of profit,  loss of  anticipated  savings all in          connection with this Agreement,  caused by its own acts or those of any          of its auxiliaries, such as employees, servants or agents. Furthermore,          no Party  shall be  liable  to any  other  Party in  contract,  tort or          otherwise for any direct damage unless and to the extent it is based on          intent or gross negligence. In no event shall any employee,  servant or          agent of a Party be  liable to  another  Party  for any  negligence  or          intent in connection with this Agreement.

24.3     If any claim is brought  against  one or more  Parties  it shall,  as a          condition of reimbursement under Subparagraph 24.2, give written notice          thereof  to the  Managing  Group as soon as  practicable  and shall not          admit liability nor settle,  adjust or compromise the claim without the          approval of the Managing Group.
