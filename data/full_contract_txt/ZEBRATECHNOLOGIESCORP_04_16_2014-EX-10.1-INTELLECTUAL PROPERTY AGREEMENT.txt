ARTICLE II ASSIGNMENTS AND LICENSES

Section 2.1 Transferred IP.

(a) Acquired Company IP. For the avoidance of doubt, the Purchaser Group will acquire all Acquired Company IP by virtue of the acquisition by the Purchaser Group of the Acquired Company Shares pursuant to the terms of the Acquisition Agreement.   13





(b) Assignment of Assigned IP.

(i) Assignment. Effective as of the applicable Closing Date, the Seller hereby sells, assigns, transfers, conveys and delivers all of its right, title, and interest in and to the Assigned IP (together with the goodwill of the business symbolized by any Trademarks that constitute Assigned IP) and all Ancillary IP Rights with respect thereto, and shall cause the other Seller Parties to do the same, to the Purchaser Assignees and, effective as of the applicable Closing Date, the Purchaser Assignees hereby purchase, acquire and accept the same from the Seller Parties. The Seller hereby waives (and shall cause the other Seller Parties to waive) any moral rights, including rights of attribution, integrity, and disclosure, arising from all or any part of any Copyrights that constitute Assigned IP, together with all claims for damages and other remedies asserted on the basis of moral rights, and hereby sells, assigns, transfers, conveys, and delivers (and shall cause the other Seller Parties to do the same) to the Purchaser Assignees any waivers granted to any Seller Party of any such moral rights.

(ii) Mandatory Laws. If and to the extent that, as a matter of Law in any jurisdiction, ownership, title, or any rights or interest in or to any of the Assigned IP cannot be assigned as provided in Section 2.1(b)(i), (A) the Seller irrevocably agrees to (and shall cause the other Seller Parties to) assign and transfer, and the Seller hereby assigns and transfers (and shall cause the other Seller Parties to assign and transfer) to the Purchaser Assignees all rights (including all economic and commercialization rights) that can be assigned pursuant to Section 2.1(b)(i) to the fullest extent permissible, and (B) the Seller hereby grants to the Purchaser Assignees, and hereby agrees to cause the other Seller Parties to grant to the Purchaser Assignees, an unlimited, exclusive, irrevocable, assignable, transferable, sublicenseable, worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free, fully-paid up license to use, exploit, and commercialize in any manner now known or in the future discovered and for whatever purpose, any and all rights to Assigned IP that cannot be assigned as contemplated by Section 2.1(b)(i).

(iii) Patent Review Process.

(A) Information Exchange. Within forty-five (45) days after the Effective Date, Seller shall provide (I) to the Purchaser, an updated list of all Patents (other than those set forth on Schedule 1.1(l) of the Seller IPA Disclosure Schedule) owned by any Seller Party that (x) have an effective filing date or are based on an invention disclosure having a date of disclosure that is on or after January 9, 2007, and (y) that name as inventors, in Seller's reasonable, good-faith belief, one or more Business Employees and one or more Persons that are not Business Employees (the "Patent Review List"), and (II) to the Invention Disclosure Review Team, a list of invention disclosures (other than those set forth on Schedule 1.1(l) of the Seller IPA Disclosure Schedule or Schedule 1.1(j)) owned by any Seller Party that name as contributors one or more Business Employees   14





and one or more Persons that are not Business Employees (which list shall include the contributors, the title thereof, and the "location code" therefor) (the "Invention Disclosure Review List"). The Patent Review List shall include the Patents set forth on Schedule 2.1(b)(iii)(A).

(B) Patent Review and Ownership. The parties shall promptly review the Patent Review List and, in good-faith, discuss and negotiate during the Review Period whether any of the Patents listed on such Patent Review List (each, a "Shared Review Patent") should be or should have been, as applicable, an Assigned Patent, based upon the general guideline and principle that Shared Review Patents that are primarily paid for, primarily used by, or primarily arising out of, or for which associated costs and fees were primarily allocated to, the Business or any Acquired Company (as compared with the Seller Business) should be or should have been, as applicable, Assigned Patents. Seller shall provide to Purchaser, upon Purchaser's reasonable request during the Review Period, information regarding such Patent Review List, the Patents listed thereon, and each such determination. If the parties agree, during the Review Period, that a Shared Review Patent should be or should have been, as applicable, an Assigned Patent, then, if such agreement was reached on or prior to the Initial Closing Date, the parties shall add such Shared Review Patent to Schedule 1.1(l) of the Seller IPA Disclosure Schedule and, if such agreement was reached after the Initial Closing Date, Seller shall (and shall cause the other Seller Parties to) promptly execute a Contract containing a present grant of assignment (or, if and to the extent, as a matter of Law in any jurisdiction, ownership, title, or any rights or interest in or to any such Shared Review Patent cannot be so assigned, a license) of such Shared Review Patent to the Purchaser Assignees, consistent with the terms and conditions of Section 2.1(b)(i) or Section 2.1(b)(ii), as applicable. If the parties cannot agree on whether any Shared Review Patent should be or should have been, as applicable, an Assigned Patent, the parties shall, during the Review Period, escalate such dispute to successively more senior-levels of executives and shall each make sure each such senior executive is promptly available to speak with (including by telephone) his or her counterpart.

(C) Invention Disclosure Review and Ownership. During the Review Period, within seventy-five (75) days after the Effective Date (or, in the event of any repeat of the process set forth in this Section 2.1(b)(iii)(C) in accordance with Section 2.1(b)(iii)(D), promptly (and no later than seventy-five (75) days) thereafter), Seller shall cause (on and prior to the Initial Closing Date), or the parties shall each cause (following the Initial Closing Date), as applicable, their respective employees on the Invention Disclosure Review Team to: (I) promptly review the Invention Disclosure Review List; (II) in good-faith determine whether any of the invention disclosures (and inventions listed on the Invention Disclosure Review List (and inventions described therein))   15





(each, a "Shared Review Invention Disclosure") should be or should have been, as applicable, Assigned Know-How, based upon the general guideline and principle that Shared Review Invention Disclosures that are primarily paid for, primarily used by, or primarily arising out of, or for which associated costs and fees were primarily allocated to, the Business or any Acquired Company (as compared with the Seller Business) should be Assigned Know-How; and (III) provide to Purchaser the applicable Invention Disclosure Review List and such determinations of the Invention Disclosure Review Team with respect to such Invention Disclosure Review List.

Seller shall provide to Purchaser, upon Purchaser's reasonable request during the Review Period, information regarding such Invention Disclosure Review List, the invention disclosures listed thereon, and each such determination; provided, however, that Seller shall not be required to disclose to Purchaser the content of any Shared Review Invention Disclosure in response to any such request. Upon review of such determinations or information, as applicable, the parties shall promptly jointly review such determinations and information, during the Review Period, and determine, in good faith, whether the Invention Disclosure Review Team should re-review any Shared Review Invention Disclosures on such Invention Disclosure Review List and, if so, the parties shall repeat the process set forth in this Section 2.1(b)(iii)(C) with respect to such Shared Review Invention Disclosures. If the Invention Disclosure Review Team determines, during the Review Period, that a Shared Review Invention Disclosure should be or should have been, as applicable, Assigned Know- How, then, if such agreement was reached on or prior to the Initial Closing Date, the parties shall add such Shared Review Invention Disclosure to Schedule 1.1(j) and, if such agreement was reached after the Initial Closing Date, Seller shall (and shall cause the other Seller Parties to) promptly execute a Contract containing a present grant of assignment (or, if and to the extent, as a matter of Law in any jurisdiction, ownership, title, or any rights or interest in or to any such Shared Review Invention Disclosure cannot be so assigned, a license) of such Shared Review Invention Disclosure to the Purchaser Assignees, consistent with the terms and conditions of Section 2.1(b)(i) or Section 2.1(b)(ii), as applicable.

(D) Newly Identified Business Employee. If, during the Review Period, the Purchaser identifies a Person ("New Business Employee") that the Purchaser reasonably believes, in good faith, is or was a Business Employee and (I) such New Business Employee is not named as a contributor on any Shared Review Invention Disclosure on an Invention   16





Disclosure Review List and is not named as an inventor on any Shared Review Patent on a Patent Review List, in each case previously provided to the Purchaser, or (II) Purchaser reasonably believes, in good faith, that Seller has not provided a complete and accurate Invention Disclosure Review List or Patent Review List with respect to any Patents or invention disclosures for which such New Business Employee is named as an inventor or contributor, respectively, then in each case of clauses (I) and (II), the Purchaser may notify Seller of such belief, and Seller shall promptly (but in no event more than thirty (30) days following such notice) provide to the Purchaser or the Invention Disclosure Review Team, as applicable, an updated Patent Review List and Invention Disclosure Review List with respect to such New Business Employee, and the parties shall repeat the process set forth in Section 2.1(b)(iii)(B) and Section 2.1(b)(iii)(C) with respect to such updated Patent Review List and Invention Disclosure Review List, respectively.

(E) Inventors Are All Business Employees. If (i) during the Review Period, Purchaser identifies a Patent or invention disclosure owned by any Seller Party where all of the inventors of such Patent or all of the contributors of such Invention Disclosure, respectively, are Business Employees, and (ii) Purchaser provides to Seller the evidence on which Purchaser is basing such identification, then such Patent or Invention Disclosure shall be an Assigned Patent or Assigned Know-How, as applicable, and the parties shall, where applicable on or prior to the Initial Closing Date, add such Patent or invention disclosure, as applicable, to Schedule 1.1(l) of the Seller IPA Disclosure Schedule or Schedule 1.1(j), as applicable, or, where applicable after the Initial Closing Date, Seller shall (and shall cause the other Seller Parties to) promptly execute a Contract containing a present grant of assignment (or, if and to the extent, as a matter of Law in any jurisdiction, ownership, title, or any rights or interest in or to any such Patent or Invention Disclosure, as applicable, cannot be so assigned, a license) of such Patent or Invention Disclosure, as applicable, to the Purchaser Assignees, consistent with the terms and conditions of Section 2.1(b)(i) or Section 2.1(b)(ii), as applicable.

(F) Arbitration. Attached as Schedule 2.1(b)(iii)(F) is a schedule of additional Patents provided by Seller to Purchaser prior to the Effective Date for review with respect to ownership allocation between the parties pursuant to the general guidelines and principles set forth in Section 2.1(b)(iii)(B) (the "Additional Patents"). The parties shall promptly, in good- faith, discuss and negotiate whether any of the Additional Patents should be or should have been, as applicable, an Assigned Patent. If any of such Additional Patents are not reviewed, or the parties cannot agree on whether any Additional Patent should be or should have been, as applicable, an Assigned Patent, prior to the Initial Closing Date, then the parties shall escalate such dispute to successively more senior-levels of executives as set forth in Section 2.1(b)(iii)(B). If such senior-levels of executives cannot resolve the dispute with respect to any such Patents (the "Outstanding Patents") by the Initial Closing Date, then either party may, within thirty (30) days after the Initial Closing Date,   17





submit such Outstanding Patents for dispute resolution as follows. One or both parties may, within thirty (30) days after the Initial Closing Date, submit the dispute with respect to such Outstanding Patents for arbitration in Chicago, Illinois before a single arbitrator. The arbitration shall be administered by JAMS pursuant to JAMS' Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures, as those Rules may be amended by written agreement of the parties. The parties shall cooperate, in good faith, prior to the commencement of any arbitration under this Section 2.1(b)(iii)(F), to agree to any such amendments or other processes with respect to such arbitration (e.g., timing of the arbitration, arbitrator's familiarity with patent law). The parties shall instruct the arbitrator, and the arbitrator shall resolve each dispute regarding the ownership of each Outstanding Patent, based upon the general guideline and principle that such Outstanding Patents that are primarily paid for, primarily used by, or primarily arising out of, or for which associated costs and fees were primarily allocated to, the Business or any Acquired Company (as compared with the Seller Business) should be or should have been, as applicable, Assigned Patents. The parties shall maintain the confidential nature of all information, documents and materials disclosed and statements made in connection with any negotiations or arbitration proceeding, and any arbitration proceeding and the judgment, including any hearing or award, except as may be necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits. The parties shall each bear their respective costs and expenses with respect to any arbitration pursuant to this Section 2.1(b)(iii)(F); provided, however, that the parties shall equally share (on a 50/50 basis) the cost of the arbitrator. If the arbitrator determines that any Outstanding Patent should be or should have been, as applicable, an Assigned Patent, Seller shall (and shall cause the other Seller Parties to) assign such Patent to the Purchaser Assignees in accordance with Section 2.1(b)(iii)(E).

(c) License-Back of Patents. Effective as of the Initial Closing Date, the Purchaser will cause each Acquired Company and each Purchaser Assignee to grant, following each applicable Closing Date, to the Seller Parties, an irrevocable (except as expressly set forth herein), perpetual, non-sublicenseable (except as expressly set forth herein), fully paid-up, royalty-free, worldwide, non-transferable (except as expressly set forth herein), non-exclusive license, under the Acquired Company Patents and Assigned Patents:

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 2.1(d) shall not constitute a license to Trademarks.

(e) Seller Excluded Products. The licenses granted pursuant to Section 2.1(c)(i), Section 2.1(c)(ii), Section 2.1(d)(i), and Section 2.1(d)(ii) do not extend to any product, system, or service if and solely to the extent such product, system, or service constitutes or includes a Seller Excluded Product; provided, that if any such Seller Excluded Product is a Type of Enterprise Mobile Computing Product, then if and solely to the extent that such Seller Excluded Product is a Permitted Type of Enterprise Mobile Computing Product, such licenses will extend solely to such Permitted Type of Enterprise Mobile Computing Product that constitutes such product, system, or service or, as included in such product, system, or service, is included in such product, system, or service, as applicable. By way of example, if a Seller Excluded Product is a single component of a product, system, or service that is otherwise licensed under Section 2.1(c)(i), Section 2.1(c)(ii), Section 2.1(d)(i), or Section 2.1(d)(ii) and such Seller Excluded Product is not a Permitted Type of Enterprise Mobile Computing Product, such licenses do not extend to such component, but such licenses do extend to the remainder of such licensed product, system, or service.

By way of example, if a Purchaser Excluded Product is a single component of a product, system, or service that is otherwise licensed under Section 2.2(a), Section 2.2(b), or Section 2.2(c), such licenses do not extend to such component, but such licenses do extend to the remainder of such licensed product, system, or service.

(f) Sublicenses. Each Purchaser Licensee may grant sublicenses of the licenses granted to it pursuant to Section 2.2: (i) to any (for the avoidance of doubt, and without limiting any other provision of this IP Agreement, current or future) direct or indirect Subsidiary of Purchaser (but only for so long as such Person remains such a Subsidiary); (ii) to any other Person in connection with the sale or disposition of substantially all of the assets of a business or product line of any Purchaser Licensee; (iii) other than with respect to Section 2.2(a), for the purpose of any Person's (including resellers, distributors, and OEMs) distribution of products licensed under Section 2.2; (iv) other than with respect to Section 2.2(a), to any Person (including OEMs, JDMs, suppliers, contractors, and subcontractors) solely for the purpose of, and to the extent necessary for, such Person to perform any service (including any service with respect to the design, manufacture, import, export, or supply of any product, service, or system in the Business or any components thereof) for a Purchaser Licensee, and not for the direct benefit of such Person or any other Person, (v) other than with respect to Section 2.2(a), to a customer of a Purchaser Licensee for such customer's use of a product licensed under Section 2.2; or (vi) other than with respect to Section 2.2(a), with respect to Software, to any Person for the purpose of such Person's development of Software that is compatible or interoperates with a product licensed under Section 2.2. The Purchaser Licensees have no other right to grant sublicenses under any of the licenses granted to the Purchaser Licensees under this Section 2.2.

(g) Acknowledgement. The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the licenses granted under this Section 2.2 do not extend to Purchaser or any product, system or service manufactured, sold, designed, distributed, or supported by Purchaser directly or indirectly through any Purchaser Licensee, other than any Business Activities for Seller Excluded Products or Smart Sensing Network Equipment.   24





Section 2.3 Delivery.

(a) Documentation. To the extent in the possession or under the control of any Seller Party, the Seller shall provide (and shall cause the other Seller Parties to provide) to the Purchaser: (i) promptly after the Initial Closing Date, complete and accurate copies of all the following that constitute Transferred IP: file histories and notes (where such notes are regarding, with respect to Transferred IP, actual or potential disclosure dates or prior art dates, standards-essential Patents, or license or covenants not to sue granted to any Person with respect to such Transferred IP) from the Seller Parties' docketing systems of the pending Patent applications and issued Patents (and invention disclosures, if any, for all such applications and Patents that any Seller Party is able to provide using Reasonable Efforts), pending Trademark applications and Trademark registrations, Copyright applications and Copyright registrations, and unpublished Patent applications; (ii) within thirty (30) days after the Effective Date, for Transferred IP throughout the world, a list of the names, addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers of prosecution counsel and agents; (iii) within thirty (30) days after the Effective Date, a list of all actions that must be taken for Transferred IP throughout the world (a "Transferred IP Docket") within one hundred eighty (180) days after the Effective Date (including the payment of any registration, maintenance, or renewal fees or the filing of any documents, corrections, or replies to any Governmental Entity, applications or certificates, for the purposes of prosecuting, maintaining, or renewing any such registered, issued, or applied-for Transferred IP); and (iv) at least on a monthly basis during the period of time from the Effective Date until the Initial Closing Date, reasonable access to the docketing information (with respect to such Transferred IP) generated by any Seller Party in the Ordinary Course consistent with how such Seller Party generates such information for itself. As of the Initial Closing Date, the Purchaser assumes all responsibility for the prosecution, maintenance and enforcement of the Transferred IP assigned under this IP Agreement as of the Initial Closing Date to a Purchaser Assignee, and the payment of all fees, and all other prosecution and maintenance activities associated with such Transferred IP. After the Effective Date, Seller shall (and shall cause the other Seller Parties to) cooperate and assist Purchaser in good faith with respect to: (A) providing information to Purchaser that is reasonably sufficient to allow Purchaser to understand prosecution, maintenance, renewal, and new filing activities with respect to the Transferred IP that occur or will occur between the Effective Date and the Initial Closing Date; and (B) providing written instructions to all prosecution counsel and agents throughout the world who are responsible for the Transferred IP to instruct such counsel and agents that Purchaser and the Purchaser Assignees will be responsible for the Transferred IP as of the Initial Closing Date and that all reasonably necessary steps should be taken to prevent the loss of any rights embodied by the Transferred IP unless such counsel and agents have received express written instructions to the contrary from Purchaser.

(b) Obligation to Deliver Technology. Following the Initial Closing Date, to the extent in the possession or under the control of any Seller Party and to the extent not   25





contained in storage media that constitutes an Acquired Asset and is delivered to the Purchaser, the Seller shall (and shall cause the other Seller Parties to), upon the Purchaser's reasonable request, use Reasonable Efforts to provide the Purchaser with all materials, Software, information, tangible embodiments, and other tangible things, as those terms have been interpreted pursuant to any applicable Laws governing the production of documents and things, constituting, comprising, related to, or necessary to practice the Transferred IP or Licensed IP. To the extent that such materials, Software, information, tangible embodiments, and other tangible things constitute, comprise or relate to any Intellectual Property licensed to Seller under Section 2.1(c) or Section 2.1(d) or the Licensed IP, the Seller shall be permitted to retain a reasonable number of copies of such documents, materials, Software, information, tangible embodiments, and other tangible things. Purchaser shall use Reasonable Efforts to inform Seller of the locations of any such materials, Software, information, tangible embodiments, and other tangible things requested by Purchaser, where Purchaser has actual knowledge of such locations.

Section 2.4 General Intellectual Property Provisions.

(a) Termination of Third Party Contracts. The license rights granted to the Purchaser Licensees under any Licensed IP that constitutes Third-Party Intellectual Property, if any, are subject to the terms and conditions of the Contracts applicable to such Licensed IP, and will terminate upon (i) termination of such Contracts, or (ii) termination of the Seller Parties' right to sublicense the Purchaser Licensees under such Contracts, in each case by the applicable third party licensor or sublicensor, as applicable (and not by a Seller Party).

(b) Compliance with Third Party Contracts. Following the Initial Closing Date, the Purchaser shall cause the Purchaser Licensees and its and their employees, contractors and agents to, comply with the terms and conditions of any such Contracts that are listed on Schedule 2.4(b) to the extent such terms and conditions are applicable to the Third-Party Intellectual Property sublicense rights granted to the Purchaser Licensees pursuant to this IP Agreement; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not require any Purchaser Licensee (or any current or future Affiliate thereof) or any of their respective employees, contractors, or agents (i) to pay or otherwise be responsible for any direct or indirect amounts, fees, charges, costs, or other consideration to any Person or (ii) to grant any license (or covenant not to sue) with respect to any Intellectual Property, in each case of clauses (i) and (ii) with respect to any such Contract.

(c) No Implied Rights. The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that, except as expressly set forth in Section 2.1 and Section 2.2 of this IP Agreement, (i) the Purchaser Licensees are not obtaining any rights in or to any Seller IP or Retained Seller Trademarks under this IP Agreement, and (ii) nothing in this IP Agreement confers on the Purchaser Licensees any right to use any name of any Seller Party in any advertising, publicity or other promotional activities; provided, however, that notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this IP Agreement, the Purchaser Licensees and any of their current or future Affiliates may make factual, non-trademark use of Seller's and the other Seller Parties' full corporate names in order to fairly and accurately describe the history of the Business. Nothing herein prohibits such Purchaser Licensees and such   26





Affiliates from maintaining books and records containing documents of files marked with any Retained Seller Trademarks in the Ordinary Course for archival and regulatory compliance purposes.

(d) Third-Party Trademarks. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, nothing in this IP Agreement confers on the Purchaser Licensees any right to use any Trademarks owned by any Person other than the Seller Parties. Except with respect to the Trademarks set forth on Schedule 2.4(d), following the Initial Closing Date, the Purchaser Licensees may not add any such Trademarks to any inventoried Enterprise Products of the Business existing as of the Initial Closing Date that are part of the Acquired Assets and that contain a Trademark licensed to the Seller Parties pursuant to the Mobility Trademark License without the Seller's prior written consent.

Section 2.5 Standards Organizations. The Seller or at least one other Seller Party is a member of the SDOs listed on Schedule 3.8(a) of the Seller IPA Disclosure Schedule. The Seller shall provide (and shall cause the other Seller Parties to provide) to Purchaser within ninety (90) days of the Initial Closing Date, complete and accurate copies of, any IP policies, other licensing commitments, and generally applicable member requirements that are associated with any SDO listed on Schedule 3.8(a) of the Seller IPA Disclosure Schedule and complete copies of all IP declarations, pledges, commitments, and other statements that any Seller Party has made in association with the Transferred IP, in all cases, with respect to each such copy, to the extent that Purchaser cannot obtain such copy using Reasonable Efforts and Seller is not prohibited from providing such copy to Purchaser). During the period of time between the Effective Date and the Initial Closing Date, Seller shall promptly notify Purchaser if any Seller Party becomes a member of any SDO not listed on Schedule 3.8(a) of the Seller IPA Disclosure Schedule, becomes subject to any other IP policy, licensing commitment, or generally applicable member requirement of any SDO, or submits any IP declaration, pledge, commitment, or other statement to any SDO. The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that Patents that are Transferred IP may be subject to the requirements of such SDOs. Subject to the Purchaser's receipt prior to the Initial Closing Date of such applicable IP policies, other licensing commitments, and generally applicable member requirements, the Purchaser agrees, with respect to Patents that are Transferred IP, to comply (and will cause the Purchaser Assignees to comply) with the licensing commitments imposed on members of such SDOs and to comply with any other requirements of such SDOs that are generally applicable to members thereof, to the extent Seller is required to pass such commitments or requirements on to Purchaser under its agreements with the applicable SDO.

ARTICLE III REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE SELLER

Except as specifically set forth in, or qualified by any matter set forth in, the disclosure schedules, dated as of the date of this IP Agreement and delivered by the Seller to the Purchaser (collectively, the "Seller IPA Disclosure Schedule") (it being agreed that the disclosure of any matter in any section or subsection in the Seller Disclosure Schedule, the Seller IPA Disclosure Schedule or the Seller EMA Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to have been disclosed in any other section or subsection in the Seller Disclosure Schedule to which the applicability of such   27





disclosure is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure), the Seller represents and warrants to the Purchaser as follows:

Section 3.1 Ownership. With respect to each item of Assigned IP and Acquired Company IP, respectively, such item is owned by a Seller Party or an Acquired Company, respectively, and such Seller Party or Acquired Company, respectively, has marketable title to such item. Schedules 1.1(b) and 1.1(c) of the Seller IPA Disclosure Schedule collectively set forth a complete and accurate list of all registered, issued, or applied-for Intellectual Property that constitutes Acquired Company IP and Schedules 1.1(h), 1.1(l), and 1.1(n) of the Seller IPA Disclosure Schedule collectively set forth a complete and accurate list of all registered, issued, or applied-for Intellectual Property that constitutes Assigned IP (such Acquired Company IP and Assigned IP, collectively, the "Registered Intellectual Property"). For each listed item, each of Schedule 1.1(b), 1.1(c), 1.1(h), 1.1(l), and 1.1(n) of the Seller IPA Disclosure Schedule, as applicable, indicates, as applicable, each owner of each such item of Registered Intellectual Property, the jurisdictions in which each such item of Registered Intellectual Property has been issued or registered or in which any application for such issuance or registration has been filed, the registration or application number, and the application filing or registration dates thereof. Each such item of Registered Intellectual Property is subsisting and, to the Knowledge of the Seller, valid and enforceable (except with respect to applications for Intellectual Property). A Seller Party has sufficient right, title, and interest in and to the Licensed IP to grant the licenses granted under this IP Agreement with respect thereto.

Section 3.2 Encumbrances. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.2(a) of the Seller IPA Disclosure Schedule, the Transferred IP is free and clear of any Encumbrances (other than Permitted Encumbrances and obligations under applicable SDO agreements with SDOs listed on Schedule 3.8 of the Seller IPA Disclosure Schedule) and, as of the Initial Closing Date, will be fully transferable, alienable, and licensable by the Purchaser Assignees and Acquired Companies without restriction and without payment to any Person and, except as set forth on Schedule 3.2(b) of the Seller IPA Disclosure Schedule, no Person has an option to take an assignment or license of any Transferred IP.

Section 3.3 Claims. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.3(a) of the Seller IPA Disclosure Schedule, (i) no Legal Proceeding is pending against any Seller Entity, (ii) no Legal Proceeding has been brought against any Seller Entity during the last three (3) years that was not resolved (other than pursuant to a settlement or license Contract), and (iii) no Claim has been threatened in writing against any Seller Entity during the last three (3) years (and, with respect to clause (B), was directed to the Seller Entities' Legal and Governmental Affairs group (including any member or representative thereof and any attorney of any of the Seller Entities) or of which any of them were aware), in each case of clauses (i) through (iii), (A) with respect to any infringement, misappropriation, or other violation, of any Intellectual Property of any Person (or any unfair competition or trade practices) by any Seller Entity in connection with an Enterprise Product (including by any making, having made, using, selling, offering for sale, importing, and otherwise disposing of an Enterprise Product or any services in connection therewith), including any unsolicited offers to license specifically directed (in whole or in part) to an Enterprise Product and directed to the Seller Entities' Legal and Governmental Affairs group (including any member or representative thereof and any attorney of any of the Seller Entities) or of which any of them were aware, unsolicited demands to license, or cease and desist letters, or   28





(B) challenging the enforceability, use, ownership, scope, or validity, of any Transferred IP (other than office actions issued in the ordinary course of prosecuting any pending patent or trademark application). Except as set forth on Schedule 3.3(b) of the Seller IPA Disclosure Schedule, with respect to the infringement, misappropriation, or other violation of any Transferred IP, (1) no Legal Proceeding has been brought during the last six (6) years or is pending, and (2) no Claim has been threatened in writing during the last three (3) years, against any Person by any Seller Entity. None of the Enterprise Products or Transferred IP are subject to any outstanding Order restricting or otherwise limiting the use, validity, enforceability, disposition, or exploitation thereof or any right, title, or interest of any Seller Entity with respect thereto.

Section 3.4 Material IP Contracts. Schedule 3.4 of the Seller IPA Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete and accurate list of all of the following (the "Material IP Contracts"): (i) Contracts to which any Acquired Company is a party under which (A) a Person grants to an Acquired Company a license to (or covenant not to sue with respect to) Intellectual Property in connection with the Business (the "In-bound Licenses") (provided that Seller shall not be required to list Off-the-Shelf Software Licenses and Contracts for Open Source Software), or (B) an Acquired Company grants to any Person a license to (or covenant not to sue with respect to) Intellectual Property (the "Out-bound Licenses") (provided that Seller shall not be required to so list non-exclusive licenses granted in the Ordinary Course to a (I) supplier solely for the purposes of, and to the extent necessary for, such supplier to design, manufacture and supply Enterprise Products for any Seller Entity with respect to the Business, and not for the direct benefit of such supplier or any other Person, or (II) customer solely for such customer's use of an Enterprise Product), (ii) other than In-Bound Licenses and Out-Bound Licenses set forth in Schedule 3.4(a) or Schedule 3.4(b) of the Seller IPA Disclosure Schedule, material Contracts entered into by any Seller Entity that materially adversely affect any Seller Entities' ability to own, use, transfer, license, or enforce any Transferred IP (including any sole or exclusive license grants) or that require payment of royalties with respect to any Transferred IP, and (iii) all Contracts (other than Assumed Contracts set forth on Schedule 1.1(c) of the Acquisition Agreement) entered into by any Seller Entity pursuant to which, as of the Initial Closing Date, any Acquired Company is a licensee or sublicensee of any cross-license to any Patent that claims or is alleged to claim any Wireless Standard or that is a general cross-license to any Patent, excluding any such Contracts that will expire or terminate within six (6) months after the Effective Date.

Section 3.5 Non-Infringement. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.5(a) of the Seller IPA Disclosure Schedule, the operation of the Business as currently conducted does not infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate (or constitute any unfair competition or trade practices), and has not, during the past six (6) years with respect to Patents and during the past three (3) years with respect to all other Intellectual Property, infringed, misappropriated, or otherwise violated (or constituted unfair competition or trade practices), of any Intellectual Property of any Person in any material respect; provided that the foregoing representation is limited to the Knowledge of the Seller with respect to any third party Patents to the extent they claim or are alleged to claim Wireless Standards. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.5(b) of the Seller IPA Disclosure Schedule, to the Knowledge of the Seller, no Person is infringing, misappropriating, or otherwise violating, or, within the last three (3) years, has infringed, misappropriated, or otherwise violated, any Transferred IP in any manner material to the Business.   29





Section 3.6 Employees. All Persons (including current and former employees, contractors, and consultants of any of the Seller Entities) who have conceived, created, invented, modified, improved, or developed any Intellectual Property material to, and used in or necessary for, the operation of the Business, for (or under the direction or supervision of) any Seller Entity (during the course of such employment, engagement, or Contract term therewith, as applicable) have executed and delivered to a Seller Entity, a Contract (i) providing for the non-disclosure by such Person of any trade secrets or other material confidential information of any of the Seller Entities with respect to such Intellectual Property, and (ii) providing for the assignment by way of a present grant of assignment (or, in the case of an independent contractor or consultant of (a) a Seller Entity (other than an Acquired Company), a sublicenseable license, or (b) an Acquired Company, a license) by such Person to a Seller Entity of any such Intellectual Property arising out of such Person's employment by, engagement by, or Contract with such Seller Entity, except where the failure to have such a Contract would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Business; provided, however, that the foregoing representation shall be to the Knowledge of the Seller solely with respect to any such contractor or consultant engaged by, or contracted with, a Seller Entity other than with the involvement or awareness of the Seller Entities' Legal and Governmental Affairs group (including any member or representative of and any attorney of any of the Seller Entities). No such Person has made any assertions with respect to any alleged ownership or title to any such Intellectual Property. To the Knowledge of the Seller, no such Person is in violation of any term or condition of any such Contract.

Section 3.7 Software. None of the Seller Entities (i) has delivered, licensed, released, or disclosed to any Person any of the Source Code for any Enterprise Product (other than, in the Ordinary Course to: (1) an employee of a Seller Entity, (2) a contractor or supplier of a Seller Entity solely for the purposes of, and to the extent necessary for, such contractor or supplier to develop, manufacture, and supply Enterprise Products for any Seller Entity, and not for the direct benefit of such contractor or supplier or any other Person, or (3) with respect to Source Code that is not material to the Business, a customer of a Seller Entity with respect to Enterprise Products or to any Person for the purpose of such Person's development of Software that is compatible or interoperates with an Enterprise Product, in each case of clauses (1) through (3), under written Contracts (which include confidentiality, use, and disclosure restrictions) normally used by the applicable Seller Entity to protect its own similar confidential or proprietary information (and in no event less stringent than the terms and conditions of Article V)), except as would not reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the Business, or (ii) is a party to any Contract requiring the deposit of any such Source Code with an escrow agent or escrow service (or other escrow Contract) or requiring the sharing or disclosure of any such Source Code with any Person. With respect to any Open Source Software that is or has been used by a Seller Entity in any way in connection with any Enterprise Product (including any Open Source Software that is Incorporated Into any Enterprise Product by or on behalf of a Seller Entity), the Seller Entities are and have been in compliance in all material respects with all applicable licenses with respect thereto. No Software that is governed by (or has otherwise been licensed or made available to a Seller Entity under) a Reciprocal License has been (a) Incorporated Into any Enterprise Product by or on behalf of a Seller Entity, or (b) distributed or made available to any Person in connection with the Business by any Seller Entity, in each case of clauses (a) and (b), in a manner that would or does require or condition any right to perform the activity described in clause (a) or (b) on any of clauses (i) through (v) of the definition of Reciprocal License (with   30

Each party shall (and shall cause the other members of its Group and its Affiliates to) hold the Source Code, trade secrets and other confidential information licensed to any of them under this IP Agreement in confidence, and shall protect the confidentiality thereof using at least the same degree of care that it uses to protect its own similar confidentiality or proprietary information, but in no event using less than a reasonable degree of care. Each party shall not (and shall cause the other members of its Group and its Affiliates not to) (i) disclose any such Source Code, trade secrets, or confidential information to any Person other than to (a) those of its employees who have a "need to know," or (b) other third Persons (including customers, suppliers, prospective suppliers, or joint developers), or (ii) use or disclose such Source Code, trade secrets and other confidential information except as necessary to exercise its rights or perform its obligations under this IP Agreement in accordance with any applicable restrictions or obligations with respect thereto, in each case of clauses (i) and (ii), under written Contracts (which include confidentiality, use, and disclosure restrictions) normally used by such party to protect its own similar confidential or proprietary information (and in no event less stringent than the terms and conditions of this Article V). This Article V will not apply to Source Code, trade secrets, or other confidential information of a party or any other member of its Group or any of its Affiliates where the other party can demonstrate such Source Code, trade secrets, or other confidential information (A) is or becomes generally known to the public or enters the public domain, other than as a result of a breach of this IP Agreement by such other party or a member of its Group or its Affiliates, (B) was rightfully disclosed to such other party or a member of its Group or its Affiliates by a third Person provided that such other party or member complies with the restrictions imposed by the third Person, or (C) was developed independently by such other party or member or Affiliate without use of or reference to any information disclosed to any of them by such party. If a party or any of members of its Group or its Affiliates is legally required to disclose any of the other party's Source Code, trade secrets, or other confidential information in connection with any legal proceeding, such party shall promptly notify the other party of the foregoing so that the other party may seek to prevent such disclosure or obtain the entry of a protective order or other appropriate protective device or procedure. The disclosing party shall fully cooperate with and aid such other party in connection with the foregoing. If a protective order or other protective device satisfactory to such other party is not obtained, the disclosing party or its applicable member will disclose only that portion of such Source Code, trade secrets, or other confidential information that is legally required to be disclosed (and will notify the other party of which portions are disclosed). Each party shall take steps reasonable under the circumstances to protect the confidentiality of all Source Code, trade secrets, and other confidential information licensed under this IP Agreement by it or its Affiliates to the other party or a member of its Group or any of its Affiliates.   34





ARTICLE VI GENERAL PROVISIONS

Section 6.1 Remedies. The sole and exclusive remedy for any breach of this IP Agreement, including the representations and warranties and covenants herein, shall be as set forth in Article 8 of the Acquisition Agreement. The representations and warranties and covenants contained herein shall terminate in accordance with Section 8.4 of the Acquisition Agreement

Section 6.2 Assignment. Neither party may assign (whether by operation of law or otherwise) this IP Agreement, or any of its licenses, rights, privileges or obligations hereunder, without the prior written consent of the other party, and any such attempted assignment shall be void; provided, however, that, following the Initial Closing Date, without any such prior written consent but upon prior written notice to the other party, each party may assign this IP Agreement to: (i) an Affiliate; (ii) a lender for collateral security; (iii) a Person that succeeds to all or substantially all of its business or assets to which this IP Agreement relates in connection with a merger or sale of all or substantially all of its assets to which this IP Agreement relates; or (iv) corporate reorganization of the party in which the ultimate ownership of the party immediately prior to such reorganization is the same as the ultimate ownership of the party immediately after such reorganization. If a Seller Party assigns or transfers any Licensed IP, the Seller shall (or shall cause the applicable Seller Party to) expressly condition such assignment or transfer on the express acknowledgement and agreement of the assignee or transferee that all such Licensed IP is bound by the license grants set forth herein. If Purchaser or a Purchaser Assignee assigns or transfers any Intellectual Property licensed to the Seller Parties pursuant to Section 2.1(c) or Section 2.1(d), the Purchaser shall (or shall cause the applicable Purchaser Assignee to) expressly condition such assignment or transfer on the express acknowledgement and agreement of the assignee or transferee that all such Intellectual Property is bound by such license grants. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this IP Agreement, Article III may only be assigned by a party (and shall be assigned by a party) together with such party's assignment of the Acquisition Agreement in accordance with the terms and conditions thereof. Subject to the foregoing limitations, this IP Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

Section 6.3 Effect of Merger or Change of Control. Upon a merger or change of control of a party (including, for purposes of this Section 6.3, with respect to Purchaser any Purchaser Licensee and with respect to Seller any Seller Party) (a "Change of Control Event") with or to a Person (other than a Person that is a then-current Affiliate of such party) (the "Buyer"), the license rights granted under Article II to such party shall not extend to the Buyer or any of its Affiliates existing immediately prior to the Change of Control Event or any of its or their past, current, or future products, systems or services. If as a result of the Change of Control Event such party remains a separate, independent legal entity (or is merged into another Person, where such Person was formed or created for the purpose of the Change of Control Event or where such Person is a then-current Affiliate of such party), then the license rights granted to such party under Article II shall continue in full force and effect. If as a result of the Change of Control Event such party is merged into the Buyer (other than if the Buyer is formed or created for the purpose of the Change of Control Event) or another Person (other than if such Person is formed or created for the purpose of the Change of Control Event or if such Person is a then-   35





current Affiliate of such party) or otherwise does not remain a separate, independent legal entity (except if such party is merged into another Person, where such Person was formed or created for the purpose of the Change of Control Event or where such Person is a then-current Affiliate of such party), then (i) the license rights granted to such party under Article II shall be limited to the operation of the business and the products, systems, and services (including Smart Sensing Network Equipment and Public Safety LTE Smartphone Devices, as applicable) of such party existing as of the effective date of the Change of Control Event and Derivative Works and natural evolutions thereof (but, in all cases, with respect to such license rights, subject to Section 2.1(e) or Section 2.2(e), as applicable), and (ii) no rights or licenses granted to such party under Article II may be extended to the Buyer or any of its Affiliates existing immediately prior to the Change of Control Event in connection with any of its or their past, current, or future products, systems or services.

Section 6.4 Acquisitions. If either party acquires a business or a Person that conducts a business covering any of the same products, systems, or services as those covered by any license granted under Article II to such acquiring party (a "Future Acquisition") (whether in an asset or equity transaction), any such license shall be deemed to apply to such same products, systems, and services (but no other products, systems or services) of such acquired business or Person; provided, that all Patents acquired in connection with such Future Acquisition are licensed to the non-acquiring party and, in the case of Seller, the Seller Parties or, in the case of Purchaser, the Purchaser Licensees, pursuant to the terms and conditions of this IP Agreement. In such event, any such acquired Person shall be deemed a Seller Party or a Purchaser Licensee hereunder, as the case may be.

Section 6.5 Further Assurances. Each of the parties agrees that from time to time, at the reasonable request and expense of the other party, it shall execute and deliver such other documents and take such other actions as the other party may reasonably request to effectuate the transactions contemplated by this IP Agreement (including any short form documentation evidencing the licenses granted by any Seller Party hereunder or other documentation to perfect or record the rights granted hereunder in the Transferred IP or Licensed IP in any jurisdiction throughout the world). The Seller acknowledges and agrees (including on behalf of the other Seller Parties) that the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates may record and perfect this IP Agreement or such documentation in any jurisdiction throughout the world, and the Seller shall (and shall cause the other Seller Parties to) cooperate therewith, at the Purchaser's expense. The Purchaser hereby requests, and the Seller hereby grants (and shall cause the other Seller Parties to grant) to the Purchaser and its Affiliates, all rights necessary to record this IP Agreement or such documentation with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, the United States Copyright Office, and any equivalent office or agency in any jurisdiction in the world. Seller shall (and shall cause the other Seller Parties) to, between the Effective Date and the Initial Closing Date, cooperate with the Purchaser in connection with the Purchaser's preparation for acquiring the Business, including (i) by reasonably sharing information to prevent any loss of any of the Seller Entities' rights to any Intellectual Property constituting Transferred IP or Licensed IP, and (ii) facilitating between the parties and their respective Affiliates' communication and sharing of information related to this IP Agreement.   36





Section 6.6 Governing Law; Forum.

(a) The Laws of the State of Delaware (without reference to its principles of conflicts of law) shall govern the construction, interpretation and other matters arising out of or in connection with this IP Agreement and its schedules (whether arising in contract, tort, equity or otherwise).

(b) Except with respect to (i) the result arising out of the escalation referenced in Section 2.1(b)(iii)(B) and (ii) the result of the escalation referenced in Section 2.1(b)(iii)(F) and any arbitration pursuant to Section 2.1(b)(iii)(F) (other than to enforce any arbitral judgment), the parties hereto irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware and the federal courts of the United States of America located in the State of Delaware over any Dispute arising out of or relating to this IP Agreements or any agreement or instrument contemplated thereby or entered into in connection herewith or therewith or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. Each party hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect of such Dispute or proceeding will be heard and determined in such courts (and the courts hearing appeals from such courts). The parties hereby irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any objection which they may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such Dispute brought in such court or any defense of inconvenient forum in connection therewith. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW THEN IN EFFECT, EACH PARTY HERETO WAIVES ITS RIGHT TO TRIAL OF ANY ISSUE BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS IP AGREEMENT OR THE ACTION OF ANY OF THE PARTIES THERETO IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT THEREOF.

Section 6.7 Severability. If any term or provision of this IP Agreement is determined to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the remaining terms and provisions of this IP Agreement remain in full force, if the essential terms and conditions of this IP Agreement for each party remain valid, binding and enforceable. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the parties hereto will negotiate in good faith to modify this IP Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

Section 6.8 Entire Agreement; Conflicting Provisions. This IP Agreement, together with the other Transaction Agreements and any side letters executed by the parties in connection therewith, and all of the exhibits and schedules appended hereto and thereto, constitute the final, complete and exclusive statement of the parties' agreement on the matters contained herein and therein. All prior and contemporaneous negotiations and agreements between the parties on the matters contained in this IP Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements are superseded by this IP Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements, including, but subject to Section 5.5(b) of the Acquisition Agreement, the NDA. In the event of any conflict between any specific provision of this IP Agreement (including Article V) and the provisions of the Acquisition Agreement with respect to the subject matter hereof, the provisions of this IP Agreement will control.





Section 6.9 Counterparts. The parties may execute this IP Agreement in multiple counterparts, each of which constitutes an original as against the party that signed it, and all of which together constitute one agreement. This IP Agreement is effective upon delivery of one executed counterpart from each party to the other party. The signatures of all parties need not appear on the same counterpart. The delivery of signed counterparts by facsimile or email transmission which includes a copy of the sending party's signature(s) is as effective as signing and delivering the counterpart in person.

Section 6.10 Amendment. The parties may amend this IP Agreement only by a written agreement signed by the parties and that identifies itself as an amendment to this IP Agreement.

Section 6.11 Waiver. The parties may waive a provision of this IP Agreement only by a writing signed by the party against whom enforcement of the waiver is sought. A party is not prevented from enforcing any right, remedy or condition in the party's favor because of any failure or delay in exercising any right or remedy or in requiring satisfaction of any condition, except to the extent that the party specifically waives the same in writing. A written waiver given for one matter or occasion is effective only in that instance and only for the purpose stated. A waiver once given is not to be construed as a waiver for any other matter or occasion. Any enumeration of a party's rights and remedies in this Agreement is not intended to be exclusive, and a party's rights and remedies are intended to be cumulative to the extent permitted by Law and include any rights and remedies authorized in Law or in equity.

Section 6.12 Notices. Each party giving any notice required or permitted under this IP Agreement will give the notice in writing, and shall be deemed to have been duly given: (i) when received if delivered personally; (ii) when transmitted if sent by facsimile (with transmission confirmed); (iii) the day after it is sent if sent by commercial overnight courier; (iv) upon receipt if sent by certified or registered mail (return receipt requested); or (v) when transmitted if sent by email (with receipt confirmed by recipient). Notice to a party is effective for purposes of this Agreement only if given as provided in this Section 6.12 at the address of which the sending party has been notified in accordance with this Section 6.12.
