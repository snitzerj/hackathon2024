All funds in the Designated Deposit Accounts shall at all times be held in trust for the benefit of Purchaser, subject to Agent's obligation to pay Expenses and fund the Wind-Down Payment. The Designated Deposit Accounts shall be cash collateral accounts, with all cash, credit card payments, checks and similar items of payment, deposits and any other amounts in such accounts being GOB Sale Proceeds or other amounts contemplated hereunder, and Merchant hereby grants to Purchaser, subject to Agent's obligation hereunder to fund the Wind-Down Payment and Expenses, a first priority senior security interest in each Designated Deposit Account and all funds on deposit in such accounts from and after the Closing.

(d) Merchant shall take all actions necessary to designate Agent as an authorized signer on all Designated Deposit Accounts and to grant Agent the ability to initiate wire transfers from such Designated Deposit Accounts, provided that Purchaser's interest in the Designated Deposit Accounts shall be subject to Agent's obligation to pay Expenses and fund the Wind-Down Payment.

(e) On each business day to the extent practicable, Merchant shall promptly pay to Agent by wire funds transfer all funds in the Designated Deposit Accounts (including, without limitation, GOB Sale Proceeds, GOB Sale Proceeds from credit card sales, and all other amounts) deposited into the Designated Deposit Accounts for the prior day(s), subject to Section 3.2(c) above.

19





Case 18-10248- MFW Doc 632-1 Filed 04/18/18 Page 21 of 60

shall not warrant the Merchandise in any manner, but will, to the extent legally permissible, pass on all manufacturers' warranties to customers. All sales will be made only for cash or nationally recognized bank credit cards. Upon entry of the Approval Order, Agent shall not accept or honor coupons during the Sale Term. The Agent shall clearly mark all receipts for the Merchandise sold at the Stores during the Sale Term so as to distinguish such Merchandise from the goods sold prior to the Sale Commencement Date. Unless otherwise agreed between Agent and the issuer of Merchant's private-label credit cards ("PLCCs"), Agent shall not accept PLCCs as a form of payment during the Sale.

8.3 Sales Taxes.

(a) During the Sale Term, all sales, excise, gross receipts and other taxes attributable to sales of Merchandise and Additional Agent Merchandise, as indicated on Merchant's point of sale equipment (other than taxes on income) payable to any taxing authority having jurisdiction (collectively, "Sales Taxes") shall be added to the sales price of Merchandise and Additional Agent Merchandise and collected by Agent, on Merchant's behalf, at the time of sale. All Sales Taxes shall be deposited into a segregated account designated by Merchant and Agent solely for the deposit of such Sales Taxes (the "Sales Taxes Account"). Merchant shall prepare and file all applicable reports and documents required by the applicable taxing authorities, and Merchant shall promptly pay all Sales Taxes from the Sales Taxes Account. Merchant will be given access to the computation of gross receipts for verification of all such tax collections. Provided that Agent performs its responsibilities in accordance with this Section 8.3, Agent shall have no further obligation to Merchant, any taxing authority, or any other party, and Merchant shall indemnify and hold harmless Agent from and against any and all costs, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees, assessments, fines or penalties which Agent sustains or incurs as a result or consequence of the failure by Merchant to promptly pay such taxes to the proper taxing authorities and/or the failure by Merchant to promptly file with such taxing authorities all reports and other documents required by applicable law to be filed with or delivered to such taxing authorities. If Agent fails to perform its responsibilities in accordance with this Section 8.3, and provided Merchant complies with its obligations hereunder, Agent shall indemnify and hold harmless Merchant from and against any and all costs, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees, assessments, fines or penalties which Merchant sustains or incurs as a result or consequence of the failure by Agent to collect Sales Taxes and/or the failure by Agent to promptly deliver any and all reports and other documents required to enable Merchant to file any requisite returns with such taxing authorities.

(b) Without limiting the generality of Section 8.3(a) hereof, it is hereby agreed that, as Agent is conducting the GOB Sale solely as agent for Merchant, various payments that this Agreement contemplates that one party may make to the other party (including the payment by Agent of the Guaranteed Amount) do not represent the sale of tangible personal property and, accordingly, are not subject to Sales Taxes.

8.4 Supplies. Agent shall have the right to use, without charge, all existing supplies located at the Stores, Distribution Centers and corporate office(s), including, without limitation, boxes, bags, paper, twine and similar sales materials (collectively, "Supplies").

Within thirty (30) days after the end of the Sale Term, or as soon as practicable thereafter, Agent and Merchant shall complete a final reconciliation of the Sale (the "Final Reconciliation"), the written results of which shall be certified by representatives of each of the Merchant and Purchaser as a final settlement of accounts between the Merchant and Purchaser with respect to the GOB Sale. Within five (5) days after the completion of the Final Reconciliation and execution of a settlement letter including an appropriate mutual release for the benefit of Merchant and Purchaser, Agent shall pay to Merchant, or Merchant shall pay to Agent, as the case may be, any and all amounts due the other pursuant to the Final Reconciliation. The Approval Order shall provide that the Final Reconciliation, once agreed to by Merchant and Purchaser, shall be automatically deemed approved pursuant to Bankruptcy Code section 105(a) and Rule 9019 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure without further order of the Bankruptcy Court or action by any party.

Agent is hereby, and shall be through the Approval Order, granted a first priority security interest in (i) the Additional Agent Merchandise and (ii) the Additional Agent Merchandise Proceeds, which security interest shall be deemed perfected pursuant to the Approval Order without the requirement of filing UCC financing statements or providing notifications to any prior secured parties (provided that Agent is hereby authorized to deliver any notices and file any financing statements and amendments thereof under the applicable UCC identifying Agent's interest in the Additional Agent Merchandise and any proceeds from the sale thereof as consigned goods thereunder and Merchant as the consignee therefor, and Agent's security interest in such Additional Agent Merchandise and Additional Agent Merchandise proceeds.

Subject to the Wind-Down Budget and payment of Expenses, Agent shall use the E-Commerce Platform in connection with the GOB Sale to fulfill customer orders made during the GOB Sale Term and otherwise promote the GOB Sale (in Agent's capacity as Agent hereunder), provided that Agent shall have the option, in its sole discretion, to terminate the use of the E-Commerce Platform at any time after four weeks of use. During the use of the E-Commerce Platform, and consistent with the Wind-Down Budget (i) Merchant shall continue to provide for the operation and maintenance of the E-Commerce Platform, including information technology and E-Commerce Platform updates, and provide Agent with all assistance with respect to the functionality of the E-Commerce Platform, fulfillment of orders, and promotion of the GOB Sale and (ii) Agent shall pay as an Expense those amounts reflected in Section 4.1(p) through and including the date that is seven (7) days after Agent provides Merchant with notice of Agent's intention to discontinue using the E-Commerce Platform as a sales platform to fulfill customer orders (the "LDOB Date"); provided, however, that, if Agent continues the Sale at the Stores after the LDOB Date, Merchant shall, as a Central Service and at no cost or expense to Agent (other than as provided in the Wind-Down Budget), maintain the E-Commerce Platform with limited functionality for the limited purposes

of advertising and promoting the Sale at the Stores, periodically updating such advertising and promotions, and maintaining and updating the Store locator function at no cost or expense to Agent. With respect to the E-Commerce Platform, (i) Agent shall be authorized to sell Additional Agent Goods through the E- Commerce Platform and (ii) the Parties may implement such other processes, procedures, and agreements as may be necessary or appropriate for the efficient and continued operation of the E-Commerce Platform.

Subject to the Wind-Down Budget and payment of Expenses, Agent may use Merchant's employees in the conduct of the Sale to the extent Agent deems necessary for the Sale, and Agent may select and schedule the number and type of Merchant's employees required for the Sale. Agent shall identify any such employees to be used in connection with the Sale (each such employee, a "Retained Employee"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Merchant's employees shall at all times remain employees of Merchant. Agent's selection and scheduling of Merchant's employees shall at all times comply with all applicable laws and regulations. Merchant and Agent agree that, except to the extent that wages and benefits of Retained Employees constitute Expenses hereunder, nothing contained in this Agreement and none of Agent's actions taken in respect of the Sale shall be deemed to constitute an assumption by Agent of any of Merchant's obligations relating to any of Merchant's employees including, without limitation, Excluded Payroll Benefits, Worker Adjustment Retraining Notification Act ("WARN Act") claims and other termination type claims and obligations, or any other amounts required to be paid by statute or law; nor shall Agent become liable under any employment agreement, collective bargaining agreement, or be deemed a joint or successor employer with respect to such employees. For the avoidance of doubt, Merchant shall be responsible for providing any required notice under the WARN Act with respect to its employees and otherwise comply with the WARN Act with respect to any "plant closing" or "mass layoff' (as defined in the WARN Act) or group termination or similar event affecting the employees, whether before or after the date of this Agreement.

or other extraordinary payments to, any Store or Distribution Center employees prior to the Sale Termination Date. Merchant shall not transfer any employee in anticipation of the Sale nor any Retained Employee during the Sale Term, in each case without Agent's prior consent. To the extent reasonably requested by Agent, and at Agent's expense, Merchant shall use commercially reasonable efforts to hire additional temporary employees to facilitate the GOB Sale, which employees shall constitute Retained Employees for purposes of this Agreement.

9.2 Termination of Employees. Agent may in its discretion stop using any Retained Employee at any time during the Sale, subject to the conditions provided for herein. In the event that Agent desires to cease using any Retained Employee, Agent shall notify Merchant at least seven (7) days prior thereto; provided, however, that, in the event that Agent determines to cease using an employee "for cause" (such as dishonesty, fraud or breach of employee duties), the seven (7) day notice period shall not apply; provided, further, however, that Agent shall immediately notify Merchant of the basis for such "cause." From and after the date of this Agreement and until the Sale Termination Date, Merchant shall not transfer or dismiss employees of the Stores or Distribution Centers except "for cause" without Agent's prior consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Agent shall not have the right to terminate the actual employment of any employee, but rather may only cease using such employee in the Sale and paying any Expenses with respect to such employee (and all decisions relating to the termination or non-termination of such employees shall at all times rest solely with Merchant).

9.3 Payroll Matters. During the Sale Term, Merchant shall process the payroll for all Retained Employees and any former employees and temporary labor engaged for the Sale. Each Wednesday (or such other date as may be reasonably requested by Merchant to permit the funding of the payroll accounts before such payroll is due and payable) during the Sale Term, Agent shall transfer to Merchant's payroll accounts an amount equal to the base payroll for Retained Employees plus related payroll taxes, workers' compensation and benefits for such week, to the extent such amount constitutes Expenses hereunder.

9.4 Employee Retention Bonuses. Subject to approval by the Bankruptcy Court, Agent may pay, as an Expense, retention bonuses and/or severance pay ("Retention Bonuses") (which bonuses shall be inclusive of payroll taxes, but as to which no benefits shall be payable), up to a maximum of $7,400,000 in the aggregate, to such Retained Employees who do not voluntarily leave employment, are not otherwise entitled to receive severance pay, and are not terminated "for cause," as Agent may determine in its discretion. Subject to approval by the Bankruptcy Court, the amount of such Retention Bonuses shall be in an amount to be determined by Agent, in its discretion, and shall be payable within thirty (30) days after the Sale Termination Date, and shall be processed through Merchant's payroll system.

(i) Subject to the Wind-Down Budget, Merchant shall, throughout the Sale Term, maintain in good working order, condition, and repair all cash registers, heating systems, air conditioning systems, elevators, escalators and all other mechanical devices necessary or appropriate for the conduct of the Sale at the Stores.

(j) Subject the Wind-Down Budget, payment of Expenses by Agent, and approval by the Bankruptcy Court, Merchant has paid, and will continue to pay throughout the Sale Term, all self-insured or Merchant-funded employee benefit programs for Store employees, including health and medical benefits and insurance and all proper claims made or to be made in accordance with such programs.

(b) To the extent permitted and authorized under the Indenture, (i) each member comprising Purchaser has the right, power and authority to execute and deliver each of the Agency Documents to which it is a party and to perform fully its obligations thereunder; (ii) each member comprising Purchaser has taken all necessary actions required to authorize the execution, delivery and performance of the Agency Documents, and no further consent or approval is required on the part of such member for such member to enter into and deliver the Agency Documents, to perform its obligations thereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby, and (iii) each of the Agency Documents has been duly executed and delivered by the members of Purchaser party thereto and, assuming the due authorization, execution, and delivery of this Agreement by Merchant, constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of such member enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, and similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally and by general principles of equity. No court order or decree of any federal, state or local governmental authority or regulatory body is in effect that would prevent or impair, or is required for, Purchaser's consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no consent of any third party which has not been obtained is required therefor, other than as provided herein. No contract or other agreement to which Purchaser is a party or by which Purchaser is otherwise bound will prevent or impair the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(c) No action, arbitration, suit, notice or legal administrative or other proceeding before any court or governmental body has been instituted by or against Purchaser, or has been settled or resolved or, to Purchaser's knowledge, has been threatened against or affects Purchaser, which questions the validity of this Agreement or any action taken or to be taken by Purchaser in connection with this Agreement or which, if adversely determined, would have a material adverse effect upon Purchaser's ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement.

Section 12. Insurance.

12.1 Merchant's Liability Insurance. Until the Designation Rights Termination Date or as otherwise directed by Purchaser or set forth in this Agreement, Merchant shall continue to maintain, subject to the Wind-Down Budget and the Wind-Down Cap, in such amounts as it currently has in effect, all of its liability insurance policies, including but not limited to commercial general liability, products liability, comprehensive public liability, auto liability and umbrella liability insurance, covering injuries to persons and property in, or in connection with, the Assets and/or Merchant's operation of its business and the Store and Distribution Centers; and Merchant shall cause Purchaser to be named as an additional named insured (as its interest may appear) with respect to all such policies. Merchant shall deliver to Purchaser certificates evidencing such insurance setting forth the duration thereof and naming Purchaser as an additional named insured, in form reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser. All such policies shall require at least thirty (30) days' prior notice to Purchaser of cancellation, non- renewal or material change. In the event of a claim under any such policies, Merchant shall be responsible for the payment of all deductibles, retentions or self- insured amounts thereunder (which may be reimbursed as an Expense and/or pursuant to the Wind-Down Payment, subject to the Wind-Down Budget and the Wind-Down Cap), unless it is determined that liability arose by reason of the willful misconduct or grossly negligent acts or omissions of Purchaser, or Purchaser's employees, independent contractors or agents. Merchant shall not make any change in the amount of any deductibles or self-insurance amounts on or after the date of this Agreement without Purchaser's prior written consent.

12.2 Merchant's Casualty Insurance. Until the Designation Rights Termination Date or as otherwise directed by Purchaser or set forth in this Agreement, Merchant shall continue to maintain, subject to the Wind-Down Budget and the Wind-Down Cap, all of its presently existing property casualty coverage related to the Assets (including but not limited to fire, flood, wind, hail, natural disaster, theft, and extended coverage casualty insurance) until the sale or other disposition of all Assets covered by such policies. From and after the date of this Agreement, all such policies will also name Purchaser as an additional named insured or loss payee, as applicable (as its interest may appear). In the event of a loss to the Assets on or after the date of this Agreement, all proceeds of such insurance shall constitute Proceeds hereunder. Merchant shall deliver to Purchaser certificates evidencing such insurance, setting forth the duration thereof and naming Purchaser as an additional insured or loss payee, as applicable, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser. All such policies shall require at least thirty (30) days' prior notice to Purchaser of cancellation, non-renewal or material change. Merchant shall not make any change in the amount of any deductibles or self-insurance amounts on or after the date of this Agreement without Purchaser's prior written consent. Upon the sale, conveyance, or other disposition of any Asset specifically identified in any of Merchant's casualty insurance policies, Merchant, if reasonably requested by Purchaser, shall cancel the casualty coverage specifically applicable to such Asset.

Section 13. Purchaser's Security Interest.

Subject to Agent's obligation to pay Expenses and fund the Wind-Down Payment:

(a) Upon the occurrence of the Closing, and solely to the extent that any Assets or Proceeds are, notwithstanding the Approval Order, subsequently determined to constitute property of Merchant's estate, Purchaser shall have a senior lien on all Assets and Proceeds, which lien shall be deemed by the Approval Order to be automatically perfected. The Approval Order shall grant Purchaser relief from the automatic stay, and nothing in the Approval Order shall inhibit Purchaser's ability, to take any action Purchaser deems appropriate to perfect such lien.

(b) Upon the occurrence of the Closing and until all Assets have been sold or otherwise disposed of, and solely to the extent that any Assets or Proceeds are, notwithstanding the Approval Order, subsequently determined to constitute property of Merchant's estate, Purchaser shall have a superpriority administrative expense claim against Merchant to the extent of any amounts owing from Merchant to Purchaser in connection with this Agreement, including as a result of any breach of this Agreement.

(c) Solely to the extent requested by Purchaser, Merchant shall exercise renewal and/or extension options under the Leases and Contracts.

(d) At any time prior to the earlier to occur of (i) the end of the Designation Rights Period applicable to a particular Lease or Contract and (ii) the Designation Rights Termination Date, Purchaser shall have the right, which right may be exercised at any time and from time to time, to file a Lease/Contract Assumption Notice in the Bankruptcy Cases designating the assignee (which may in certain circumstances be Purchaser, any of the entities comprising Purchaser, any of their respective affiliates, and/or a new entity created by any of the foregoing) of one or more Leases and/or Contracts (which may occur without further order of the Bankruptcy Court pursuant to the Approval Order) and setting forth the proposed cure amount due pursuant to section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code. The Approval Order shall provide that (a) the counterparties to the Leases or Contracts identified in any Lease/Contract Assumption Notice shall have twenty-one days to object to the proposed assumption and assignment, (b) if no objection to the proposed assumption and assignment of a Lease or Contract is timely received, such Lease or Contract shall, upon payment of the applicable cure payment, if any, to the applicable counterparty, automatically be deemed assumed by Merchant and assigned to the assignee identified in the Lease/Contract Assumption Notice pursuant to section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code, without further order of the Bankruptcy Court or further action by any person or entity, and (c) if an objection to the proposed assumption and assignment of a Lease or Contract is timely received, such Lease or Contract shall not be assumed or assigned until such objection is resolved by agreement of the applicable counterparty or order of the Bankruptcy Court.

(e) The designee under any Lease/Contract Assumption Notice shall be required, if requested by the applicable counterparty, to provide adequate assurance of future performance with respect to such Lease or Contract if the applicable counterparty so requests.

(f) Merchant shall have no responsibility for any cure amounts with respect to any Lease or Contract assumption and assignment.

Case 18-10248- MFW Doc 632-1 Filed 04/18/18 Page 33 of 60

assignees of (which may in certain circumstances be Purchaser, any of the entities comprising Purchaser, any of their respective affiliates, and/or a new entity created by any of the foregoing), any or all of the Assets free and clear of all liens, claims, and encumbrances thereon, without further order of the Bankruptcy Court (the "Asset Designation Rights"). Subject to Agent's payment obligations hereunder, Agent is authorized to execute, in the name of and as agent for Merchant, any and all deeds, bills of sale, and other instruments or documents necessary to effectuate the sale, transfer, or other conveyance of any of the Assets.

(b) Pursuant to the Approval Order, the sale or other conveyance of any Assets reflected in Asset Designation Notices filed in the Bankruptcy Cases from time to time by the Agent shall be automatically effective on the date reflected in the applicable Asset Designation Notice and subject to the satisfaction of any closing conditions reflected therein, and the sale, license, transfer, or other conveyance of such Assets shall be free and clear of all liens, claims, and encumbrances without further order of the Bankruptcy Court, provided, however, that nothing in the Approval Order shall inhibit the ability of Agent to seek other or further orders of the Court in connection with the sale or other disposition of any Assets.

(c) Except to the extent provided for by the Wind-Down Budget, the costs of maintaining the Assets available for marketing and sale shall constitute Expenses. All costs of effectuating assumption and assignment shall be deemed an Expense hereunder.

15.5 No Waiver. No consent or waiver by any Party, express or implied, to or of any breach or default by the other in the performance of its obligations hereunder shall be deemed or construed to be a consent or waiver to or of any other breach or default in the performance by such other Party of the same or any other obligation of such Party. Failure on the part of any Party to complain of any act or failure to act by the other Party or to declare the other Party in default, irrespective of how long such failure continues, shall not constitute a waiver by such Party of its rights hereunder.

15.6 Currency. All reference to dollars in this Agreement and all schedules, exhibits, and ancillary documents related to this Agreement shall refer to U.S. dollars.

15.7 Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Parties and their respective successors and assigns, including, but not limited to, any chapter 11 or chapter 7 trustee; provided, however, that this Agreement may not be assigned by any of the Parties without the prior written consent of the other, provided further that notwithstanding the foregoing, GA and Tiger may each collaterally assign this Agreement and their rights thereunder to their respective lenders.

At the request of any Party, each other Party shall re-execute original forms hereof and deliver them to all other Parties. No Party shall raise the use of a facsimile machine, electronic mail, or other electronic transmission in which the actual signature is evident to deliver a signature or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of a facsimile machine, electronic mail or other electronic transmission in which the actual signature is evident as a defense to the formation of a contract and each Party forever waives such defense. In proving this Agreement, it shall not be necessary to produce or account for more than one such counterpart signed by the Party against which enforcement is sought.

Case 18- 10248-MFW Doc 632-1 Filed 04/18/18 Page 36 of 60

Pursuant to the Bidding Procedures, Agent has provided a cash deposit in the amount of $32,700,000 (the "Deposit"), which is being held in escrow by co-counsel to Merchant, Young Conaway Stargatt & Taylor, LLP (the "Escrow Agent"). At the closing, the Deposit shall be released from escrow by the Escrow Agent and applied to the Cash Purchase Price. In the event the Closing fails to occur, then, only upon entry of a final and non-appealable order of the Bankruptcy Court determining that such failure was the result of Purchaser's sole, material, non-excusable breach of this Agreement, then Merchant shall be entitled to retain the Deposit as liquidated damages as Merchant's sole remedy for such breach.

15.12 Nature of Remedies. No failure to exercise and no delay in exercising, on the part of the Agent, any right, remedy, power, privilege or adjustment hereunder, shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power, privilege, or adjustment hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power, privilege, or adjustment.

15.13 Entire Agreement. This Agreement contains the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby and supersedes and cancels all prior agreements, including, but not limited to, all proposals, letters of intent or representations, written or oral, with respect thereto

B. The Sale shall be conducted in accordance with applicable state and local "Blue Laws", where applicable, so that no Sale shall be conducted on Sunday unless the Merchant had been operating such Store on a Sunday.

C. On "shopping center" property, Agent shall not distribute handbills, leaflets or other written materials to customers outside of any Stores' premises, unless permitted by the lease or, if distribution is customary in the "shopping center" in which such Store is located; provided that Agent may solicit customers in the Stores themselves. On "shopping center" property, Agent shall not use any flashing lights or amplified sound to advertise the Sale or solicit customers, except as permitted under the applicable lease or agreed to by the landlord.

D. At the conclusion of the Sale or the Designation Rights Period, as applicable, Agent shall vacate the Stores in broom clean condition; provided that Agent may abandon any FF&E not sold in the Sale at the Stores, the Distribution Centers, the Headquarters, or Merchant's other corporate offices at the conclusion of the Sale or the Designation Rights Period, as applicable, without cost or liability of any kind to Agent. Any abandoned FF&E left in a Store or Distribution Center, the Headquarters, or Merchant's other corporate offices after a lease is rejected shall be deemed abandoned to the landlord having a right to dispose of the same as the landlord chooses without any liability whatsoever on the part of the landlord to any party and without waiver of any damage claims against the Merchant. For the avoidance of doubt, as of the Sale Termination Date or termination of the Designation Rights Period, as applicable, Agent may abandon, in place and without further responsibility or liability of any kind, any FF&E located at a Store or, Distribution Center, the Headquarters, or Merchant's other corporate offices.

F. Agent shall be permitted to utilize display, hanging signs, and interior banners in connection with the Sale; provided, however, that such display, hanging signs, and interior banners shall be professionally produced and hung in a professional manner. The Merchant and Agent shall not use neon or day-glo on its display, hanging signs, or interior banners. Furthermore, with respect to enclosed mall locations, no exterior signs or signs in common areas of a mall shall be used unless otherwise expressly permitted in these Sale Guidelines. In addition, the Merchant and Agent shall be permitted to utilize exterior banners at (i) non- enclosed mall Stores and (ii) enclosed mall Stores to the extent the entrance to the applicable Store does not require entry into the enclosed mall common area; provided, however, that such banners shall be located or hung so as to make clear that the Sale is being conducted only at the affected Store, shall not be wider than the storefront of the Store, and shall not be larger than 4 feet x 40 feet. In addition, the Merchant and Agent shall be permitted to utilize sign walkers in a safe and professional manner and in accordance with the terms of the Approval Order.
