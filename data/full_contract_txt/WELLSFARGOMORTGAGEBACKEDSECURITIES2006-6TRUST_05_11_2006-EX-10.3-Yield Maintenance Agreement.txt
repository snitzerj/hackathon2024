2. Swap Disclosure Event. If upon the occurrence of a Swap Disclosure Event (as defined in paragraph (xxiii) above), UBS AG has not, within 5 business days after such Swap Disclosure Event complied with any of the provisions set forth in paragraph (xxiii) above, then an Additional Termination Event shall have occurred with respect to UBS AG with UBS AG as the sole Affected Party with respect to such Additional Termination Event.
