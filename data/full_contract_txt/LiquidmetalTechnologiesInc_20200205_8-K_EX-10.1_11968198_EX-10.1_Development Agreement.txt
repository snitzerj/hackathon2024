From time to time, Liquidmetal may encounter, develop, and refer to Eutectix customer accounts for direct sales by Eutectix. Provided that such referred customer is not already a Eutectix customer, Eutectix may accept such customer referral, and in that case hereby agrees to pay Liquidmetal a cash commission based on a percentage of the invoice price of Licensed Products sold by Eutectix or its permitted sublicensees and for which payment was actually received by Eutectix, in addition to the Liquidmetal Royalty. The cash commission shall be an amount equal to six percent (6.0%) of the Net Sales Price of the invoice price of Licensed Products sold by Eutectix or its permitted sublicensees and for which payment was actually received by Eutectix (the "Liquidmetal Commission"). The Liquidmetal Commission shall be paid in U.S. dollars within 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter, based on payments received for sales of Licensed Products made during a given quarter. Liquidmetal hereby waives the payment of any Liquidmetal Commission otherwise due and payable pursuant to this Agreement until the one (1) year anniversary of the Effective Date.

5.5 Right to Purchase. Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason, Eutectix shall have the option to purchase some or all of the Licensed Equipment at fair market value, less any amounts owed to Eutectix by Liquidmetal, except the equipment listed under Section 2.1(b) above.
