Detailed Signal Processing Algorithm Specification

A.1      HDLC Communications

Not included as Licensed Technology.

A.2      Voice Activity Detection

Voice Activity Detection (VAD) detects voice activity, adapts to background ambient or line noise as well as the presence of echo, classifies voice activity as "early" versus "sustained", and assigns an "effort level" to the speaker that is independent of network loss.





This module is used to detect voice activity in the CP Detect state.

A.2.1    Functional requirements:

The Voice Activity Detector discriminates voice activity generated by a caller from background noise (acoustic and line noise) as well as echo and sidetones reflected back to the receive voice path. It also provides an "effort level" quantity that indicates the level of effort of the caller. The functional and performance requirements are specified to cover a wide range of applications, such as voice activated recordings (as in voice messaging), outbound call classification, digital speech interpolation (DSI), and voice conferencing.

1.       The Voice Activity Detector classifies every block of voice data (8 ms          long) as "port active" (early detect), "speaker active" (port          sustained), and "not active".

2.       It provides a measurement that approximates the level of effort exerted          by the caller. Such an approximation is made by normalizing the short          term RMS of the voice signal by a longer term RMS value. The "effort          level" varies between -32 dB and 31 dB, and is at 0 dB when the speaker          is speaking at his/her "normal" level.

3.       The Voice Activity Detector adapts to background noise up to -24 dBm.          Adaptation is 200 ms when the noise level drops, and is approximately          1000 ms when noise rises.

4.       The Voice Activity Detector screens out sidetone or echo as speech up          to an ERL of -26 dB.

Software License                                           D2 Technologies, Inc. and Maintenance Agreement       August 4, 1997                      CONFIDENTIAL    21

A.2.2    Performance Requirements:

The accuracy of the voice Activity detector is measured by the rate of "false detection" (i.e. classifying noise or echo as voice activity) and "clipping" (i.e. classifying voice activity as noise or echo) under different ambient noise and echo conditions. "Port active" detection under different ambient noise conditions:

1.       No perceptible clipping at quiet to modest noise levels of -50 dBm to          -40 dBm with nominal levels of speech activity (-20 dBm average power          over 2 seconds of speech). No more than 5% of voice onsets is clipped          for noisy conditions (noise level from -40 dBm to -30 dBm).

2.       No more than 1% of "silence" periods is detected as speech for the          modest noise condition. No more than 2% of "silence" is detected as          port active for noisy conditions.

3.       The performance goals above is met when noise levels change during the          test.

"Speaker active" detection under different ambient noise conditions:

1.       Speech activity that lasts more than tSUSTAIN is detected as          "Sustained" or "Speaker Active".

2.       The clipping requirements is better than "Port Activity" detection.          Fewer than 0.5% of onsets/hour (2.5 per hour) for modest noise          condition (-45 dBm) and fewer than 2% (10 per hour) for high noise          condition (-35 dBm) have perceptible clipping.

3.       False detection performance (i.e., detecting noise as "speaker active")          exceeds those of "port activity" due to tSUSTAIN criteria. No more than          1% (36 seconds per hour) of noise segments is misclassified as          "sustained" for modest noise conditions, and no more than 2% (72          seconds per hour) of "silence" is detected as port active for noisy          conditions.

"Port active" and "Speaker active" detection in the presence of echo:

1.       Less than 1% of residual echo is detected as "port active" - (i.e. 36          sec. per hour) during normal operation of canceller.

2.       Less than 0.1 % (i.e. 3.6 sec per hour) of residual echo is detected as          "speaker active" or "port sustained" during normal operation of          canceller.

3.       Clipping of input speech in the presence of echo is no higher than          clipping in the presence of modest to high level of noise.

A.3      DTMF Detection

A.3.1    Functional requirements:

Table A-1 specifies the nominal frequencies for the DTMF digits that must be detected.

      --------------------------------------------------------------                                     Nominal High Group Frequencies (Hz)                                     1209      1336       1477      1633          --------------------------------------------------------------            Nominal        697        1         2          3         A





       Low Group       770        4         5          6         B          Frequencies      852        7         8          9         C             (Hz)          941        *         0          #         D          --------------------------------------------------------------

                    Table A-1: Nominal DTMF Frequencies

1.       Detect the presence of all 16 DTMF digits that are produced by          different phones on the market under a broad range of network          conditions.

2.       DTMF digit information is provided as soon as the minimum duration is          met. This information is called leading edge detection. This allows the          earliest possible response to the digit, such as stopping voice output.

3.       The trailing edge of a DTMF digit must be detected. This allows the          system to delay any response (such as playing out voice) to the digit          until the user has released the DTMF key. The criteria selected for          trailing edge detection will debounce DTMF digits.

4.       The DSP reports leading and trailing edge in the 8 ms block that they          are detected.  DTMF events are not buffered.

A.3.2    Performance requirements:

Table A-2 consists of performance requirements taken from EIA-464A and Bellcore TR-TSY-000181. Also shown is D2's DTMF performance requirements, which is a superset of the EIA and Bellcore requirements.

                 TABLE A-2: DTMF Performance Requirements

Other performance requirements:

1.       A leading edge of DTMF digit is signaled during the block in which the          minimum duration is met, and the trailing edge is signaled during the          block in which the minimum debounce interval is met.

2.       Talk-down: DTMF detection must work reliably in the presence of echo          (for the maximum allowable output voice level) and with varying levels          of DTMF signals (due to network loss). D2's DTMF detector combined with          the echo must meet the performance requirements of Figure A-I in the          presence echo generated by playing pause-removed voice (male and          female) at - 18 dBm ASL (averaged over 3 seconds) over a telephone          circuit with 15 dB echo return loss (ERL).

                Figure A-1: DTMF Talk-down Acceptance Curve

3.       Debounce test: Long tones (generated by "hard" key presses) must not be          detected as multiple tones in the presence of echo interference or line          noise. Combined with the echo canceller, the DTMF detector is required          to reliably "debounce" all DTMF digits above -18 dBm in the presence of          voice levels below -15 dBm (ASL) and a telephone circuit with echo          return loss (ERL) of 15 dB.

4.       Double-talk talk-off: Many voice processing hardware or semiconductor          manufacturers significantly degrade the "talk-off' performance of their          detector in the presence of voice echo or sidetone to achieve a high          level of talk-down performance. This strategy is acceptable in a pure          digit-in-voice-out scenario, but for voice conferencing or voice          recognition applications, voice could be present in the both the          transmit and receive path. In such cases, the DTMF detector must be          very robust against "talk-off" in double-talk situations. The talk-off          requirements for D2's DTMF detector under double-talk is fewer than 66          talkoffs for the Bellcore talk-off tape.

A.4      Tone Generation

The tone generation module can be programmed to generate any single, dual or amplitude modulated tone required to meet international telecommunications specifications. This functionality is provided by the GENF module, which produces the sum or product of two independently generated sine waves as its output. Each sine wave can be individually parameterized.

A.4.l    Functional requirements:

The GENF module is designed to generate a wide range of DTMF, Call Progress Signals, MF Rl/R2, and miscellaneous tones. In order to meet or exceed international telecommunication specifications, GENF must meet or exceed the following functional requirements.

1.       Independent arguments shall be supplied for each frequency for dual          tones that GENF generates. Single tones are generated by specifying          that one of the dual tone's frequencies is 0 Hz.

2.       Independent arguments shall be supplied for the carrier and modulation          frequencies for amplitude modulated tones that GENF generates.

3.       Arguments shall be supplied that allow the frequency of a tone to be          set in the range of 0 to 4000 Hz in 1 Hz units.

4.       Arguments shall be supplied that allow the output power to be set in          the range of +3 to -50 dBm in 0.5 dB steps.

5.       Arguments shall be supplied that allow an amplitude modulated tone's          modulation percentage to be set in the range of 0 to 300% in 1% units.

6.       The tone duration (make time) shall be specified in 1 ms units. Tone          durations shall be specified in the range of 0 to 8191 ms.

7.       An unlimited tone duration shall be specified by setting the make          duration to -1.

8.       The silence duration between tones (break time) shall be specified in 1          ms units. Silence durations shall be specified in the range of 0 to          8191 ms.

9.       An unlimited silence duration shall be specified by setting the make          duration to -1 and setting both frequencies of a dual tone to 0 Hz.

10.      The GENF module shall allow tones to be generated that meet or exceed          EIA/TIA-464 requirement for DTMF and call progress tone generation.

11.      The GENF module shall allow tones to be generated that meet or exceed          CCITT Blue Book Volume VI Fascicle VI.4 recommendations Q.310-Q.490          requirements for MF R1 and R2 tone generation.

12.      The GENF module shall generate tones with one to three unique cadence          pairs (on/off pairs).

A.4.2    Performance Requirements

1.       Frequency accuracy shall exceed 1 Hz. 2.       Level accuracy shall exceed 0.5 dB. 3.       Timing information shall exceed 1 ms accuracy.

A.5      Universal Tone Detector

A.5.l    Overview

The Universal Tone Detector (UTD) is a high configurable tone detector. By changing parameters, this algorithm can classify a wide range of single and dual tone call progress signals generated in a wide variety of countries.

A.5.2    General

Since different tones need different detection heuristics, and tones may have multiple specifications, each tone is tagged with a tone category identifier.

                        Table A-3: Tone Categories

In addition to specifying a tone category, the parameters include a value that is returned to the application when the tone is detected. This parameter need not be unique. This allows multiple specifications to report the same tone event to the application. UTD is table driven. Using this approach, the tone detector searches parameter tables for a matching tone. When a tone matches, the tone code determines the heuristics necessary to completely classify the tone. Also, the tones must be specified in a way that a set of parameters corresponds to either a single tone, a dual tone, or an amplitude modulated tone.

A.5.3    General Functional Requirements

UTD functionally combines a single tone detector and a dual/modulated tone detector into a single module. UTD combines the results of these detectors into a single result. UTD has the following requirements.

1.       The DSP shall indicate that the first ringback has started after at          least 400 ms of ringback like signal has been processed, as long as no          other tone type is early detected. If more than one type of tone is          early detected, the first ringback reporting shall be delayed until          either cadence information disqualifies the other types, or tone          precedence is used as a 'tie-breaker'.

28

2.       The DSP shall indicate ringback has stopped when ringback is no longer          detected.

3.       The DSP shall indicate a busy tone has been detected after the          requisite number of make and break intervals have been processed, and          no other tone category is still a candidate for detection.

4.       The DSP shall indicate a reorder tone has been detected after the          requisite number of make and break intervals have been processed, and          no other tone category is still a candidate for detection.

5.       The DSP shall indicate a number unobtainable tone has been detected          after the requisite number of make and break intervals have been          processed, and no other tone category is still a candidate for          detection.

6.       In the event that more than one tone is a candidate for detection,          detection is delayed until all characteristics that may disqualify any          of the candidates are tested (for example, waiting for multiple cadence          pairs to occur). If there is still more than one potential tone after          all differentiating features have been exhausted, then the tone with          the highest precedence is detected. Also, if the tone ceases prior to          singling out one candidate tone, then the tone with the highest          precedence is detected. Precedence is shown in Table A-3.

7.       The DSP shall supply an early detect flag. This flag shall be valid          after the detector has processed no more than 72 ms of a tone. If more          than one tone category is early detected, then the early detect flag          shall indicate the tone category with the highest precedence.

A.5.3.1 TONE DETECTOR PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS

A.5.3.1.1 Single Tones

There are four types of parameters that shall be used to control single tone detection. The variation of each parameter shall be limited by the constraints listed in Table A-5.

                                      ------------------------------                                          Minimum             Maximum          --------------------------------------------------------------          Frequency                       300 Hz              3300 Hz          --------------------------------------------------------------          Bandwidth                       0 Hz                1800 Hz          --------------------------------------------------------------          Duration                        100 msec            32760 msec          --------------------------------------------------------------          Minimum Power Level             -45 dBm             3 dBm          --------------------------------------------------------------

               Table A-5: Single Tone Detection Constraints

The frequency detection range shall be specified the Frequency and Bandwidth parameters. Figure A-2 shows the relationship of these parameters. Note that the bandwidth specification is symmetric about the center frequency. The Frequency and Bandwidth parameters define a "must detect" range. The detector shall not use frequency criteria to reject any tones which are within the range specified Frequency/Bandwidth parameters. Tones whose frequencies are outside but close to frequency range may be detected.

Figure A-2: Frequency Domain Representation of tone parameters for a             Single Tone

If the Power Level of the detected parameter is greater than the minimum power specified by the parameters, the signal shall not be rejected by Power Level heuristics. Duration parameters are used to set the allowable duration of a tone. Minimum and maximum tone durations may be specified (make durations). Also, minimum and maximum silence durations between tones may be specified.

A.5.3.1.2         Dual Tones

Dual tones are created by summing two sinusoids. Since each tone can be isolated in the frequency domain, dual tones are specified as a pair of single tones. Parameters for each tone of a dual pair use the same constraints as single tones. Namely, frequency1 is the center frequency of the lower tone, and bandwidth1 specifies its frequency tolerance. The same is true for frequency2 and bandwidth2 for the high tone. Figure A-3 shows the definition of the frequency and bandwidth parameters for a dual tone.

Not all dual tones are detectable by UTD. A dual tone shall detected only when the difference between the two component frequencies is greater than 10 Hz and less than 230Hz.

A.5.3.1.3         Amplitude Modulated Tones

Amplitude modulated tones are created by multiplying two sinusoids. When analyzed in the frequency domain, a modulated tone looks like three tones. Figure A-4 shows the frequency spectrum for a modulated tone.

The tone whose frequency is the average of the other tones is the carrier. The other two tones can be referred to as side lobes. For amplitude modulated tones, frequencyl and bandwidth1 specify the low sidelobe and its tolerance, while frequency2 and bandwidth2 specify the high sidelobe and its tolerance.

      Figure A-4: Frequency Domain Representation of Tone Parameters                          for an Amplitude Modulated Tone

As with dual tones, not all modulated tones will be detected by UTD. Modulated tones shall be detected if the difference between the carrier frequency and the sidelobes is between 10 Hz and 230 Hz.

A.5.3.l.4         Precedence

By assigning a detection precedence to the classification process, tone frequency ranges can overlap. When a tone's parameters fall into a range shared by two or more signals, the signal is classified as the one with the highest precedence.

                   Table A-6: Tone Detection Precedence

Table A-6 shows the precedence of typical tones that the UTD module detects. Modem signals have the highest precedence, and Unknown tones have the lowest. Therefore, the frequency range of unknown tones can safely overlap the other tone ranges without causing tones to be misclassified. If the range for Unknown tones is allowed to be the maximum range allowed by the detector, any detected tone that is unclassified would be designated as Unknown.

                   Table A-8: Call Progress Tone Cadence

Performance Requirements:

1.       Frequency Deviation: Even though the generator is required to meet a          frequency tolerance per tone of +/-0.5%, the detector needs to allow          for a wider frequency tolerance due to variations in generators and          line distortions. The CP detector detects all tones whose component          frequencies deviate less than 1% from nominal.

2.       Twist: The CP detector detects all tones whose twist is less than +/-4          dB.

3.       Dynamic Range:  The CP detector exhibits a minimum dynamic range of           25 dB.

4.       Cadence: The CP detector must detect call progress tones whose cadence          is within +/-10%.

5.       Talkoff: The CP detector makes no false detections in 12 hours of          testing with voice at -15 to -18 dBm ASL.

A.5.3.1.6         FAX CNG Tone Detection

The standard connection protocol for automatic connection of a FAX modem requires that the calling FAX modem generate a calling tone (CNG). Hence for incoming calls, the EVP software has to detect a CNG signal. When CNG is detected, EVP alerts the Core Processor to redirect the call to a FAX machine or a FAX modem embedded within the call processing system.

      c)       The power of a CNG tone is between 0 and -43 dBm.

2.       The detector does not miss any CNG signals from the same FAX machines          connected to a local CO with a noise level of less than -45 dBm.

3.       The detector misses less than 0.5% of CNG signals (generated at -10          dBm) when compressed voice is output at a level of-15 dBm or less          (average over 3 seconds) into a network whose ERL is greater than 15          dB.

4.       The detector does not falsely detect more than 1 CNG tone per 5 hours          of voice (based on Bellcore recorded talk radio voice tapes.)

A.5.3.1.7         Modem Tone Specification

All answering modems that conform to the ITU V.25 answering sequence present a 2100 Hz tone 1.8 to 2.5 seconds after answering the telephone line. Figure A-6 and Figure A-7 show the timing of the answering tone (ANS). In Figure A-6, the 2100 Hz

tone reverses phase every [tau] intervals. These phase reversals disconnect echo cancellers and echo suppressors from the network. According to ITU G.164, phase reversal shall be accomplished such that the phase is within 180 +/-10 degrees in 1 ms and that the amplitude of the 2100 Hz tone is not more than 3 dB below its steady state value for more than 400 musec.

4.       The detector does not falsely detect the presence of a modem answer          tone more than once per 5 hours of voice (using Bellcore recorded talk          radio voice tapes).

5.       There is no talkdown performance requirement. The near end is always          silent and does not interfere with far end modem ANS signals.

A.5.3.1.8         Three Tone Sequences

Most countries that generate Special Information Tones (SIT) use a three tone sequence. SIT sequences are generated by various central offices or common carrier switching points to indicate a problem with the dialed call. A SIT tone sequence generally precedes a recorded voice announcement such as "the number you have dialed is no longer in service..." and is provided specifically for the purpose of detection of the problem type by an automated device.

There are two popular types of SIT sequences. The first type is used mainly in Europe. It consists of a sequence of three tones of identical durations. The second type is the one used in North America. There are several North American SIT sequences that are encoded using various combinations of frequency and duration for each of the three tones. The encoding has been standardized by Bellcore.

Performance Requirements:

1.       The UTD shall handle both types of sequences.

2.       There is no talkdown performance requirement. The near end is always          silent and does not interfere with far end SIT signals.

A.5.3.1.9         Unknown Tone

Any single tone, dual tone, amplitude modulated tone or single tone sequence that is not classified as a CP, SIT, CNG or modem ANS tone, shall be reported as an unknown tone.

Performance Requirements:

2.       There shall be fewer than 1 talkoff in 5 hours of voice when the          detector is programmed with the recommended parameters (minimum tone          duration 400 ms). Assuming that each voice call is has an average of 2          seconds of voice, there shall be fewer than 1 talkoff in 9000 calls.

1.       Be configurable to detect either R1, R2 forward, or R2 backward MF          digits on a per-call basis.

2.       Detect the presence of all 15 R1, 15 R2 Forward, and 15 R2 Backward          digits under a broad range of network conditions.

3.       MF digit information is provided as soon as the minimum duration is          met. This information is called leading edge detection. This allows the          earliest possible response to the digit, such as in compelled          signaling.

4.       The trailing edge of a MF digit must be detected. This allows the          system to delay any response (such as in compelled signaling) to the          digit until it is removed. The criteria selected for trailing edge          detection will debounce MF digits.

5.       The DSP reports leading and trailing edge in the 8 ms block that they          are detected. MF events are not buffered.

           Table A-14: MFD R2 Detection Performance Requirements

A.7      MFcR2 compelled signaling

In order to pass the CCITT requirements for compelled signal timing, the following additional requirements are made on the MFD detector:

DEVELOPMENT, MAINTENANCE, AND RUNTIME LICENSE FEE SCHEDULE

DEVELOPMENT LICENSE FEES: LICENSED TECHNOLOGY FOR THE BASIC SERVICES SPECIFIED IN EXHIBIT A

Development license fees are specified in PO #104962.

50% of which has already been paid to D2 and the final 50% to be paid upon the delivery and acceptance of the Licensed Technology for Basic Services by Licensee in accordance with Article 4 of this Agreement.

MAINTENANCE FEES: LICENSED TECHNOLOGY FOR THE BASIC SERVICES SPECIFIED IN EXHIBIT A

The Maintenance Fee after the expiry of the Warranty period shall be $20,000 per year, starting from the date after the Warranty period (Contract Year),





renewable at the end of each Contract Year.

In the event that during the four consecutive calendar quarters which begin immediately after the start of a Contract Year, LICENSEE completes payments to D2 of one hundred thousand dollars in Runtime License Fees under this Agreement, D2 will apply a credit equaling to 100% of the Maintenance Fee against the Runtime License Fees of that Contract Year.

In the event that LICENSEE exercises the Buy Out option for Runtime License Fees, there shall be no Maintenance Fee for the first three years after the expiry of the Warranty period.

RUNTIME LICENSE FEES: LICENSED TECHNOLOGY FOR BASIC SERVICES SPECIFIED IN EXHIBIT A AND SIMPLE CONFERENCING TECHNOLOGY

A runtime license fee shall be paid for each SRM in the Licensee Product (Exhibit B) which contains the Licensed Technology for Basic Services and simple conferencing which does not require network echo cancellation technology (Exhibit A) sold by LICENSEE. Licensee Products which do not run the Licensed Technology are not subject to runtime license fees.

The runtime license fee is based on the number of ports of service that a customer can expect the SRM to provide. As such, this runtime license fee calculation may be used for an SRM with any number of DSP processors (DSPs), with any MIPS

performance rating, as long as it is from the TI TMS320C54x, TMS320C55x, or TMS320C6x processor family.

Fee_per_SRM = Fee_per_Port * DSPs_per_SRM * Average_Ports_per_DSP

Where:

      Fee_per_SRM is the runtime license fee for each SRM.           Fee_per_Port is on Table 1.           DSPs_per_SRM is the number of DSPs on each SRM.          Average_Ports_per_DSP is defined below.

      -----------------------------------------------------------          total quantity of processors licensed          Fee_per_port          -----------------------------------------------------------                      1-5,000                               $2.00          -----------------------------------------------------------                   5,001 - 25,000                           $1.00          -----------------------------------------------------------                  25,001 - 50,000                           $0.75          -----------------------------------------------------------                   5,001 - 75,000                           $0.50          -----------------------------------------------------------                    > 75,000                                $0.00          -----------------------------------------------------------

                           Table 1. Fee per port

If LICENSEE commits to purchase licenses for a minimum of 10,000 processors for the first year after first customer shipments, the fee_per_port will be reduced for $1.00 for the first 5,000 processors.

The SRM will provide 5 Basic Services and simple conferencing (which does not require network echo cancellation):

      1.     DTG -- Digital Tone Generation (static channels and outpulsing)          2.     CPA -- Call Progress Analysis (with Voice Activity Detection)          3.-    DRC -- DTMF Detection          4.     MFR(1) -- Multifrequency Reception (1)          5.     MFCR2 -- Multifrequency Reception and Transmission, Compelled R2

To determine the Average ports per DSP, the completed software will be tested in a heavily-loaded VCO/20 to determine the maximum number of ports that a single DSP processor performing each of the Basic Services can reliably satisfy.  This

maximum will be documented in Table 2 below, and will be encoded in software, to prevent a customer from exceeding it.

This maximum will vary depending on the DSP processor speed, so a separate measurement will have to be done for SRMs containing faster processors. Due to system limitations, this number will never exceed 63.

The number of ports supported for each of the Basic Services, per DSP processor, will be averaged (arithmetic mean) to create an average number of ports per DSP (Average_Ports_per_DSP). Because of the computational simplicity of the DTG Service, it will not be included in this calculation:

         Average_Ports_per_DSP = (#CPA + #DRC + #MFR1 + #MFCR2)/4

               TABLE 2.  MEASURED PERFORMANCE OF SERVICES

CAP: The runtime license fees is fully paid up after it reaches the CAP, which is the cumulative runtime license fees paid by LICENSEE for the first 75,000 processors as specified in Table 1 above. The CAP is cumulative across the Texas Instruments TMS320C54x, TMS320CSSx, and TMS320C6x, and other TI processors based on the same core processor architecture.

BUYOUT OPTION: Within the Warranty period, LICENSEE may elect to pay D2 a sum of $1,400,000 as a one time paid-up runtime license fees for the Basic Services specified in Exhibit A.
