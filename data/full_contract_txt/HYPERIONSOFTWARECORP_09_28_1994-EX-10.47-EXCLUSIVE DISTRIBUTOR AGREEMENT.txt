     2.1    Price.                -----

     Distributor shall adhere to the then current Developer Prices for each Product (collectively, the "Prices"). Developer's current Prices for each Product are set forth in Schedule C.

     Upon Developer's receipt of a written order from Distributor (each an "Order") together with a copy of an executed End-User License Agreement and Contract Summary Form (Appendix D), Developer will ship to Distributor the designated quantities of the Products. At Distributor's expense, the Products shall be shipped by Developer to Distributor F.O.B. origin, freight pre-paid, with risk of loss to pass to Distributor upon delivery of the Products by Developer to a common carrier. Notwithstanding the above, upon notice to Distributor, Developer may ship the Software directly to Distributor's customer. The terms and conditions of this Agreement shall apply to all Orders submitted to Developer by Distributor. Orders issued by

                                   4    5

Distributor to Developer are solely for the purpose of requesting delivery dates and quantities. All Orders shall be subject to acceptance by Developer; Developer will not unreasonably delay acceptance of any order. Developer shall use reasonable efforts to deliver accepted Orders but shall not be liable for any damages to Distributor or to any third party caused by Developer's delay or error in filling, or failure to fill, any Orders for any reason. Except as otherwise provided herein, all fees and expenses payable hereunder for which Developer issues an invoice to Distributor shall be due and payable thirty (30) days from the date of the invoice. A late payment charge of the lesser of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month or the highest interest rate allowed by applicable law shall be charged upon all unpaid amounts due hereunder for more than thirty (30) days.

     2.3 Reporting; Royalties.             --------------------

     Distributor shall submit Monthly Sales and Royalty Reports and make payments to Developer as provided herein. All royalties paid to Developer shall be based upon Developer's list prices in U.S. Dollars, except as otherwise agreed in writing by Developer.

     Software license fees associated with Software license agreements in which the sales cycle begins on or after May 1, 1994 (hereinafter "New Software license agreements") for Product sites located in the Territory, shall be allocated and distributed as follows:

              Gross Software Revenue Generated     % to Distributor                  --------------------------------     ----------------                  Per Annum July 1- June 30

              US$O -- $999,999                          40%                  US$1,O00,000 +                            50%

     On July 1 each year, the gross software revenue generated figure will be reset to zero and the accumulation of software revenues will restart.

     However, the foregoing allocation of such fees associated with the New Software license agreements involving a headquarter Product or other site licenses situated outside of the Territory may be subject to reduced percentages to Distributor due to royalties owed to other Developer entities, affiliates, or distributors located outside the Territory, who may also have participated in the sale. Each such situation will be evaluated individually and a final decision on the royalty due will be based upon each party's relative contribution and will be made in Developer's sole discretion. The general guidelines for such cases are outlined in Appendix E (Bergamo Rules).

     Installation, consulting, and training fees associated with the Products are due and payable to the party performing the services.

                                    5    6

     License Renewal and Maintenance Fees will be split evenIy with 50% distributed to Developer and 50% distributed to Distributor, also subject to paragraph 4 of this section 2.3.

     Distributor will submit a monthly report to Developer which accurately identifies the Software license fees, maintenance fees, and any other fees set forth in this Agreement (repons outlined in Schedule D). This report is due at





the earliest possible time, but in no event later than ten (10) days following the end of each calendar month Payment by Distributor of the applicable royalty fees to Developer shall accompany the report; provided, however, that Developer shall have the reasonable fight to inspect Distributor's books from time to time during the term hereof and for a one (1) year period after the termination of this Agreement for purposes of verifying the royalties payable to Developer. In addition, Distributor shall report the acquisition of each new license  for the Software system to Developer and will provide either an English translation of the End-User License Agreement or a completed contract extract schedule in the form of Exhibit D (Contract Summary Form) within one (1) day of accepting the order.

     24  Inspection and Acceptance.             -------------------------

     Distributor shall inspect all Products immediately upon delivery and shall, within seven (7) calendar days, give written notice to the common cartier and Developer of any claim for damages or shortages. Distributor shall give written notice to Developer within thirty (30) calendar days of delivery in the event that any Product does not conform with the terms of this Agreement. If Distributor fails to give any such notice, the Products shall be deemed accepted for all purposes of this Agreement.

     2.5    Taxes.                -----

     In addition to the Prices and other fees payable hereunder, Distributor shall record and pay any federal, state, local or other duties, withholding and excise taxes, now or hereafter applied on the sale, transportation, import, export, licensing or use of the Products including sales tax, value added tax or similar tax. Any taxes imposed by federal, state or any local government or any amount in lieu thereof, including interest and penalties thereon, paid or payable at any time by Developer in connection with Developer's license to Distributor, exclusive of taxes based on Developer's net income, shall be borne by Distributor.

     Distributor shall co-operate with and assist Developer, as reasonably necessary, to obtain United States tax credits for any duties or taxes described in this Section 2.5 which may be credited to and/or recovered by Developer and applied by Developer to reduce its United States tax liability. In the event Developer obtains any such tax credits, Developer shall notify Distributor of the amount thereof and Distributor shall be entitled to apply such amount against future amounts payable by Distributor to Developer hereunder.
