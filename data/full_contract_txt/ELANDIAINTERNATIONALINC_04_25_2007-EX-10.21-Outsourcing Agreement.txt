2. Managed Third Parties (MTP)

Datec will apply the appropriate severity level and take action as required with managed third party vendors when the resolution requires the involvement of a managed third party.

In the first instance Datec will liase with the managed third party vendor directly keeping records of the action for reporting purposes.

Should there be no successful resolution to this approach within the time durations within this SLA, Datec will escalate the matter directly to the BSP Customer Business Manager (CBM). In any event the CBM will be aware of the request to the MTP due to the daily reporting systems in place.

Once escalated to the BSP CBM, the BSP undertakes to take control of the liaison with the MTP to help Datec resolve the issue.   Commercial in Confidence   Page 49   May 2004
