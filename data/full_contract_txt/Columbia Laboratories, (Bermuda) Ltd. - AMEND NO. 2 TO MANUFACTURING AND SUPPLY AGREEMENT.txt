Columbia and Fleet acknowledge and agree that in the event the terms of this Agreement and the Technical Agreement conflict or are inconsistent, the terms of this Agreement shall prevail over the terms of the Technical Agreement; provided however, that to the extent possible, the terms of both the Technical Agreement and this Agreement shall be read and considered to effect the intent of the parties."

24. The following new Section 13.13 shall be added to Section 13 of the Existing Agreement (General Provisions):
