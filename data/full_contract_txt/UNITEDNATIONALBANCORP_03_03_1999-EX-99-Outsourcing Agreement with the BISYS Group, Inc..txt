United National Bancorp Enters Into                 Outsourcing Agreement with the BISYS Group, Inc.

Bridgewater,  NJ -- February 18, 1999 -- United National Bancorp (Nasdaq:  UNBJ) announced today that its principal subsidiary, United National Bank, has entered into a  multi-year  agreement  with the BISYS  Group,  Inc.  whereby  BISYS will provide integrated  information  processing services, as well as item processing and deposit services, for United National.

"We are excited about the  opportunities  available to us as a result of our new partnership  with BISYS," stated Thomas C. Gregor,  chairman and chief executive officer of United National.  "During the past year we completed an assessment of our  information  processing  needs going forward into the next  century.  After evaluating a number of different options, we determined that the flexibility and quality of BISYS'  TOTALPLUS (R) system would best serve our needs today and for years to come."

United Financial  Services, a third party services provider that United National Bancorp owns with another joint venture  partner,  currently handles the Bank's information  processing  services,  item processing and deposit  services.  As a result of its planned move to BISYS,  United  National will be  liquidating  its interest  in United  Financial  Services  during the first half of 1999 after it goes live with BISYS.

"Our  investment  in United  Financial  Services  has made a great deal of sense since we established it in 1995," said Mr. Gregor.  "United Financial  Services has allowed  United  National to realize  significant  efficiencies  through the sharing of technology and processing  costs.  Nevertheless,  we believe that the enhanced  capabilities  which  BISYS  offers  are  better  matched to the future direction of our Bank."
