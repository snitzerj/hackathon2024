This Distribution Agreement (the "Agreement") is entered into by and between American Express Incentive Services, L.L.C., a Missouri limited liability company ("AEIS"), and its Reseller, Schoolpop, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Schoolpop").

The following points outline this agreement:

1.       PURPOSE

Under and subject to the terms of this Agreement:

AEIS will provide Schoolpop for resale the following stored                   value cards: Encompass(R) Select, Persona(R) Select, Fill It                   Up(R), and Be My Guest(R), and any other stored value products                   developed by AEIS and mutually agreed upon by both parties,                   ("Cards"). The Cards shall be sold only to those of                   Schoolpop's clients and prospective clients (the "Clients"),                   in the United States who are nonprofit organizations, ("NPO                   Marketplace"), which are defined as organizations that are (i)                   a school, (ii) an organization formed as not-for-profit under                   its charter documents, or (iii) an organization related to (i)                   or (ii) such as a participating school's Parent Teacher                   Organization or other similarly related organization.

b.       Period One shall mean the Effective Date through the date that                   Schoolpop has met all of the Security Requirements as such                   term is defined herein and has received approval from AEIS to                   assume all Card inventory, distribution and fulfillment                   responsibilities as currently managed by AEIS. Period Two                   shall commence with the end of Period One through the                   Termination Date.

2.       EXCLUSIVITY

a.       Schoolpop shall have the exclusive right to resell Cards in                   the NPO Marketplace. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Schoolpop                   shall fund from AEIS a minimum of $52,000,000 of Cards (the                   "Guaranteed Minimum") in each Contract Year in order to                   maintain the exclusive right to sell Cards in the NPO                   Marketplace. A Contract Year shall be the period of August 1                   through July 31 of the succeeding year. In any Contract Year                   in which Schoolpop fails to fund the Guaranteed Minimum, AEIS                   shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to (a) terminate                   the Agreement or (b) revoke the exclusivity.

b.       In consideration of the exclusivity referred to above,                   Schoolpop shall pay AEIS a marketing rights fee ("Marketing                   Rights Fee"), of $1,250,000. The Marketing Rights Fee shall be                   paid in five (5) equal installments of $250,000 on March 15th                   of each year with the first such payment being due on March                   15, 2005 and with the final payment due on March 15, 2009.

c.       Schoolpop shall also pay AEIS a fee of $250,000, (the                   "Encompass(R) Select Fee") as consideration for the right to                   sell the Encompass(R) Select Card through December 31, 2004.                   The Encompass(R) Select Fee shall be payable concurrently with                   the execution of this Agreement.

d.       Schoolpop understands and agrees that this Agreement does not                   grant Schoolpop any exclusive right to market the Cards or any                   other AEIS products and services outside of the NPO                   Marketplace. AEIS, on its own behalf, reserves the right to                   market its Cards and other products and services directly as

1

well as through additional firms on terms and conditions that                   it selects in its sole discretion, provided that no such sales                   shall take place within the NPO Marketplace.





3.       INVENTORY AND FORECASTING

a.       Schoolpop shall secure a physical location for maintaining,                   distributing, and fulfilling Card inventory no later than                   August 1, 2004 which location shall be subject to such                   security requirements (the "Security Requirements") as shall                   be required by AEIS or American Express Travel Related                   Services, Inc. all as further set forth in the Trust Agreement                   attached hereto as Exhibit 1.

b.       Schoolpop shall effectively manage its Card inventory and                   Ordering schedule such that all Cards are resold and                   distributed to the Client with the following Card expiration                   lives (the "Card Life") intact:

i.       Persona(R) Select - nine (9) months                   ii.      Encompass(R) Select, Be My Guest(R), Fill It Up(R) -                            three (3) months          The Card life of any Cards other than Cards specifically indicated in          b(i). and b(ii) above ("New Cards"), shall be mutually agreed upon in          writing.

c.       During Period One, Card expiration shall be determined by the                   date Schoolpop places an Order (the "Order") and provides full                   payment and clearance of funding. During Period Two, Card Life                   shall be determined by the date Schoolpop places an Order.

d.       Should any Card expire or lose Card Life prior to                   distribution, Schoolpop shall assume all loss associated with                   the Card funding, if applicable, and shall pay AEIS a $2.00                   per Card destruction fee. Schoolpop shall not return such                   Cards to AEIS, and shall follow the destruction process as                   detailed in the Trust Agreement.

e.       Card Life shall be unaffected by the termination of this                   Agreement.

f.       From the Effective Date through September 30, 2004, Schoolpop                   may order non-standard Encompass(R) Select denominations                   (other than 25, 50, 75, and 100 Points) up to a maximum of 200                   Points. Such non-standard Encompass(R) Select denominations                   require eight (8) weeks to fulfill and must be ordered in                   boxes of 100 Cards of like denominations. Schoolpop shall                   discontinue reselling Encompass(R) Select Cards on December                   31, 2004 and shall effectively manage and forecast                   Encompass(R) Select Card needs to deplete such inventory as of                   December 31, 2004. In the event that any unsold Encompass(R)                   Select Cards remain in inventory by Schoolpop on December 31,                   2004, Schoolpop shall provide to AEIS, no later than January                   5, 2005, the Encompass(R) Select Card numbers, the respective                   expiration dates and denominations of the Cards. AEIS shall                   invoice Schoolpop for the applicable Card destruction fees                   which shall be payable by Schoolpop within thirty days (30) of                   receipt of invoice. Such Card list shall be submitted on a                   disk/CD and shall be sent via a form of shipment where                   signature is required upon delivery.

g.       Effective with Period Two, Schoolpop shall provide to AEIS a                   twelve (12) month sold Card forecast and Card inventory                   forecast (hereinafter defined). In addition, Schoolpop shall                   provide AEIS with a monthly forecast, no later than the third                   business day of each month, of the number of Cards to be sold                   to its clients, ("Sold Card Forecast") as well as the number                   of Cards to be stocked in inventory, ("Card Inventory                   Forecast"), (collectively referred to as the "Forecasts") for                   the month, ninety-days out. For example, Schoolpop shall                   provide AEIS with the Card Inventory Forecast and Sold Card                   Forecast in August for the month of November. The Forecasts                   will be relied on, ("Locked") at the time they are reported.

h.       Changes to the Forecasts within the Locked period are                   expected. However, any changes to Locked Forecasts will not                   impact any applicable penalties as detailed below in                   subsections (i) and (j). AEIS will place reliance on the                   Forecasts provided by Schoolpop to align resources and ensure                   adequate production, fulfillment and customer service                   capabilities. Schoolpop shall provide AEIS with any changes to                   the Locked Forecasts on a monthly basis including any                   respective changes to either Forecast for the remaining twelve                   (12) month period.

i.       In any consecutive three (3) month period in which the                   difference between the Card Inventory Forecast less the actual                   Card Order volume for that period is a shortage of ten percent                   or greater (10%+), AEIS reserves the right to assess a                   penalty, ("Card Inventory Penalty") of sixteen and one-half                   cents ($0.165) per Card for such difference as detailed in                   Examples 1 and 2 below.

j.       In any given month where the difference between the Sold Card                   Forecast less the actual Card activation volume, ("Cards in                   Force") is a shortage of ten percent or greater (10%+), AEIS                   reserves the right to assess a penalty, the ("Customer Service                   Penalty") which shall be calculated by converting Cards in                   Force into call volume minutes as follows:

i.       Cards in Force times the call to card ratio times the                            average handle time equals the total call volume                            minutes. AEIS will calculate the respective product's                            average year-to-date call to Card ratio and the                            average year-to-date handle time monthly to calculate                            the call volume minutes. For purposes of example, the                            year-to-date through August 2004, Encompass(R) Select                            average call to Card ratio is 2.43 and the average                            handle time is 4.0 minutes.

&sbsp;      ii.      Actual call volume minutes under 90% of the Card Sold                            Forecast will be charged at 90% of Locked Rolling                            Forecast at the standard rate of $0.50 per minute.                            Schoolpop's Customer Service Penalty shall be                            calculated at the difference between actual call                            volume minutes and 90% of Card Sold Forecast call                            volume minutes.

iii.     The Customer Service Penalty shall be calculated                            based upon the a) call volume minutes plus b) Cards                            in Force as detailed in the example below:

l.       Schoolpop shall pay AEIS all incurred penalties within thirty                   (30) days of receipt of invoice for such penalties by AEIS.

m.       At any given time during this Agreement, Schoolpop's inactive                   Card inventory shall be limited to $3,000,000 in Card value as                   determined by the Point denomination on each Card. This limit                 &sbsp; shall consist of a maximum Card value of $1,500,000 in                   Encompass(R) Select Cards and $1,500,000 Card value in any                   other product (s). Effective January 1, 2005, after which                   Encompass(R) Select shall no longer be available to Schoolpop,                   the maximum inactive Card value shall not exceed $3,000,000 in                   any combination of products at any given time. In the event                   that Schoolpop exceeds either of these limits, AEIS shall                   cease fulfilling Orders from Schoolpop until such time that                   Schoolpop's inventory returns to an acceptable level based on                   the established maximums.





n.       Any New Cards shall be excluded from the forecasting and                   penalty provisions of this Section 3 for the three (3) month                   period commencing on the date of the first order of such New                   Cards.

4.       CARD ISSUANCE

a.       Schoolpop agrees that it will review all requests for each                   Program requested by the Client and will use reasonable and                   customary business practices to qualify and recommend Clients                   proposed for a Program. Schoolpop shall take commercially                   reasonable efforts to ensure all information requested for a                   Client is true, accurate and correct.

b.       AEIS may, from time to time, provide Schoolpop with                   commercially reasonable qualification standards for Clients.                   Schoolpop shall not knowingly submit an Order to AEIS on                   behalf of any Client that does not meet any such standards.                   Schoolpop agrees that it will sell Cards only to Clients and                   only for use in connection with a bona fide fund raising                   program. Schoolpop will not knowingly sell Cards to any Client                   who does not meet any AEIS qualification standard(s) or to any

3

Client or potential Client that Schoolpop has reason to believe would          be unsatisfactory to AEIS.

c.       AEIS reserves the right at any time, with or without cause,                   with reasonable written notice to Schoolpop, to cancel or                   decline any Client's participation in the Program.

d.       AEIS may, at its sole discretion, decline to provide Cards to                   Clients.

e.       Cards are intended for use in the United States and must be                   designated for receipt of shipment within the United States.

f.       AEIS' designated vendor will be responsible for shipping Cards                   in accordance with Schoolpop's instructions.

g.       AEIS's designated vendor will ship the Cards as follows:

i.       During Period One, AEIS' designated vendor will use                            reasonable commercial efforts to ship the Cards as                            detailed below, following receipt and clearance by                            AEIS of Card Funding.

All shipment timelines are subject to change                            without notice due to seasonal or unforecasted                            production volume and AEIS shall work with its Card                            production vendor and use reasonable commercial                            efforts to secure the most favorable shipment date                            commitment and shall notify Schoolpop accordingly.

h.       One point is worth one (1) U.S. Dollar ($1.00 USD) ("Point").

i.       AEIS shall ship Cards in bulk shipment via its designated                   vendor to Schoolpop, F.O.B. Atlanta, Georgia. Schoolpop shall                   distribute to each Cardholder the Cardholder agreement as                   provided with each Card and which includes instructions on                   "How to Use the Card". Should Schoolpop or its Client                   distribute Cards without such Cardholder agreement, Schoolpop                   shall indemnify and hold harmless AEIS, its parents,                   subsidiaries and their respective affiliates, officers,                   directors, employees and agents, against any and all Loss,                   hereinafter defined, that AEIS may incur or be subjected to as                   a result of such action, including, without limitation, any                   claims brought by any entity including but not limited to                   governmental entities and Cardholders.

j.       Purchases made with a Card having insufficient Points will be                   deemed a deniable transaction. The correct way to handle the                   purchase is described in the Cardholder agreement. If there is                   a purchase made on a Card where there are insufficient Points                   on the Card, the negative amount will be the responsibility of                   the person whose signature appears on the Card, as described                   in the Cardholder agreement.





k.       CARDS LOST OR STOLEN IN TRANSIT IN THE INITIAL SHIPMENT FROM                   AEIS WILL BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF AEIS. The full risk of loss                   for ordered Cards shall pass to Schoolpop immediately upon                   their delivery to Schoolpop by AEIS and AEIS shall not                   reimburse Schoolpop or Client for any delivered Card that is                   lost, stolen, misappropriated, or that otherwise disappears or                   is fraudulently or inappropriately used (together referred to                   as "Loss"). Schoolpop shall remain solely liable for any Loss                   caused by the negligence or willful misconduct of its                   employees, agents or representatives after the shipment has                   been received by Schoolpop. AEIS will not reimburse Schoolpop                   or its Client or be responsible for any Loss in connection                   with or after delivery of Cards to Schoolpop, its Clients or                   the Cardholder whether they are shipped to Schoolpop, its                   Client, or to either of their pre-designated delivery agents.                   Only Cardholders are eligible to receive replacements from                   AEIS and replacements are given only in accordance with the                   agreement between the Cardholder and AEIS. Cards are usually                   shipped in packaging with AEIS' designated vendor as the                   return address. Notwithstanding the foregoing, AEIS shall bear                   no risk of Loss and of non-receipt of Cards by the intended                   Cardholder in the event that AEIS is instructed to use another                   address as the return address, the address provided to AEIS                   for Schoolpop or the Client was incorrect, the request for the                   Card was unauthorized, and/or any information received by AEIS                   with regard to the processing of the Order was fraudulent or                   incorrect.

l.       All agreements entered into between Schoolpop and its Clients,                   shall contain a provision substantially similar to the                   preceding Section 3 (k).

Schoolpop                   and Schoolpop's Clients shall establish and maintain an                   anti-money laundering program with an assigned compliance                   officer and compliance program.

Both parties acknowledge that they may have access to or                   receive confidential information, data, and materials about                   the other party, their Clients and Cardholders, and their                   entities, including, without limitation, marketing                   philosophies and objectives, pricing information, business                   materials and data, processes, customer lists, product                   information, financial data, competitive advantages and                   disadvantages, and other confidential information received                   ("Confidential Information"), and that disclosure or misuses                   of such Confidential Information, would be irreparably                   damaging to the other party. Accordingly, both parties agree                   to receive and hold in confidence all Confidential Information                   considered proprietary or confidential by the other party, and                 &sbsp; agree not to disclose or use such information in any manner                   except for uses contemplated by this Agreement unless                   permitted in writing in advance by the other party (except for                   information disclosed to Cardholders in accordance with the                   Cardholder Agreement). Both parties also agree to bind their                   employees, and subcontractors to compliance with this                   paragraph and to take all other reasonable action to ensure                   protection of the Confidential Information.

c.       Such Confidential Information is subject to the terms and                   conditions of this Agreement, if (a) such Confidential                   Information is either Party's marketing philosophies and                   objectives, financial and pricing information, Client lists,                   business processes or competitive advantages and                   disadvantages; (b) such Confidential Information is disclosed                   verbally and is verbally identified as proprietary or                   confidential at the time of disclosure, and there exists a                   written record that such Confidential Information was                   disclosed and identified verbally as proprietary or                   confidential; or (c) such Confidential Information is in                   written, graphic or electronic form when disclosed and the                   media that contains such Confidential Information is clearly                   marked "confidential" or "proprietary", or something                   substantially similar. Notwithstanding the foregoing,                   Confidential Information shall not include (d) information                   that is publicly known, already known by, or in the possession                   of the non-disclosing party, or (e) is independently developed                   by the non-disclosing party without use or reference to the                   other party's Confidential Information, or (f) is rightly

9

obtained by the non-disclosing party from a source other than                   the disclosing party without such restrictions.

d.       Each party agrees that during the term of this Agreement and                   thereafter (a) it will use Confidential Information belonging                   to the other party solely for purposes outlined in this                   Agreement, (subject to the terms and conditions thereof), (b)                   it will not disclose Confidential Information belonging to the                   other Party to any third party other than the receiving                   Party's employees, affiliates, agents, permitted vendors,                   subcontractors and/or professional advisors on a need-to-know                   basis who are advised of the confidential nature of the                   Confidential Information and under a similar confidentiality                   agreement, and (c) each Party will treat the Confidential                   Information of the other Party with the same care that the                   receiving party normally affords its own proprietary and                   confidential information. If any such employee, affiliate,                   agent, subcontractor or professional advisor discloses or uses                   the Confidential Information in a manner not permitted under                   this Agreement, the party disclosing the Confidential                   Information to such employee, affiliate, agent, subcontractor                   or professional advisor will be liable therefore. If either                   party is required by law to disclose Confidential Information,                   it may be disclosed, provided that, unless prohibited,                   sufficient prior notice is given to the non-disclosing party                   to afford it an opportunity to take whatever steps it deems                   necessary to protect the confidential nature of the                   Confidential Information. In the event a party is required to                   disclose the other party's Confidential Information in                   connection with any judicial proceeding or government                   investigation, a notification of such requirement shall                   promptly occur allowing a reasonable time for the appropriate                   party to seek a protective Order from the appropriate court or                   government agency. Thereafter, Confidential Information may be                   disclosed to the extent required by law, subject to any                   applicable protective Order.

e.       Upon request of the other party, each party will promptly





return to the other any or all Confidential Information of the                   other then in its possession or under its control provided,                   however, that each party may retain one copy of all such                   Confidential Information solely for its own internal records,                   such Confidential Information to remain subject to the                   restrictions on use and disclosure contained in this Agreement

Schoolpop acknowledges that it will likely                   receive private information ("PI") from Authorized Users that                   will be subject to various privacy laws and regulations in the                   various States in which the Authorized Users and the parties                   hereto reside.

To safeguard all Cards received by Seller at all times,                   including inactive and active Cards and when the Cards are in                   transit, as a prudent financial or commercial institution                   should safeguard a like amount of its own cash.

To notify AEIS at destination indicated on the Acknowledgement                   of Receipt Form, as soon as possible upon any loss of the                   Cards due to theft, burglary, fire or other cause. All                   notifications of loss must include the Card number for all                   lost Card stock. In the event an entire shipment was lost, the                   Card tracking number must also be provided. AEIS reserves the                   right to hold Seller liable for any loss, as to which Seller                   might not otherwise have been liable for under subparagraph                   2(k) below, if Seller has unreasonably delayed reporting the                   loss to AEIS, and such delay has disadvantaged AEIS or                   prejudiced AEIS' ability to mitigate or eliminate its damages.

14

j.       To maintain accurate records of all Cards sold or held in                   inventory, including Card numbers, shipment tracking numbers,





account numbers, and the Acknowledgement Receipt form, etc.

k.       To be responsible for any loss of any Cards received in                   accordance with subsection (a) above prior to the time such                   Cards are paid for by Seller, whether such loss occurs by                   theft, burglary, hold-up, fire, dishonesty of employees,                   mysterious disappearance, or any other cause irrespective of                   such cause. In the case of loss of Cards, Seller shall pay                   AEIS from time to time upon demand the amount of any Cards so                   reported as lost and later used at any merchant or other                   location or otherwise appear for sale for any reason                   whatsoever. Seller shall be fully liable for the amounts paid                   by AEIS and/or their affiliates with respect to such Cards                   together with any additional reasonable costs incurred by AEIS                   and/or their affiliates arising out of such Cards. Such                   liability shall survive termination of this Agreement.

l.       Not to sell Cards on credit or post-paid method of any kind to                   any individual, company, or entity whatsoever nor to utilize                   the Cards for the benefit of Seller, Seller's owners,                   officers, employees, representatives or any third party.

m.       To increase Seller's inventory of Cards by following AEIS'                   process.

n.       To destroy Cards for purposes of past expiration or reason                   other than termination that causes Seller to remove from                   inventory. Such Cards must be completely destroyed by                   cremating or shredding to the point where such Cards cannot be                   reconstructed in any way or Card numbers cannot be read in any                   way. Such destruction must be evidenced by execution of AEIS'                   Destruction Certificate, which is attached hereto as Schedule                   II. The Destruction Certificate shall be executed by Seller                   through two authorized signatures and shall particularly                   describe the Cards by (1) Card product name, (2) Card number,                   (3) denomination, (4) shipment tracking number, and (5)                   quantity by product and denomination, and account number.                   Seller shall pay AEIS associated destruction fees for such                   Card destruction as detailed within the Destruction                   Certificate. In the event any Cards certified as destroyed by                   Seller are later used at any establishment or other location                   or otherwise appear for sale for any reason whatsoever, Seller                   shall be fully liable for the amounts paid by AEIS and/or                   their affiliates with respect to such Cards together with any                   additional costs incurred by AEIS and/or their affiliates                   arising out of such Cards. In no event shall Seller throw away                   discard expired or spoiled or otherwise unwanted Cards in any                   other manner than described in this Section 2(n). Such                   liability shall survive termination of this Agreement.

o.       To pass to a security audit as performed by AEIS and/or their                   appointed representatives of AEIS or American Express Travel                   Related Services Inc. at a time and frequency solely                   determined by AEIS during the term of this Agreement. This                   Agreement shall be terminated by AEIS at AEIS' choice                   immediately upon Seller receiving a non-passing status of such                   security audit. AEIS may chose to allow Seller to conform to                   non-passing elements of security audit within a time so                   specified by AEIS in writing to Seller. Seller shall choose to                   make necessary changes to conform to the security audit or                   terminate the Agreement as so indicated in Section 4 below.

3.       This Agreement (a) may not be assigned by Seller without the written          consent of AEIS, except to an entity controlling, controlled by or          under common control with Seller, provided, however, Schoolpop shall          remain liable for the obligations contained herein including the          attachments and Exhibits thereto, and (b) may be modified only by an          agreement in writing signed on behalf of AEIS by an executive officer.          No other employees of AEIS have authority to modify or waive any term          of this Agreement. This Agreement may be assigned by AEIS to any          parent, subsidiary, affiliated or associate corporation without          Seller's consent and shall, whether or not so assigned, inure to the          benefit of any AEIS parent, subsidiary, associate or affiliate thereof          which pays or becomes liable upon any Cards delivered to Seller under          this Agreement.

4.       This Agreement shall remain in force until terminated by either party          by notice given in accordance with paragraph 8, below and in accordance          with Section 14(h) of the Agreement.

a.       Notices so given shall, unless otherwise specified                            therein, be effective upon receipt whereupon both                            parties shall cooperate in an effective wrap up of                            all outstanding issues and transition of inventory                            and other termination responsibilities as determined                            by AEIS.

b.       Upon such termination, Seller shall forthwith remit                            to AEIS or their agents all unsold Cards and shall                            safeguard such Cards during transit to AEIS in such a                            manner as detailed in Section 2(h) herein.

5.       The rights of AEIS hereunder shall not be prejudiced or restricted by





any time given or forbearance extended to Seller in the enforcement of          its rights and no waiver by AEIS of their rights in respect of any          breach hereof by Seller shall be deemed to operate as a waiver in          respect of any subsequent breach hereof.

6.       It is agreed between the parties that if any provision of this          Agreement is held to be invalid, the remainder of this Agreement shall          continue in full force and effect and shall be binding and effective on          the parties thereto.

AEIS MERCHANT APPROVAL GUIDELINES AND PROCESS

INTRODUCTION / OVERVIEW

The AEIS Communications Group requires review of any new or revised materials, which include any mention of Merchant Partners -- in order to ensure proper merchant guidelines. This includes ALL advertising, promotional and marketing materials in any medium (INCLUDING: COMMUNICATIONS, ADVERTISING, SALES PROMOTION COLLATERAL, DIRECT MAIL, PRESS RELEASES, VIDEOS, WEB SITES, PROMOTIONAL ITEMS, SALES PRESENTATIONS AND SIMILAR MATERIALS.) Copy and layout should be submitted as early as possible. Due to the type of communications piece, approval could take anywhere from 3 to 10 business days.

MERCHANT SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION FOR APPROVAL GUIDELINES

Consumer applications are typically more involved. Generally, consumer programs are targeted to a wider audience; therefore, the implications are greater for the merchant. For this reason, the merchants mandate that AEIS seek individual approvals from each and every merchant.

Any standard applications using customized collateral should be reviewed by AEIS for content and accuracy. Even in the cases where standard program materials are to be used, AEIS will need to internally review any customized announcements and/or teasers. More than likely, these pieces feature only merchant names or merchant lists in print and can typically be approved within 24-48 hours.

Pieces using only select groups of merchants, photos or logos will generally require a higher level of approval and depending on the merchants used, may require approval from the merchant as well. The approval timeline will range from three to ten (3-10) business days for existing/ongoing.

Once, layout and copy are approved by AEIS Communications Group, Merchant Partnerships, Operations and American Express, any ongoing and additional changes must also be approved.

IMAGES, LOGOS, PRODUCT PATENT, AND REGISTERED/SERVICE MARKS

IMAGES AND LOGOS The following are examples of merchant image and logo usage, which require merchant approval through Merchant Partnerships:

o        Any communication or collateral, whether standard or customized,          containing merchant images or logos must be reviewed by Merchant          Partnerships o        Any new design work of merchant logos and images not previously          approved o        Use of standard merchant logos in any color other than the original          color o        Unique positioning of merchant images - surrounding merchants, etc.





o        "Direct mail" pieces, which include merchant references when only          "select" merchants are referenced. o        Unusual type of creative print work such as posters o        Borders around logos and busy backgrounds o        Any copy or tag-lines not previously approved o        Under no circumstances are press release photos to be used on or in          association with any form of communication relating to incentive card          programs unless approved by Merchant Partnerships' contact. o        Images and/or logos are not to be altered (cropped, inset, or overlaid)          unless approved by Merchant Partnerships' contact. o        All images used in magazine format must be obtain merchant copy write          information next to the image

MERCHANT PARTNERSHIPS RESERVES THE RIGHT TO REMOVE IMAGES AT ANY TIME          THAT MAY BE DEEMED INAPPROPRIATE REPRESENTATION OF THE MERCHANT (THIS          INCLUDES OUTDATED OR SEASONAL IMAGES AND LOGOS).

ALL QUESTIONS REGARDING MERCHANT COMMUNICATION APPROVAL SHOULD BE          SUBMITTED TO ANN FINK AT ANN.FINK@AEIS.COM, 636-226-2043.
