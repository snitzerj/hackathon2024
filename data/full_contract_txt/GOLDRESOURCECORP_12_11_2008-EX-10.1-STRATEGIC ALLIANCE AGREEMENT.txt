If HOC wishes to exercise the Option, it shall give written notice to the Company (the "Option Exercise Notice") prior to the Option Expiration Date in the manner set forth in Section 12.1 of this Agreement. If HOC fails to deliver the Option Exercise Notice on or before the Option Expiration Date, HOC shall be deemed to have waived its rights under this Section 2.1. In the event HOC exercises the Option, one or more of the HOC Entities shall subscribe and pay for and the Company shall issue to the relevant HOC Entities, free and clear of any liens or encumbrances, the Additional Shares and the Parties shall exchange representations and warranties substantially similar to those contained in the Subscription Agreement and execute such documents as may be necessary to complete the subscription and sale of the Additional Shares. Closing of the purchase and sale of the Additional Shares shall take place within ten (10) business days of the delivery of the Option Exercise Notice, such date being referred to as the "Subsequent Closing Date".

2.2 Use of Proceeds. In the event HOC exercises the Option, the Company agrees to use not less than five million U.S. Dollars (US$5,000,000) of the proceeds from the subscription of the Purchased Shares and the Additional Shares to fund exploration activities (including but not limited to drilling, assaying and staking new claims) on the El Aguila project. The Company further agrees that the balance of the proceeds from the subscription of the Purchased Shares and the Additional Shares shall be used as follows: (i) ten million U.S. Dollars (US$10,000,000) to fund the development and construction of the mine and plant for the El Aguila project; and (ii) three million U.S. Dollars (US$3,000,000) for working capital of the Company and other investments in the El Aguila project.

2.3. Additional Financing. Subject to the provisions of Section 8.2, if the Company determines to solicit additional equity financing subsequent to exercise of the Option but prior to Commencement of Production (hereinafter defined) at the El Aguila project, it shall provide written notice to that effect to HOC and HOC shall be entitled to exclusively provide such financing upon the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth. For purposes of the preceding sentence, "Commencement of Production" shall be defined as the production and delivery to the point of sale (refiner) by the Company (either directly or through a subsidiary) of not less than 4,000 ounces of gold within a 45 day period. HOC shall have ten (10) Business Days from delivery of such notice in which to notify the Company that it desires to provide all of such financing (the "Financing Election"). If HOC delivers the Financing Election, the purchase price for each share shall be equal to eighty percent (80%) of the average closing price of the Shares during the thirty (30) calendar days preceding the date HOC delivers the Financing Election. Closing of the subscription, purchase and sale shall be at such place and time as the Parties agree but not more than ten (10) days from delivery of the Financing Election. If HOC delivers the Financing Election, one or more of the HOC Entities shall pay the purchase price for, and the Company shall issue, additional Shares, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances. The Parties shall exchange representations and warranties, in form and in substance substantially similar to those provided in the Subscription Agreement and execute such documents as may be necessary to complete the subscription and sale of the Shares.

ARTICLE 4  PRE-EMPTIVE RIGHT

4.1 HOC's Pre-emptive Right.

(a) Subject to the provisions of subsection (g) of this Section 4.1 and Section 8.2 hereof, if at any time after the Closing Date, the Company proposes to issue or sell Equity Securities ("Additional Securities") other than (i) under any Stock Option Plan, (ii) pursuant to the exercise of options under any Stock Option Plan, (iii) upon the exercise, exchange or conversion of any Convertible Securities, or (iv) for property other than money, the HOC Entities shall have the right to subscribe for and purchase Additional Securities, at the price at which such Additional Securities are offered for sale to other purchasers (the "Other Purchasers"), up to its Pro Rata Interest (as defined below) prior to giving effect to the issuance or sale of such Additional Securities. "Pro Rata Interest" means, at any relevant time, the ownership interest of HOC, expressed as a percentage, equal to: (i) the number of outstanding shares of common stock of the Company ("Common Stock") beneficially owned by the HOC Entities, including all shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion, exercise or exchange of all Convertible Securities beneficially owned by the HOC Entities divided by (ii) the aggregate number of outstanding shares of Common Stock, plus the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion, exercise or exchange of all outstanding Convertible Securities;

(b) If the Company issues Equity Securities in circumstances that would not give rise to the rights of the HOC Entities pursuant to Section 4.1(a) (the "Non-Participating Transaction"), then in any concurrent or subsequent transaction which does give rise to the rights of the HOC Entities pursuant to Section 4.1(a) (the "Participating Transaction"), the Company shall allow the HOC Entities to subscribe for and purchase Additional Securities in an amount greater than HOC's Pro Rata Interest; provided that in the Participating Transaction, HOC shall not be entitled to purchase any more than its Pro Rata Interest of the securities sold collectively in the Non-Participating Transaction and the Participating Transaction.

(c) If the Company intends to authorize and/or issue equity securities that give rise to the rights of HOC pursuant to Section 4.1(a), the Company shall provide notice to HOC (the "Rights Notice") no less than ten (10) business days before the date on which the Company intends to issue equity securities giving rise to the rights of HOC in Section 4.1(a).

(d) The Rights Notice shall specify sufficient information regarding the particulars of the issuance or sale of the Additional Securities to allow HOC to make a reasoned decision in respect of making the investment, including to the extent any such terms are determinable at such time: (i) the total number of equity securities outstanding as of the date thereof; (ii) the total number of Additional Securities which are being offered; (iii) the rights, privileges, restrictions, terms and conditions of such Additional Securities; (iv) the amount payable by HOC for the Additional Securities to which it is entitled pursuant to Section 4.1(a); and (v) the proposed closing date, and thereafter, to the extent it is not included in the Rights Notice, the Company shall immediately provide notice to HOC of such information as it is determined.

(e) HOC shall give notice (an "Acceptance Notice") to the Company not later than 5:00 p.m. (Denver time) on the tenth business day following the deemed receipt of any Rights Notice given under paragraph 4.1(c) setting out the number of Additional Securities, if any, which any of HOC Entities intends to subscribe for and purchase and, if applicable, the name and address of HOC Entity whose name in which such securities should be registered, provided that if HOC, acting reasonably, determines that it has insufficient information to make such investment decision, HOC shall notify the Company of the information required to make such investment decision and thereafter shall have the longer of (i) the remainder of the ten (10) Business Days set out in the first sentence of this paragraph; or (ii) two (2) Business Days from the receipt of such additional information to make the investment decision and deliver or refrain from delivering the Acceptance Notice. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Rights Notice shall be deemed to include sufficient information to make such investment decision if it includes the information specified in items (i) to (iv) of Section 4.1(d). If no Acceptance Notice has been provided to the Company within the required time, HOC will be deemed to have elected not to subscribe for or purchase any such Additional Securities.

7





(f) Following delivery of the Acceptance Notice, if any, the HOC Entities shall pay for, and the Company shall issue to the relevant HOC Entities, free and clear of any liens, the number of Additional Securities specified in the Acceptance Notice and, except as otherwise agreed, the Company shall provide HOC with substantially the same closing documents, including opinions, if applicable, as are delivered to the other persons subscribing for Additional Securities on the closing date for such issuance.

(g) The rights granted to HOC under this Article 4 shall terminate and be of no further force or effect if HOC does not exercise Option and complete the purchase of the Additional Shares.

ARTICLE 5 BOARD REPRESENTATION

5.1 Appointment of HOC Nominee. If, but only if HOC exercises the Option and completes the acquisition of the Additional Shares, HOC shall be entitled to nominate one (1) individual to the Board of Directors (the "HOC Director"). Upon receipt of such nomination and its satisfaction that the individual nominated by HOC meets the qualification requirements for directors under applicable laws, the Board of Directors further agrees to expand its membership to four (4) positions and appoint the individual nominated by HOC to the newly-created vacancy. The Board of Directors further agrees that if HOC maintains a Pro Rata Interest of at least 14.5%, it shall nominate such individual to the slate of directors at each subsequent annual meeting so long as the provisions of Section 8.2 are not invoked.

5.2 Increase in Membership of the Board of Directors. If HOC acquires the Additional Shares and subsequently acquires additional Shares such that it holds a Pro Rata Interest of 40% or more, HOC shall be entitled to appoint one (1) additional individual to the Board of Directors. For greater clarity, if HOC exercises the Option and holds a Pro Rata Interest of at least 40%, HOC shall be entitled to appoint a total of two (2) individuals to the Board of Directors. Upon receipt of a nomination from HOC for the second director and its satisfaction that the individual meets the qualification requirements for directors under applicable law, the Board of Directors agrees to expand its membership to five positions and appoint the individual nominated by HOC to the newly created vacancy. The Board of Directors further agrees that so long as HOC maintains a Pro Rata Interest of at least 35%, it shall nominate such individual to the slate of directors at each subsequent annual meeting so long as the provisions of Section 8.2 are not invoked. The Company further agrees that if HOC exercises the Option and so long as the provisions of Section 8.2 are not invoked, it will not take any action to authorize and will cause the Board of Directors not to authorize any proposal to expand the Board beyond five (5) members without the advance written approval of HOC.

8





5.3 Board Meetings.

In providing such notice, the Company shall take into consideration the matters to be discussed at the meeting, the proximity to the place of the meeting and the time zone in which the HOC Director is resident.

5.4 Resignation of HOC Director(s). If (x) one or both HOC Directors do not meet the individual qualifications for a director prescribed by applicable laws, (y) the Pro Rata Interest of HOC falls below 14.5%, or (z) the provisions of Section 8.2 hereof become applicable and the Company delivers notice to HOC to that effect, all of the HOC Directors shall forthwith resign; provided, however, that in the event of (x), HOC shall then be entitled to appoint an individual to replace the resigning director(s) and such resigning director(s) shall be afforded the benefits of any indemnity and insurance as may exist for all matters occurring prior to such resignation.

5.5 Indemnification and Director's and Officer's Insurance. So long as HOC is entitled to nominate and maintain a director pursuant to this Article 5, the Company shall indemnify each current and former HOC Director and shall maintain director's and officer's liability insurance for the benefit of each such director, with the same rights and benefits as are accorded the directors of the Company generally.

ARTICLE 6  RIGHT OF FIRST OFFER

The provisions of this Article 6 shall apply if, but only if, HOC exercises the Option and acquires the Additional Shares and so long as the provisions of Section 8.2 do not apply:

6.1 Joint Venture

  (a) If the Company or any of its Subsidiaries decides to seek a joint venture partner to develop, acquire or otherwise earn an interest in any Properties including the Existing Properties, in circumstances where the Company's participation in such joint venture is not dependent on the participation of a particular third party as joint venture partner (such as in the case of an earn-in) (each a "Proposed Joint Venture"), the Company shall immediately provide notice to HOC (the "Joint Venture Proposal Notice") specifying sufficient information regarding the particulars of the Proposed Joint Venture to allow HOC to make a reasoned decision in respect of participating in the Proposed Joint Venture, including to the extent any such terms are determinable at such time: (A) a description of the Property in respect of which the Proposed Joint Venture relates, and (B) the terms, including the purchase price, for the Proposed Joint Venture, and if applicable, a true copy of any related term sheet setting forth such terms.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 6.1 shall prevent the Company from concurrently negotiating with third parties with respect to those matters set out in this Section 6.1.

  (b) If HOC, acting reasonably, determines that the Joint Venture Proposal Notice contains insufficient information to make a reasoned decision in respect of participating in the Proposed Joint Venture, it shall notify the Company of the information required to make such decision and thereafter shall have the greater of (i) five (5) Business Days from the receipt of such information from the Company, and (ii) the days remaining in the period specified in Section 6.2 to make such decision and deliver or refrain from delivering the HOC JV Acceptance Notice in accordance with such Section 6.2.

If HOC does not provide HOC JV Acceptance Notice to the Company within fifteen (15) Business Days or such shorter period as may be specified in the Joint Venture Proposal Notice, of receiving of the Joint Venture Proposal Notice, the Company may enter into negotiations with any other person regarding the Proposed Joint Venture. If the Company truncates the period during which the HOC JV Acceptance Notice is required to be returned by HOC, it shall include in the Joint Venture Proposal Notice a statement certified by an officer of the Company that the Company has determined that it is necessary to truncate such period to avoid losing the opportunity to make such acquisition or other related transaction and that it has used commercially reasonable efforts to avoid truncating such period.

  (i) initiate, solicit, promote or encourage, directly or indirectly, inquiries or the submission of proposals or offers from any Person with respect to any proposal or offer or action that would reasonably be expected to delay, prevent or frustrate the Transactions or any part thereof (an "Alternative Proposal");

  (ii) encourage, or participate or engage in negotiations concerning, or furnish to any Person other than to HOC Entities, any non-public information with respect to, or otherwise co-operate in any way with, or participate in, or facilitate or encourage any Person to make an Alternative Proposal; or

  (iii) endorse, accept, approve or recommend a proposal of, or enter into any Contract or understanding with , any Person relating to an Alternative Proposal, or otherwise facilitate any effort or attempt to make or implement an Alternative Proposal.

  (b) Notwithstanding anything else in this Section 9.1, if the Company or any of its subsidiaries receives an unsolicited Alternative Proposal prior to the Option Exercise Date, the Board of Directors may participate in discussions with, furnish information to, or enter into an agreement with the Person that initiated the Alternative Proposal only if: (x) the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that such action is necessary in order for them to act in a manner consistent with their fiduciary duty under applicable Laws; (y) the Company shall have provided to HOC notice at least five (5) Business Days prior to the date on which the agreement to effect such Alternative Proposal is to be entered into specifying the terms of the Alternative Proposal; and (z) after taking into account modifications to this Agreement proposed by HOC during such five Business Day period, such proposal would constitute a superior proposal ("Superior Proposal"). If HOC makes a proposal to amend this Agreement to increase the purchase price payable for the Additional Shares, such that the proposal of such other Person shall no longer be a Superior Proposal, and shall complete the purchase of the Additional Shares upon such terms, then neither the Company nor its subsidiaries shall enter into such Alternative Proposal.

13





  (c) The Company shall comply with all securities regulatory filing requirements on a timely basis in connection with the issuance of any Equity Securities of the Company to any HOC Entity, including filing within the periods stipulated under Securities Laws, at the Company's expense, all private placement forms required to be filed by the Company and paying all filing fees required to be paid in connection therewith so that such issuance may lawfully occur without the necessity of filing a prospectus, registration statement or any similar document under the Securities Laws.

  (d) The Company shall, to the extent and for so long as HOC Entities hold at least 14.5% of the Shares on a non-diluted basis, upon HOC's request, permit representatives of the HOC Entities to have access to the site and any of the premises where the business and operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries are conducted and access and duplicating rights (and use commercially reasonable efforts to cause persons or firms possessing such documentation or information to give similar access and duplicating rights) to the Company and its Subsidiaries' books of account and records and such other documents, communications, items and matters, within the knowledge, possession or control of the Company, which HOC may reasonably request, at HOC's own cost (other than those it is permitted to examine and make copies of free of charge pursuant to applicable Laws) provided that, except to the extent the information can be provided in the necessary course of business of the Company, acting reasonably including to provide HOC Entities with information to assist the HOC Entities and their advisors with the preparation of the financial statements for such HOC Entities, nothing herein shall require the Company to provide HOC Entities with any information which would constitute a material fact with respect to the Company which has not been generally disclosed.

  (e) In the event the Company shall breach any representation or warranty, covenant or any other right of HOC under this Agreement in any material respect, including but not limited to, the rights afforded to HOC under Articles 2, 4, 5, 6 and 8 hereof, then at the request of HOC, the Company shall promptly prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-l or S-3 (or, if Form S-l or S-3 is not then available, on such form of registration statement as is then available to effect a registration for resale of the Purchase Shares and the Additional Shares ("Registration Statement")), covering the resale of all of the Shares owned by HOC; provided, however, that if prior to the filing of the Registration Statement, the provisions of Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act") allow the sale of all of the Shares in compliance with that Rule, the Company shall not be obligated to file such Registration Statement so long as the Company at its own expense, does the following: (i) complies with any necessary filing or reporting requirements (under the 1933 Act or otherwise) to permit such sale, (ii) cooperates with HOC in removing any legend on the certificates representing the Shares, including but not limited to instructing its transfer agent to remove such restrictive legend and (iii) provides HOC with an opinion of counsel confirming that such sale is permitted under Rule 144. Such Registration Statement also shall cover, to the extent allowable under the 1933 Act and the rules promulgated thereunder (including Rule 416), such indeterminate number of additional shares of Common Stock resulting from stock splits, stock dividends or similar transactions with respect to the Shares. The Company shall pay all expenses associated with the registration, including filing and printing fees, counsel and accounting fees and expenses, and State "Blue Sky" fees and expenses. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to have the Registration Statement declared effective by the SEC as soon as practicable. The Company shall notify HOC by facsimile or e-mail as promptly as practicable, and in any event, within three (3) business days, after the Registration Statement is declared effective and shall simultaneously provide HOC with copies of any related prospectus to be used in connection with the sale or other disposition of the securities covered thereby.

14





  (f) In connection with the foregoing, the Company shall indemnify and hold harmless HOC against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which it may become subject under the 1933 Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any other public filing by the Company, so long as such statement has not been provided to the Company by HOC for inclusion in such registration statement; (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, so long as such omission or alleged omission does not relate to HOC or the manner of sale for the Shares as provided to the Company by HOC; or (iii) any violation of the 1933 Act, any rule or regulation thereunder or any other securities law, rule or regulation applicable to the Company and relating to the action or inaction required of the Company in connection therewith. The foregoing indemnification obligation shall extend to the fees and expenses of any counsel retained by HOC in connection with any such loss, claim, damage or liability.
