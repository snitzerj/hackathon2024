Should Client's review             determine that Excite's XXXXXXXX results are inaccurate by 5% or             more, then Excite shall pay for all reasonable costs incurred by             Client for the review of Excite's records.

      d)    The usage reports provided by Excite to Client hereunder will be             deemed to be the Confidential Information of Excite.





      e)    The terms and conditions of this Agreement will be deemed to be             Confidential Information and will not be disclosed without the             written consent of the other party.

      f)    For the purposes of this Agreement, "User Data" means all             information pertaining to users referred to the Client Site from the             Excite Network during the term of the Agreement that is not             submitted by or collected from Users in connection with their             purchases or other interactive activities while signed on to the             Client Site. The parties acknowledge that any individual user of the             Internet could be a user of Excite and/or Client through activities             unrelated to this Agreement and that user data gathered independent             of this Agreement, even from individuals who are users of both             parties' services, will not be deemed to be "User Data" for the             purposes of this Agreement.

      g)    User Data will be deemed to be the joint property of the parties             and, subject to the limitations contained herein, both parties will             retain all rights to make use of any User Data obtained through this             Agreement.

      h)    Client will provide to Excite all User Data collected by Client             within thirty (30) days following the end of each calendar month             during the term of this Agreement in a mutually-determined             electronic format.

      i)    Client will not use User Data to directly or indirectly solicit any             Excite users either individually or in the aggregate during the term             of this Agreement and for a period of twelve (12) months following             the expiration or termination of this Agreement.

      j)    Neither party will sell, disclose, transfer or rent any User Data             which could reasonably be used to identify a specific named             individual ("Individual Data") to any third party nor will either             party use Individual Data on behalf of any third party without the             express permission of the individual user. Where user permission for             dissemination of Individual Data to third parties has been obtained,             each party will use commercially reasonable efforts to require the             third party recipients of Individual Data to provide an             "unsubscribe" feature in any email communications generated by, or             on behalf of, the third party recipients of Individual Data.

      k)    Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party may disclose Confidential             Information or User Data (i) to the extent required by a court of             competent jurisdiction or other governmental authority or otherwise             as required by law or (ii) on a "need-to-know" basis under an             obligation of confidentiality to its legal counsel, accountants,             banks and other financing sources and their advisors.

                                                                    CONFIDENTIAL

13.   INDEMNITY

      a)    Client will indemnify, defend and hold harmless Excite, its             affiliates, officers, directors, employees, consultants and agents             from any and all third party claims, liability, damages and/or costs             (including, but not limited to, attorneys fees) arising from:

      b)    Excite will indemnify, defend and hold harmless Client, its             affiliates, officers, directors, employees, consultants and agents             from any and all third party claims, liability, damages and/or costs             (including, but not limited to, attorneys fees) arising from:

                  i)    The breach of any representation or covenant in this                         Agreement; or

                  ii)   Any claim arising from the Excite Network other than                         content or services provided by Client.

                                                                    CONFIDENTIAL

      c)    EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER PARTY MAKES ANY             WARRANTY IN CONNECTION WITH THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT AND             HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ALL             IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR             PURPOSE REGARDING SUCH SUBJECT MATTER.

14.   LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

            EXCEPT UNDER SECTIONS 13(a) AND 13(b), IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY             BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL             DAMAGES, WHETHER BASED ON BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING             NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE, WHETHER OR NOT THAT PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED             OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

15.   DISPUTE RESOLUTION

      a)    The parties agree that any breach of either of the parties'             obligations regarding trademarks, service marks or trade names,             confidentiality and/or User Data would result in irreparable injury             for which there is no adequate remedy at law. Therefore, in the             event of any breach or threatened breach of a party's obligations             regarding trademarks, service marks or trade names or             confidentiality, the aggrieved party will be entitled to seek             equitable relief in addition to its other available legal remedies             in a court of competent jurisdiction.

      b)    In the event of disputes between the parties arising from or             concerning in any manner the subject matter of this Agreement, other             than disputes arising from or concerning trademarks, service marks             or trade names, confidentiality and/or User Data, the parties will             first attempt to resolve the dispute(s) through good faith             negotiation. In the event that the dispute(s) cannot be resolved             through good faith negotiation, the parties will refer the             dispute(s) to a mutually acceptable mediator.

      c)    In the event that disputes between the parties arising from or             concerning in any manner the subject matter of this Agreement, other             than disputes arising from or concerning trademarks, service marks             or trade names, confidentiality and/or User Data, cannot be resolved             through good faith negotiation and mediation, the parties will refer             the dispute(s) to the American Arbitration Association for             resolution through binding arbitration by a single arbitrator

                                       15

                                                                    CONFIDENTIAL

Any attempt to assign this             Agreement other than as permitted above will be null and void.

      b)    Governing Law. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in             accordance with the laws of the State of New York, notwithstanding             the actual state or country of residence or incorporation of Excite             or Client.

      e)    Force Majeure. Any delay in or failure of performance by either             party under this Agreement will not be considered a breach of this             Agreement and will be excused to the extent caused by any occurrence             beyond the reasonable control of such party including, but not             limited to, acts of God, power outages and governmental             restrictions.

      f)    Severability. In the event that any of the provisions of this             Agreement are held to be unenforceable by a court or arbitrator, the             remaining portions of the Agreement will remain in full force and             effect.
