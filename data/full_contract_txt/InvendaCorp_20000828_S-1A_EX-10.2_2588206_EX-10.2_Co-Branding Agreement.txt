     Members. The Co-Branded Application will include offers and other         content and functionality (Excite Content and e-centives Content,         collectively "Application Content") as further described in EXHIBIT B.

  b) Application Provider will design and create web pages containing the         Application Content ("Application Pages"). The Application Pages will be         presented in accordance with guidelines that Excite@Home will provide         Application Provider, which include, but are not limited to, page         performance standards and header and other design/user interface         standards. The Application Pages will prominently feature Excite@Home         branding and will be presented in a "look and feel" consistent with the         "look and feel" of the Excite Network. Excite@Home will have final         approval over all Application Pages. The Application Pages shall be         developed in accordance, in all material respects, with the requirements         established by EXHIBIT B.

  c) Application Provider will develop its category/directory structures to         be similar to those found on the Excite@Home Network and in accordance         with the requirements established by EXHIBIT B, SECTION 4.

  d) Application Provider will host the Co-Branded Application on its         Internet servers, but will serve the Co-Branded Application from an         "excite.com" masked domain name (or such other domain as Excite@Home may         elect at its sole option) so that Excite@Home can receive the reach and         page view credit. Application Provider will have sole responsibility for         providing and maintaining, at its expense, the Application Provider         Site, the Co-Branded Application, the Application Content (excluding the         provision of Excite Content), and any updates thereto.

  e) Each Co-Branded Page will include one or more links to the Excite         Network, as set forth in Section 3(d)  [INTEGRATION WITH EXCITE@HOME SERVICES]. Excite@Home will supply         Application Provider with the URLs for these links.

Excite@Home will respond to         change requests within seven (7) days of receipt, and any failure to so         respond shall be deemed an approval.

  g) Excite@Home may, upon fifteen (15) days prior notice to Application         Provider, request reasonable revisions to the Co-Branded Application as         needed to reflect changes that will not adversely affect Application         Provider, such as changes to Excite@Home's name and/or brand or changes         to the URLs for the links to the Excite Network. Application Provider         will use reasonable efforts to accommodate Excite@Home's requested         changes within the fifteen (15) day period.

  h)   Excite@Home will have editorial control over all email or other           similar communication with Excite@Home Members. Correspondence solely           regarding the Co-Branded Application will only be presented to Program           Members; communication with all other Excite@Home Members will be tied           to regular Excite@Home email schedules, which may or may not be           integrated with other email content at Excite@Home's sole option.           Correspondence specific to the Co-Branded Application may be mailed on           a schedule independent of other Excite@Home member mailings for those           Qualified Program Members that specify a frequency of contact. Until           an individual General Program Member specifies a frequency of email           contact, he or she will by default receive email pursuant to the           Co-branded Application's every-other-week email option setting. Any           mailings to such General Program Members who have not specified a           frequency of email contact will be mailed on a schedule that           coordinates contact with other Excite@Home newsletter and promotional           contacts, but at least with the frequency of every-other-week.           Communications with Excite@Home Members shall further be subject to           the requirements of EXHIBIT D.

       previously submitted a General Program Member User Data record, the           record shall be accounted for as follows:

       (1)  If the Qualified Program Member User Data record is supplied in                the same quarter in which the General Program Member User Data                record was originally supplied to e-centives, the Program Member                record shall be treated as always having been a Qualified Program                Member record for purposes of both volume and payments.

       (2)  If the Qualified Program Member User Data record is supplied in a                quarter different from the one in which the General Program                Member User Data record was originally supplied to e-centives,                the Program Member record shall be treated as a Qualified Program                Member record for purposes of both volume and payments, but a                credit shall be applied against the General Program Member volume                and payment guarantees.

       (3)  Payments shall be based upon the total number of records                delivered for each Program Member category. For payment purposes,                Excite@Home shall be obligated to track only total records per                category and shall not be obligated to track individual records.

d)   Payment Schedule

  i)   Within ten (10) days of the Effective Date of this Agreement,           e-centives shall make a non-refundable payment to Excite@Home of           $***** as pre-payment for Payment-Eligible User Data records:

In the event that the Launch Date is delayed beyond           March 31, 2000, the April 1, 2000, payment pursuant to this subsection           shall be postponed and shall instead be made within (10) days of the           Launch Date. Payments under this subsection shall be calculated as           follows:

            (2)  Qualified Program Member User Data: $*****, plus $*****

       iii) The amounts paid pursuant to subsection 7.d.ii shall be further                subject to the following cap: at no point shall e-centives' total                payments exceed an average of $***** per quarter. In the                event that the payment amount dictated by the formulas in                subsections 7.d.ii.(1) and (2) would raise e-centives' total                payments to an average in excess of $***** per quarter,                e-centives shall instead pay only that amount necessary to                maintain an average quarterly payment of $*****.

       iv)  A sample hypothetical payment schedule showing the effect of this                provision is included solely for purposes of illustration in                EXHIBIT G.

This provision           shall apply to net revenue generated during the year following the           end of the calendar quarter in which the names were supplied,           irrespective of the Term of this Agreement.

  shall provide such notice at least twenty-four (24) hours before the public      announcement of any such transaction.

vi)  The parties acknowledge that, due to the continually evolving nature of the      Internet, substantive changes to the product plan and integration      contemplated in the Agreement will likely be necessary during the Term.      From time to time, Excite@Home may require that Application Provider      provide extensions, incremental services and/or integration of the      Co-Branded Application (collectively, "Modifications"). In the event that      Application Provider is unable and/or unwilling to deliver such additions,      or in the event that the parties disagree on the direction of the      Co-Branded Application or its integration, Excite@Home may terminate the      Agreement with no penalty by providing ninety (90) days written notice.      Notwithstanding the foregoing, Excite shall not be entitled to terminate      this Agreement in the event that the requested

       Modifications exceed or are outside the scope of technology and/or           service levels generally available on the Internet.

b)   Effects of Termination

  i)   Each Party will promptly return all Confidential Information of the           other party.

  ii)  Each Party will pay all earned and undisputed outstanding amounts owed           to the other Party under this Agreement within thirty (30) days after           the effective date of such termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing,           all payments for User Data records shall be due and accrue in           accordance with terms of this Agreement.

  iii) For a period of up to sixty (60) days, Application Provider will           provide consulting services to Excite@Home, as Excite@Home may           reasonably request and for reasonable fees to be paid to Application           Provider, such fees to be agreed upon in writing by the Parties, to           assist Excite@Home in providing a seamless transition to Program           Members. Application Provider will have no obligation to provide such           services to Excite@Home to the extent that Application Provider's           personnel and resources are unavailable in the amounts requested by           Excite@Home or if the Parties are unable in good faith to agree on the           reasonable fees to be paid to Application Provider for such services.           Application Provider will not be required, in the course of providing           such consulting services to Excite@Home, to disclose or transfer to           Excite@Home any proprietary information, software, or Intellectual           Property of Application Provider or any of its merchant partners.

  iv)  To further ensure a seamless transition for Program Members, in the           event of a termination based upon a material breach by e-centives or           an acquisition pursuant to Section 16.a.v. only, Application Provider           shall continue to host and maintain the Co-Branded Application for a           period of one hundred twenty (120) days following either receipt or           issuance of notice of intention to terminate this Agreement. Such           hosting and maintenance of the Co-Branded Application shall be           provided by Application Provider at such reasonable rates as are           mutually agreed upon by the parties.

  v)   The provisions of this Section (Termination), Section 17           (Post-Termination Communications), Section 18 (Confidentiality),           Section 19 (Warranties and Indemnities), Section 20 (Limitation of           Liability), and Section 21 (Dispute Resolution) shall survive any           termination or expiration of this Agreement.    19 *****Confidential Treatment has been requested for portions of this agreement.

17.  POST-TERMINATION COMMUNICATIONS

  a)   Upon termination of this Agreement for reasons other than a           relationship with an Excite@Home Named Competitor under Section           16.a.v., the parties will communicate with Program Members as follows:

       i)   Excite@Home will email Program Members on e-centives' behalf up                to a maximum of two times. Consistent with other communications                envisioned during the Term of the Agreement, such mailings will                be branded Excite@Home but will alert Program Members that this                Agreement is to be terminated, the Co-Branded Application will

Source: INVENDA CORP, S-1/A, 8/28/2000





            continue with e-centives branding, and Program Members will                continue as a participant in the e-centives service unless they                explicitly opt out.  The content and copy of such emails shall be                mutually agreed upon.

       ii)  The first email will be exclusive to e-centives (i.e., it will                not mention similar services from Excite@Home or other third                parties) and will alert Program Members of the continuation of                the e-centives service directly from e-centives. Program Members                shall be further alerted that their membership in the e-centives                service shall continue unless they explicitly opt-out.                Excite@Home shall not promote competing services in such contact                or otherwise discourage Program Members from continuing to use                the e-centives service as provided directly by e-centives.

       iii) The second email will not be exclusive to e-centives. It will                include the same e-centives alerts as in the first email, but may                offer a replacement Excite@Home service and a notification that                the Program Member will remain in such an Excite@Home-provided                service unless they specifically opt-out. Excite@Home shall not                discourage Program Members from continuing to use the e-centives                service directly from e-centives, but may offer an additional                choice. It is conceivable that any one end user customer could                use both services.

       iv)  Any such communications will be subject to Excite@Home's                then-current privacy policy.

  b)   In the event that the Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section           16.a.v. due to e-centives' acquisition by an Excite@Home Named           Competitor, or by an entity controlling or controlled by an           Excite@Home Named Competitor, e-centives or its assigns or designates           may not contact any Users for whom User Data has been provided           pursuant to this Agreement, excluding those that have opted out in           accordance with Section 5(a) of Exhibit D. In the event of such           termination, e-centives will not be eligible for any refund of           pre-termination payments made to Excite@Home.

            Application Provider in any way, and such obligation, liability,                prejudice or impact can reasonably be expected to be material,                then such settlement shall require Application Provider's written                consent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), and                Application Provider may have its own counsel in attendance at                all proceedings and substantive negotiations relating to such                claim at Application Provider's sole cost and expense.

  c)   Except as specified in this Section, neither party makes any warranty           in connection with the subject matter of this Agreement and hereby           disclaims any and all implied warranties, including all implied           warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose           regarding such subject matter.

20.  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

  Except as provided by Sections 19(a)(iii)(2), (a)(iii)(3), (b)(iii)(2) and      (b)(iii)(3):

  a)   Neither party will have liability for any damages other than direct           damages. In no event will either party be liable to the other for any           special, incidental or consequential damages, whether based on breach           of contract, tort (including negligence) or otherwise, whether or not           that party has been advised of the possibility of such damage.

21.  DISPUTE RESOLUTION

  a)   The parties agree that any breach of either of the parties'           obligations regarding trademarks, service marks or trade names and/or           confidentiality would result in irreparable injury for which there is           no adequate remedy at law. Therefore, in the event of any breach or           threatened breach of a party's obligations regarding trademarks,           service marks or trade names or confidentiality, the aggrieved party           will be entitled to seek equitable relief in addition to its other           available legal remedies in a court of competent jurisdiction.

In the event           that the dispute(s) cannot be resolved through good faith negotiation,           the parties will refer the

     dispute(s) to a mutually acceptable mediator for hearing in the county         in which Excite@Home has its principal place of business.

  c) In the event that disputes between the parties arising from or         concerning in any manner the subject matter of this Agreement, other         than disputes arising from or concerning trademarks, service marks or         trade names and/or confidentiality, cannot be resolved through good         faith negotiation and mediation, the parties will refer the dispute(s)         to the American Arbitration Association for resolution through binding         arbitration by a single arbitrator pursuant to the American Arbitration         Association's rules applicable to commercial disputes. The arbitration         will be held in the county in which Excite@Home has its principal place         of business.

Any attempt         to assign this Agreement other than as permitted above will be null and         void.

  manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the inspected party's      business activities. In the case of underpayments, the inspected party      shall immediately make any overdue payments disclosed by the audit plus      applicable interest. Such inspection shall be at the inspecting party's      expense; however, if the audit reveals overdue payments in excess of 5% of      the payments owed to date, the inspected party shall immediately pay the

  cost of such audit, and the inspecting party may conduct another audit      during the same 12 month period. In the case of inaccurate and/or outdated      User Data, the providing party shall immediately provide accurate User Data      and/or updated User Data (to the extent such party has updated User Data.

f)   Force Majeure.  Any delay in or failure of performance by either party      under this Agreement will not be considered a breach of this Agreement and      will be excused to the extent caused by any occurrence beyond the      reasonable control of such party including, but not limited to, acts of      God, power outages and governmental restrictions.

h)   Entire Agreement.  This Agreement is the complete and exclusive agreement      between the parties with respect to the subject matter or related matters      hereof, superseding any prior agreements and communications (both written      and oral) regarding such subject matter.

i)   Waiver.  The failure of either Party to require performance by the other      Party of any provision of this Agreement will not affect the full right to      require such performance at any time thereafter; nor will the waiver by      either Party of a breach of any provision of this Agreement be taken or      held to be a waiver of the provision itself.

j)   Modification.  This Agreement may only be modified by a written document      executed by both parties.

k)   Construction.  The section headings appearing in this Agreement are      inserted only as a matter of convenience and in no way define, limit,      construe, or describe the scope or extent of such section or in any way      affect this Agreement.

                  CONTENT DESCRIPTION AND SPECIFICATIONS                             ("APPLICATION CONTENT")

The following describes the general product plan for the Co-Branded Application:

1.   CUSTOMER OFFERS

Source: INVENDA CORP, S-1/A, 8/28/2000





  a)   There shall be four distinct types of offers:

       i)   Traditional e-centives offers, which are classified as Targeted                Offers;

       ii)  Excite@Home-exclusive e-centives offers, which are classified as                Targeted Offers;

       iii) Other Excite@Home Member exclusive offers, which are classified                as Untargeted Offers;

            (1)  May be unrelated to e-centives and will have redemption off                     the e-centives-hosted experience.

       iv)  As deemed appropriate by Excite@Home, other offers that may or                may not be exclusive to Excite@Home which are provided as a feed                to e-centives, which are classified as Untargeted Offers;

            (1)  Required so that Members perceive e-centives-hosted content                     as a superset of Excite@Home's traditional content;

            (2)  Important not to have a binary selection -- non-Excite@Home-                     Member-exclusive offers in one area and Excite@Home-Member-                     exclusive offers in another -- an unacceptable user                     experience.

       v)   Design cues will be used to differentiate the different types of                offers seen by Members, as shown below:

                                  Anonymous Users     Excite@Home Members                                                     Served by                              e-centives          e-centives Traditional e-centives offers          Yes*                Yes Excite-exclusive e-centives offers     Yes*                Yes

                                                                                 Other Excite@Home Member offers      No         Yes

                  Non-Excite@Home-Member offers        Yes        Yes

                     * Must convert to Excite@Home Member status to redeem

  b)   e-centives will use commercially reasonable efforts to support up to           a combined 10,000 initial offers from Section 1.a.iii and 1.a.iv of           this Exhibit B on the Effective Date of this Agreement. Excite@Home           shall have the right to specify an increased capacity of offer           presentment at its sole option upon giving three months' advance           notice to e-centives at any point during the Term of this Agreement,           presuming such request shall be reasonable.

4.   OFFER PLACEMENT

  To ensure an opportunity for both parties to have a reasonable chance to      display their own offers within the Co-Branded Application, the following      prioritization of offers shall be made within any content area served by      e-centives:

  a)   For the first page presented within any shopping category area,

       i)   All Targeted Offers shall have placement priority above any                Untargeted Offers.

       ii)  Within the Targeted Offers region, the top 30% of the offer                placement locations on the first page within a category of the                Co-Branded Application (not including banner or sponsorship                placements) will be allocated to Excite@Home exclusive                e-centives offers. The remaining 70% of such first pages, along                with subsequent pages within each category, the offer placement                locations will be split 50%/50% between Excite@Home and

Source: INVENDA CORP, S-1/A, 8/28/2000





            e-centives and will be served in an alternating order.

       iii) Similarly, within the Untargeted Offers region, the top 30% of                the offer placement locations on the first page within a                category of the Co-Branded Application (not including banner or                sponsorship placements) will be allocated to Excite@Home. The                remaining 70% of such first pages, along with subsequent pages                within each category, the offer placement locations will be                split 50%/50% between Excite@Home and e-centives and will be                served in an alternating order.

  b)   For the second and any following pages presented within any shopping           category area, half of the offer placement positions will be           allocated to Excite@Home and the other half will be allocated to           e-centives and the position of said placements on the page shall be           random.

5.   CUSTOMER BRANDING EXPERIENCE

  a)   Until offer selection is made, branding shall be, at Excite@Home's           option, "Excite" or "Excite@Home" with a tag line "powered by           e-centives."

  b)   When offer management or redemption occurs, "Excite (or alternately,           Excite@Home, as detailed in Section 3.a of this Exhibit) powered by           e-centives" shall be replaced by cobranding, including full logo           treatment for e-centives. For any branding at the merchant subject to           final merchant approval, e-centives shall use commercially reasonable           efforts to ensure that both Excite@Home and e-centives branding           elements are present.

  c)   Both traditional e-centives offers and Excite@Home e-centives offers           will contain e-centives branding elements within an application that           is otherwise Excite@Home branded.

  d)   The Co-Branded Application shall conform to Excite@Home Third-Party           Application standards, including:

       i)   Page weight;

       ii)  Presence of advertising banners and/or sponsorship placements                served by Excite@Home/MatchLogic at Excite@Home's exclusive                option;

       iii) Color, fonts, layout, design standards, header, footer,                navigational elements, tabbing metaphors, etc.;

       iv)  Navigational elements directing traffic to non-e-centives content                (e.g., Excite@Home Mail and other Excite@Home Shopping                destinations);

       v)   Excite@Home's Third-Party Application Standards may change over                the Term of this Agreement. As they do, e-centives may be                required to make periodic design enhancements to comply with                these Standards. Any such required changes shall be reasonable                and shall be materially similar to changes required of other                applications and application providers subject to Excite@Home's                Third-Party Application Standards.

  e)   The Co-Branded Application shall be designed to appear to the customer           as being Excite@Home; analogs to the goal would be Excite@Home's           sports content area at http://www.excite.com/sports, as it appears on           the Effective Date of this Agreement (see Exhibit C), which is served           by a third-party firm but carries only Excite@Home messaging cues.

  f)   Other Excite@Home Member Offers, and Non-Excite@Home-Member Offers,           as highlighted in the matrix in Section 1.b of this Exhibit B, may           also require third-party branding in their presentation.

6.   OFFER HIERARCHY SYNCHRONIZATION

  a)   e-centives does not need to adopt Excite@Home's directory structure           but must use similar categorization methodology. For example, Autos           and Electronics may be categories at the same level in the hierarchy,           but Autos and Cameras would not be at the same level.

  b)   e-centives must map to Excite@Home's Shopping directory hierarchy,           which may change from time to time during the Term of this Agreement.

  c)   e-centives must adopt Excite@Home's naming conventions (e.g.           Excite@Home's "Autos" label vs. e-centives' "Automotive" label).

  d)   e-centives must provide product and/or offer search capabilities that           are comparable to Excite Network offerings, including local (zip           code) and off-line redemption. Any such required capabilities shall           be reasonable and shall be materially similar to capabilities           required of other applications and application providers subject to           Excite@Home's Third-Party Application Standards.

7.   PLACEMENT

  a)   During the first year of the Agreement a persistent "Above-the-Fold"           link shall remain present in the Excite@Home Shopping content area,           or its subsequent replacement, or an equivalent area as determined by           Excite@Home, that directs end users to the Co-Branded Application,           the phrasing of which shall be mutually agreed upon. "Above-the-Fold"           shall mean in a position generally viewable by an end-user customer           using an Internet browser which has been maximized to full screen on           a computer displaying a minimum resolution of 600 x 800 dpi or higher.

  b)   During the remainder of the Agreement, a prominent and persistent           link shall remain present in the Excite@Home Shopping content area,           or its subsequent replacement, or an equivalent area as determined by           Excite@Home, that directs end users to the Co-Branded Application.           The phrasing of the link shall be mutually agreed upon by the parties.

  b)   Excite@Home shall sell e-centives Thematic or Supplemental emails at           no less than e-centives' then current standard or generally available           discounted email rates. If Excite@Home does not sell such emails, or           all positions within such emails, then e-centives may do so.

  c)   Excite@Home and e-centives shall share equally all net revenue from           such offers, defined as gross revenue minus third-party serving           costs, which shall not exceed $0.01 per email piece delivered.

4.   RECIPROCAL DATA TRANSFER & REPORTING

  a)   The parties will allocate the production and sending of emails between           them based upon technical considerations to be addressed to both           party's mutual satisfaction.

  b)   The determination of which emails shall be sent by which party shall           be mutually determined.

Each party           shall assume its own costs in both sending outbound email and in           providing necessary reporting and data to the other party.

5.   COMMUNICATIONS TO PROGRAM MEMBERS WHO OPT OUT OF FIRST-PARTY CONTACT

  a)   Excite@Home maintains records concerning whether Excite@Home Users           have opted in or opted out of receiving contacts from Excite@Home           ("first-party contacts").

This notice shall be provided on a           schedule and in a format to be mutually agreed upon.

  c)   Within forty-eight (48) hours of receiving notice that a Program           Member has opted out of first-party contact, Application Provider           shall:

All decisions regarding this module remain Excite@Home's,         including but not limited to the name and relative placement of the         module on MESP. This module may not remain as a default module on the         page over the entire length of the Agreement.

 d)  No e-centives branding of any kind will be present on MESP.

2.  OFFER CATEGORIES

 a)  This Section applies to the publicly accessible narrowband offering from         Excite@Home, currently available at http://www.excite.com.

 b)  Excite@Home intends to use a randomization function to surface offers on         MESP in order to provide category specification by user and to support         dynamic content delivery for each server-refreshed page view. This         technique will support all e-centives categories and personalized user         category filtering, but will not support offers that can appear in         multiple categories or offer weighting.

 c)  Of all e-centives implementation links on MESP, any single category can         have only one link placement.

 d)  For a category to be surfaced, there must be three unique offers in that         category. The minimum of three offers per category must remain fresh;         if more than one week has elapsed without new offers being available         then a status message indicating no new offers in the category selected         will appear.

 e)  To prevent multiple appearances of a single offer on one MESP page view,         every offer must be tagged to only one e-centives category.

3.   USER TYPES

  a)   Anonymous Users and Excite@Home Members with no personalization of the           My Services module:

       i)   Excite@Home may display two to five links at its sole option. All                e-centives categories will be supported, but each category may                have at most one link.

  b)   Excite@Home Members with personalization of the My Services module           and/or provision of an e-centives account:

       i)   Excite@Home may display two to five links at its sole option. All                e-centives categories will be supported, but each category may                have at most one link per page view.

       ii)  Category surfacing will be based upon users' submitted                preferences.

       iii) Excite@Home Members shall retain unilateral control to turn all                offer presentments off.

4.   IMPLEMENTATION

  a)   e-centives shall write the necessary application for Excite@Home           provided API to automate bulk update of available offers into           Excite@Home's Concorde system. The targeted completion date shall be           12-16 weeks from the Effective Date of this Agreement.

  b)   The placement of e-centives promotional links on the default front           page will be implemented in a test mode for a pre-determined period of           time. Specific success measures, including increases in the conversion           rate of non-Excite@Home-Members to Excite@Home-Members, must be met           prior to making the decision to continue default placement.

  c)   Access to the e-centives organizer will be from links within Member           Services and Shopping and potentially other locations as well, at           Excite@Home's sole discretion.
