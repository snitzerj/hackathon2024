  14.4 Liquidated Damages on Termination.   14.4.1 Calculation of Liquidated Damages. You acknowledge and agree that the premature termination of this Agreement will cause substantial damage to us. You agree that Liquidated Damages are not a penalty, but represent a reasonable estimate of the minimum just and fair compensation for the damages we will suffer as the result of your failure to operate the Hotel for the Term.

You may not rely on this exception to your indemnity obligation if the claims were asserted against us or any other Indemnified Party on the basis of theories of imputed or secondary liability, such as vicarious liability, agency, or apparent agency, or our failure to compel you to comply with the provisions of this Agreement, including compliance with Standards, Laws or other requirements.   15.3 You will give us written notice of any action, suit, proceeding, claim, demand, inquiry or investigation involving an Indemnified Party within five (5) days of your knowledge of it.

This will not diminish your obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Parties and to hold them harmless. You will reimburse the Indemnified Parties on demand for all expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, expert fees, costs and other expenses of litigation, the Indemnified Parties incur to protect themselves or to remedy your defaults. The Indemnified Parties will not be required to seek recovery from third parties or otherwise mitigate their losses to maintain a claim against you, and their failure to do so will not reduce the amounts recoverable from you by the Indemnified Parties.   15.6 Your obligations under this Section 15 will survive expiration or termination of this Agreement.   16.0 RELATIONSHIP OF THE PARTIES   16.1 No Agency Relationship.
