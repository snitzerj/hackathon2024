Such orders shall state unit quantities, unit descriptions, requested delivery dates, and shipping instructions. No purchase order shall be binding upon JRVS until accepted by JRVS in writing.

Except as provided herein, all Orders for Products are non-cancelable, and Products are non-returnable (NC/NR). Subject to JRVS's written approval, orders for mining rigs may be rescheduled or cancelled subject to the cancellation fees, which are based on the number of days in advance of the scheduled shipment date that the Distributor notifies JRVS of cancellation and shall be set by JRVS from time to time. The Nonstandard Products are at all times non-cancelable. Distributor shall contact JRVS in advance for pricing and delivery information for orders of Non-standard Products. 5.1 JRVS Price.
