Inktomi shall provide Exodus with a copy of the Security Measures applicable under this Agreement and will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that Exodus strictly adheres to all such Security Measures.

          3.3  Subject to Microsoft's rights under Section 2.6.2 above and/or the Security Agreement between Inktomi and Microsoft of even date herewith, executed in accordance with the Loan Agreement, Microsoft shall not have any access to the Hosting Servers, except as follows: (i) Microsoft will have electronic read-only access to "real time" system data on the status of the usage, accessibility and performance of the Microsoft Search Engine (via software developed by Inktomi in consultation with Microsoft), and (ii) Microsoft will have the right, upon reasonable notice and during normal business hours, to have representatives escorted by Inktomi employees tour the premises where the Hosting Servers are located as necessary to ensure Microsoft's satisfaction with the operation of the physical plant and equipment.

Agreement the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.

          12.4   In the event any provision of this Agreement is rendered null, void or otherwise ineffective, then (i) the parties agree to negotiate in good faith an acceptable alternative provision which reflects as closely as possible the intent of the unenforceable provision and (ii) notwithstanding, and regardless of whether the parties reach agreement after the good faith negotiations described in clause (i) immediately above, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby and shall remain in full force and effect.

                            PRO-RATION METHODOLOGY

ALLOCATION OF EXODUS OPERATING COSTS

Exodus charges a monthly fee for facility space, fire suppression, air     conditioning, security, electricity, support services and Internet    connectivity. Inktomi is obliged to contract for this capacity in advance.    The connectivity is currently itemized and charged at a current rate of    [*].

[*] will be according to the [*] provisioned.

Example: [*] - [*] per day, [*] per day [*]. [*] of Exodus charges, [*] of    Exodus charges [*].

                          OVER-UTILIZATION ADJUSTMENT

In the event that one party under-provisions its portion of the shared Inktomi hosting cluster such that its [*] are [*] by the [*], there will be a charge on a [*] levied against the under-provisioned party.

If [*] for a [*] exceeds its agreed capacity provisioning (as determined in accordance with Sections 2.2 and 2.8, then Microsoft's [*] will be [*] ([*] if the [*] is by [*], or [*] if such [*] is by [*]) in accordance with the following computation: [*] the [*] ("[*]") times the [*] of the provisioned capacity ("[*]"). Note that the over-utilization could apply to [*] in any [*].

[*] will be calculated each month by taking the [*] of the Inktomi [*] without regard to [*] ([*]) [*] ([*]) [*] by the agreed total [*] provisioned.

[*] will be calculated for each party each month by [*] the number of [*] ([*] the [*] in the [*]) from the number of [*] for the [*].





Example:

     Assumptions:      1. Microsoft provisioned capacity is [*]      2. Inktomi provisioned capacity is [*]      3. [*] in [*] is $[*]      4. [*] is [*] for a [*]      5. [*] is [*] for that [*]

     [*] = $[*] = $[*]

     [*] = [*]  = [*]

     Over-Utilization Adjustment = [*] = $[*]              [*] in such [*] payable by [*]

Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, if a party shall have [*] its provisioned capacity by [*] in any month, such party shall be deemed [*] for its [*] during such month as soon as possible.

                                     EXHIBIT F                                    ---------

                              Transfer by Inktomi                               -------------------

If Inktomi requests Microsoft's consent to a transfer as described in clause (a) of Section 12.5 of this Software Hosting Agreement to which this Exhibit F is  appended, and Microsoft reasonably withholds its consent to such transfer (an  "Unconsented Transfer"), then Inktomi will nevertheless have the right to  transfer this Agreement in connection with its proposed Unconsented Transfer  subject to the following conditions precedent to the Unconsented Transfer:

(i)   Inktomi, at its sole cost and expense, and without any financing supplied by Microsoft, will create a separate cluster of Hosting Servers for Microsoft required to service Microsoft's reasonably anticipated needs for a period of twelve months after the commencement of operation of such new and relocated cluster [provided however that Microsoft will purchase, or fund (in accordance with the Loan Agreement) Inktomi's of, (whichever Microsoft elects) any new hosting servers beyond the Hosting Servers purchased by Inktomi under said Software Hosting Agreement necessary to service Microsoft's reasonably anticipated needs as set forth above];

(ii)  Inktomi will relocate, at its sole cost and expense (including, without  limitation, indemnifying Microsoft and holding it harmless against any and all  Taxes that arise as a direct or indirect result of the relocation of the Hosting Servers), all Hosting Servers referred to in clause (i) to a location designated by Microsoft, in its sole discretion;

(iii) Inktomi, at its sole cost and expense, will provide training to Microsoft  personnel to the extent requested by Microsoft, to enable such personnel to use  and maintain the Microsoft Search Engine, and to create enhancements thereto,  with reasonable competence (all as determined by Microsoft in its sole discretion);

(iv)  Inktomi will grant to Microsoft an irrevocable, non-exclusive,  royalty-free license to use the Product (and all required underlying Inktomi  Technology) solely in connection with Microsoft's operation of the Microsoft  Search Engine (which license shall include the right to create enhancements and  other derivative works based thereon for use in conjunction therewith) for such  period as Microsoft may require to transition its search engine services to  non-Inktomi technology (the "Transition Period"), and Inktomi will waive all  royalties otherwise payable pursuant to the Software Development Agreement  and/or the Information Services Agreement between the parties of even date  herewith; for the purposes of this clause (iv), the Transition Period will  commence at such time as Microsoft assumes control over said separate cluster  and begins itself operating the Microsoft Search Engine, and will continue  thereafter for eighteen months (18) or until the

                                      24

  termination of the Software Development Agreement and Information Services  Agreement (whichever is longer);

(v)   Inktomi will direct the Escrow Agent to release to Microsoft all Confidential Materials held by the Escrow Agent, subject to Microsoft's agreement to use such Confidential Materials only in connection with its licensed rights under clause (iv) above;

(vi)  Inktomi will agree to reimburse Microsoft for all reasonable costs incurred by Microsoft in transitioning its search engine to non-Inktomi technology (whether created by Microsoft or by a third party); and

(vii) Inktomi will cause the applicable proposed transferee of this Agreement to assume, jointly and severally with Inktomi, all of Inktomi's obligations  hereunder.

Microsoft will cooperate with Inktomi and use its reasonable best efforts so as





to enable Inktomi to satisfy the foregoing conditions precedent in a timely  manner. Upon satisfaction of the foregoing conditions precedent, this Software  Hosting Agreement shall be deemed terminated pursuant to Section 10.1. Upon  expiration of the Transition Period, all rights granted to Microsoft to use the  Product (other than Microsoft Technology, Joint Derivative Technology and the  Microsoft Derivative Technology) and/or any Inktomi Technology under the  transitional license referred to in clause (iv) or otherwise shall cease, and  Microsoft shall immediately return to Inktomi all Confidential Materials (and all copies thereof), provided however that, notwithstanding any provision of the Ancillary Agreements to the contrary, the undertaking by Inktomi to indemnify Microsoft and hold it harmless against Taxes as provided in clause (ii) above shall survive any such terminations.
