      This Agreement, entered into this the 10th day of January 2000, by and between INTEGRITY INCORPORATED, a Delaware corporation with principal offices at 1000 Cody Road, Mobile, Alabama ("Integrity") and TIME LIFE, INC., a Delaware corporation d/b/a Time Life Music, with principal offices located at 2000 Duke Street, Alexandria, Virginia 22314 ("TL"). The parties wish to produce a series of recorded compilations and companion song books featuring praise and worship repertoires, which will be co-branded and co-marketed throughout the world. Now, therefore, the parties agree as follows:

1.       Product Concept and Creation.

      a.       Product description. The product to be created under the                   series trade name "Songs 4 Worship" will be a praise and                   worship continuity series, with each volume in the series                   containing approximately 22 songs. Each volume will be                   manufactured in Double CD, Double Cassette, and song book                   formats, with standard double jewel boxes, inlays, booklets                   and j-cards (the "Product"). TL and Integrity will jointly                   develop the repertoire, and all repertoire selections are                   subject to master, mechanical and print rights clearance in                   accordance with the financial terms established below. The                   exact songbook format, song selection and number of songbook                   volumes has not yet been determined, and TL has no obligation                   to sell any songbooks produced pursuant to this Agreement.

      b.       Branding. The Product will prominently display the "Songs 4                   Worship" logo and trademark (or other logo as mutually                   approved) and will also bear the labels of "Time Life Music"                   and "Integrity Music" in equal proportion on the exterior of                   Product packaging. The "Integrity Music" and "Time Life Music"                   logos will be used on advertising whenever possible, and it is                   understood that neither logo will be used without the other                   with reference to the Product.

      c.       Integrity's responsibilities. Integrity will obtain master                   lease and print agreements with all third party owners of                   masters embodied in the Product at its own expense. Mechanical                   rates will not exceed [**]/1/ percent ([**]/1/%) of the                   then-current statutory rate, and Print licenses will not                   exceed a prorated portion of [**]/1/ percent ([**]/1/%) of the                   retail selling price, Integrity will also manufacture the                   Product and sell to TL its requirements for resale.

9.       Warranties; Suspension, Termination

      a.       Each party hereto warrants, represents, covenants and agrees                   that it has the right and power to enter into this Agreement,                   to grant the rights herein granted by it, and to perform the                   services agreed to be performed by it hereunder, and that no                   materials, ideas or other properties furnished or designated                   by it is subject to any restriction whatsoever, or is                   violative of the rights of any person, firm or corporation,                   including, without limitation, contract rights, copyrights and                   rights of privacy.

      b.       If, because of an act of God, inevitable accident, fire,                   lockout, strike or other labor dispute, riot or civil                   commotion, act of public enemy, enactment, rule, order or act                   of any government or governmental instrumentality (whether                   federal, state, local or foreign), failure of technical                   facilities, failure or delay of transportation facilities,                   illness or incapacity of any performer or producer, or other                   cause of a similar or

               different nature not reasonably within either party's control,                   such party is materially hampered in the recording,                   manufacture, distribution or sale of phonograph records, or                   its normal business operations become commercially                   impractical, then without limiting its rights, it will have                   the option upon notice to suspend the Term of this Agreement                   for the duration of any such contingency. In the event of a                   suspension owing to a "force majeure," which suspension                   exceeds six (6) consecutive months, the non-suspending party                   may terminate this Agreement upon ten (10) days written notice                   to other, but only if such "force majeure" does not affect a                   substantial portion of the United States recording industry or                   the suspension is not lifted by the suspending party within                   ten (10) days of the receipt of the written notice from the                   other party.

10.      Indemnification. Each party hereto agrees to indemnify the other party          and save and hold the other harmless from any and all claims, causes of          action, damages, liabilities, costs, losses, and expenses (including          legal costs and attorneys' fees) arising out of or connected with any          claim, demand or action which is inconsistent with any of the          warranties, representations, covenants or agreements which the          indemnifying party has made in this Agreement. Pending the          determination and settlement of any such claim, demand or action, the          non-indemnifying party will have the right, at its election, to          withhold payment to you of any monies otherwise payable hereunder, in          an amount reasonably related to that claim, demand or action, and its          estimated costs and expenses (including legal costs and attorneys'          fees) in connection therewith.

11.      Notices. The respective addresses for each party for all purposes          hereunder are set forth on page 1 hereof, unless and until notice of a          different address is received by the party being notified of a change          of address. All notices will be in writing and will either be served by          personal delivery (to an officer of each company), by mail or by          telegraph, in each case with all charges prepaid. Notices will be          deemed effective when personally delivered, mailed certified mail or          similar delivery requiring a signature upon delivery, all charges          prepaid, except for notice of change of address, which will be          effective only when received by the party notified. A copy of each          notice to Integrity will be simultaneously sent to Business & Legal          Affairs, Integrity Incorporated, 1000 Cody Road, Mobile, AL 36695, and          a copy of each notice to TL will be simultaneously sent to Law and          Business Affairs, Time Life Music, 2000 Duke Street, Alexandria, VA          22314. The failure to send courtesy copies of notices will not be          deemed a breach of this Agreement nor will it diminish the          effectiveness of such notice.

12.      Assignment. Either party may, at its election, assign this Agreement or          any of its rights or delegate any of its obligations hereunder, in          whole or in part, to any person, firm or corporation owning or          acquiring all or a substantial portion of its assets, to any person,          firm or corporation that is related to it as an affiliate,

      subsidiary or otherwise, or to any person, firm or corporation into          which or with it might merge or consolidate. In the event of such an

      assignment by either party of its rights to an unrelated third party,          the other party shall be given written notice, then in such event the          other party may upon six-months (6-months) written notice terminate          this Agreement.

13.      Miscellaneous

      a.       This Agreement contains the entire understanding of the                   parties hereto relating to the subject matter hereof and                   cannot be changed or terminated except by an instrument signed                   by the party to be bound. A waiver by either party of any term                   or condition of this Agreement in any instance will not be                   deemed or construed as a waiver of such term or condition for                   the future, or of any subsequent breach thereof. All remedies,                   rights, undertakings, obligations, and agreements contained in                   this Agreement will be cumulative and none of them will be in                   limitation of any other remedy, right, undertaking, obligation                   or agreement of either party. The headings of the paragraphs                   hereof are for convenience only and will not be deemed to                   limit or in any way affect the scope, meaning or intent of                   this Agreement or any portion thereof.

      b.       This Agreement has been entered into in the State of                   Tennessee, and the validity, interpretation and legal effect                   of this Agreement will be governed by the laws of the State of                   Tennessee applicable to contracts entered into and performed                   entirely within the State of Tennessee. The venue for any                   controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this                   Agreement or breach thereof, shall be the appropriate state                   and federal courts located in Nashville, Tennessee.                   Accordingly, each party hereto consents and submits to the                   jurisdiction of such courts. The prevailing party in any such                   dispute arising hereunder will be entitled to recover from the                   other party its reasonable attorneys' fees in connection                   therewith in addition to the costs thereof.

      c.       If any part of this Agreement will be determined to be invalid                   or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction or by                   any other legally constituted body having jurisdiction to make                   such determination, the remainder of this Agreement will                   remain in full force and effect.

      d.       EACH PARTY HAS BEEN REPRESENTED BY INDEPENDENT LEGAL COUNSEL                   OR HAS HAD THE UNRESTRICTED OPPORTUNITY TO BE REPRESENTED BY                   INDEPENDENT LEGAL COUNSEL OF ITS CHOICE FOR PURPOSES OF                   ADVISING IT IN CONNECTION WITH THE NEGOTIATION AND EXECUTION                   OF THIS AGREEMENT.

               REPRESENTED BY INDEPENDENT LEGAL COUNSEL OF ITS CHOICE IN                   CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, SUCH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND                   AGREES THAT ITS FAILURE TO BE REPRESENTED BY INDEPENDENT LEGAL                   COUNSEL IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT WAS DETERMINED                   SOLELY BY IT.
