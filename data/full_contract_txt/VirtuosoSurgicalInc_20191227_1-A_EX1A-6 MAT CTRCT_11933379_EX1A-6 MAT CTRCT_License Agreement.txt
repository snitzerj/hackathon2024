Company shall allow at least seven (7) business days notice of any proposed public disclosure for JHU's review and comment or to provide written consent. 9.5 Duties of the Parties: JHU is not a commercial organization. It is an institute of research and education. Therefore, JHU has no ability to evaluate the commercial potential of any PATENT RIGHT(S), LICENSED PRODUCT(S), LICENSED SERVICE(S) or other license or rights granted in this Agreement.

The obligation of the Company to defend and indemnify as set out in this Paragraph 9.7 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and shall not be limited by any other limitation of liability elsewhere in the Agreement. 9.8 Product Liability: Prior to first commercial sale of any LICENSED PRODUCT(S) or LICENSED SERVICE(S) as the case may be in any particular country, Company shall establish and maintain, in each country in which Company shall sell LICENSED PRODUCT(S) or LICENSED SERVICE(S), product liability or other appropriate insurance coverage appropriate to the risks involved in marketing LICENSED PRODUCT(S) and/or LICENSED SERVICE(S) and will annually present evidence to JHU that such coverage is being maintained. Upon JHU's request, Company will furnish JHU with a Certificate of Insurance of each product liability insurance policy obtained. JHU shall be listed as an additional insured in Company's said insurance policies. If such Product Liability insurance is underwritten on a 'claims made' basis, Company agrees that any change in underwriters during the term of this Agreement will require the purchase of 'prior acts' coverage to ensure that coverage will be continuous throughout the term of this Agreement. 9.9 Entire Agreement: This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding between the parties with respect to the obligations of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes and replaces all prior agreements, understandings, writings, and discussions between the parties relating to said subject matter.
