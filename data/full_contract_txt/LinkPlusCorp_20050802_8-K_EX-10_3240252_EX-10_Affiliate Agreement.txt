         This Agreement entered into as of the Effective Date by and between Link Plus Corporation and Axiometric, LLC.

                                    RECITALS

         WHEREAS, Axiometric has developed certain computer software including wireless mesh networking technology and AMR devices and systems;

         WHEREAS, LKPL has developed certain radio devices and systems along with hardware manufacturing capacities and plans to develop AMR devices and systems;

         WHEREAS, LKPL and Axiometric believe it will be in their mutual best interests to cooperate in further developing AMR product suites by creating a preferred provider relationship between themselves;

         WHEREAS, LKPL and Axiometric entered into a Letter of Intent dated May 3, 2005, and now desire to further describe their relationship as initially set forth in the non-binding portions of that Letter of Intent.

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises contained herein, the fees to be paid in connection therewith, and other good and valuable consideration, the sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows:

1.       DEFINITIONS

         1.1      Throughout this Agreement, and unless the context otherwise                   requires, the terms shown on Exhibit A (whether or not                   capitalized) shall have the meanings there specified. If other                   terms are defined in the text of this Agreement, then                   throughout this Agreement, those terms shall have the meanings                   respectively ascribed to them.

2.       OFFICE SPACE

         2.1      During the term of this Agreement, LKPL will provide                   Axiometric with a license to use office space in LKPL's                   corporate facility in Columbia, Maryland, free of charge.

         2.2      LKPL will allow Axiometric to use enough office space for two                   individuals and associated equipment in locations convenient                   for LKPL's purposes for as long as that space is available and                   not needed by LKPL for its own purposes. Axiometric will have                   access to LKPL's telephone system, internet connections,                   conference room, and printers.

         2.3      If LKPL requires space used by Axiometric for LKPL's own                   purposes, then LKPL will attempt in good faith but without                   having any obligation to continue to provide Axiometric with                   comparable space. If LKPL deems itself unable to continue to                   provide Axiometric work space without expanding LKPL's                   facilities, and if LKPL determines it will be in its own best                   interests to expand its facilities, then LKPL will afford                   Axiometric the opportunity to lease space in the new                   facilities under a mutually acceptable separate commercial                   rental agreement. If Axiometric does not then wish to rent                   office space from LKPL, then LKPL may terminate Axiometric's                   license to use work space in LKPL's facility upon 60 days                   notice.

         2.4      Axiometric shall be solely responsible for providing all                   equipment, furniture, supplies and other personal property                   that Axiometric deems appropriate to operate its business.                   LKPL will have no obligation to provide any special facilities                   or infrastructure unless otherwise negotiated.

         2.5      LKPL will have no liability whatsoever for any of Axiometric's                   equipment, furniture, supplies or other personal property;                   Axiometric will use the space at its sole risk.

         2.6      Axiometric will have the right to terminate the license to use                   the office space and to move out of the office space at any                   time upon two weeks notice.

         2.7      Axiometric must at all times use the office space strictly in                   accordance with terms and conditions stated in LKPL's lease                   for the space.

         2.8      Axiometric must indemnify and hold LKPL and its officers,                   directors, stockholders, agents, contractors, employees and                   guests (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") harmless from                   and against any and all Loss that the Indemnified Parties may                   incur arising from or relating to Axiometric use of the office                   space, including but not limited to any Loss suffered by the                   Indemnified Parties as a result of any negligent acts or                   omissions of Axiometric, its employees, agents, contractors                   and representatives, or anyone else working under Axiometric                   or in the office with the permission of Axiometric.

3.       AUTOMATIC METER READING

         Axiometric and LKPL agree to jointly pursue accessing and commercially          penetrating the AMR market by developing a suite of qualified and          commercially marketable product suites for that market, marketing and          selling that suite of products. The following shall be the general          roles and responsibilities of the two companies with respect to AMR          efforts:

         3.1      AMR Products

                  3.1.1    Water Meter Development: Axiometric and LKPL are                            jointly developing an AMR product for remote reading                            of residential water utility meters (hereafter the                            Water Meter). The Water Meter is a hardware device                            with integral software. The software includes, under                            license, the Axiometric wireless mesh networking                            intellectual property. The Water Meter is capable of                            interfacing with a variety of water meter registers,                            recording water usage, logging various exceptional                            conditions, and reporting them via a radio link. The                            Water Meter is also capable of forming a mesh network                            with other Water Meters to extend the radio reporting                            range using the aforementioned Axiometric mesh                            networking intellectual property. The Water Meter                            software and hardware are based on existing                            Axiometric electric meter AMR hardware and software                            products; joint ownership of the Water Meter does not                            convey joint ownership of those existing products or                            of the mesh networking intellectual property.

                           New software and hardware designs and intellectual                            property developed in the course of the Water Meter                            development are jointly owned; specifically, the                            algorithms used to collect data directly from a Water                            Meter using a point-to-point link (drive-by data                            collection), the specific hardware designs related to                            water register interface, battery power management,                            and other intellectual property specifically

                           described and mutually agreed in writing as                            amendments to this Agreement. Joint ownership conveys                            to each party individually the right to use, sell,                            modify, and create derived works from said                            intellectual property, as well as the right to                            sub-license these rights to others.

                  3.1.2    Energy AMR Product Suite: Axiometric has developed an                            AMR product suite for use in energy (electric)                            metering consisting of a meter insert for interfacing                            to energy meters, recording usage and exceptional                            conditions, and transmitting the information via                            radio to a central collector. Axiometric has also                            developed mesh networking intellectual property to                            allow the meter inserts to relay information from                            insert to insert thus extending the range and                            reliability of such information transmissions.                            Axiometric has also developed a central collection                            unit (hereafter Mesh Controller or Gateway) capable                            of collecting usage and other information from a                            large number of meter inserts and relaying that                            information onto another communications medium                            (radio, GSM, etc.) for delivery to a processing                            system. Axiometric has also developed processing                            software for recording the collected data to a                            database, presenting

                           and managing that information, and exporting the data                            to other processing systems.  This collection of                            products forms an energy metering (electric) AMR                            Product Suite that is owned by Axiometric.

                  3.1.3    Axiometric and LKPL may develop other AMR Product                            Suites (e.g. for gas metering) and ownership of those                            AMR Product Suites will be held individually by the                            developer of the suite or jointly if mutually agreed                            to in writing.

         3.2      Marketing and Sales: Regardless of ownership and in order to                   coordinate marketing and prevent overlap and confusion by                   customers and potential customers, all sales and marketing                   shall be conducted as follows:

                  3.2.1    Axiometric shall have the exclusive right to market                            and sell AMR Product Suites to entities whose                            corporate headquarters are physically located in the                            United States and U.S. territories with the exception                            of Datamatic as defined in 3.3.1 and 3.3.2 below

In the event a Payee's audit shows that the                                     Gross Proceeds or Production Costs of the                                     Payor resulted in an under-payment to the                                     Payee, then the Payor shall have the right,                                     at the Payor's cost, to have its own auditor                                     verify the Payee's audit. If the Payor audit                                     confirms the report of the Payee's auditor,                                     then the Payor will pay the deficiency                                     within fifteen (15) days from the time Payee                                     invoices for the deficiency.

If the Payor audit confirms the                                     report of the Payee's auditor, then the                                     Payor will pay the deficiency and the cost                                     of the Payee's audit within fifteen (15)                                     days from the time Payee invoices for those                                     fees and provides standard proof of the time                                     and expenses incurred.
