         (c)      Subject to Licensee's applicable security requirements,                   provide XACCT with access to and use of all information and





                  system facilities including but not limited to a modem                   connection to Licensee's systems determined necessary by XACCT                   to provide timely Support Services pursuant to this Agreement;

         (d)      Follow operating instructions and procedures as specified in,                   but not limited to, XACCT's documentation and other                   correspondence related to the Product;

XACCT may in its sole                   discretion charge additional fees for time and materials for                   the resolution of problems that are not attributable to an                   error in the Product or which are excluded from XACCT's                   support obligations as set forth below.

3.5      XACCT shall have no obligation to support:

         (a)      altered, damaged or Licensee-modified Product, or any portion                   of the Product incorporated with or into other software other                   than as contemplated by XACCT's documentation or as otherwise                   expressly approved by XACCT in writing;

         (b)      any version of the Product other than the current version of                   the Product, the immediately previous version and the version                   preceding the immediately previous version; XACCT's obligation                   to support the version prior to the immediately previous                   version shall not extend beyond six (6) months after the                   release of the current Major Release of the Product;

         (d)      Product installed on any hardware, operating system version or                   network environment that is not supported by XACCT; or

         (e)      Incidents if XACCT makes a good faith determination that the                   primary cause of the problem results from the failure or                   malfunction of any system, equipment, facilities or devices                   not furnished by XACCT.

3.6      Any obligation for Support for non-standard versions of the Product or          portions thereof developed for Licensee on a customized basis shall be          only as set forth in an amendment or other supplement to this          Agreement.
