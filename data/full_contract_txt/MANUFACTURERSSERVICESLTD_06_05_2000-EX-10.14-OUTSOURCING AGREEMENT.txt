Page 6                                  Dated 05/05/98

                                IBM Confidential

      b)    upon the occurrence of any of the following:

            i)    the other Party resolves to go into voluntary liquidation;

            ii)   a court orders the other Party to cease doing business;

            iii)  a receiver or administrative receiver is appointed over the                   whole or any part of the assets or property of the other                   Party;

            v)    substantially all of the shares or assets of one Party are                   acquired by an entity that competes directly with the other                   Party.

      a)    IBM may perform process audits at MSL's or an MSL Related Company's             Work Center or MSL's subcontractors' facilities to assure that             identified IBM specifications have been complied with. IBM shall             advise MSL [*] Days in advance of the scope and method by which             such audits are to be conducted. MSL will be given the opportunity             to comment upon these procedures prior to the audit taking place.             For all identified IBM specifications, MSL will maintain and             produce for IBM process documentation for use in all audits             performed by IBM and will have current copies of said documentation             available prior to the start of an audit.

      b)    Upon completion of all audits performed, IBM will provide written             documentation to MSL of the audit results in the form of an audit             report. MSL will be required to respond in writing to IBM on the             completion status of all actions and or requirements identified in             the audit report within [*] Days of receipt of the audit report.

Within [*] days of the Effective Date, IBM shall give the tangible             assets listed in Attachment 3: Asset List, Part 1B to MSL. On the             Effective Date, MSL shall purchase

                                IBM Confidential

            the assets listed in Attachment 3: Asset List, Part 2 for the amount             stated on the bill of sale for such assets and pay for such assets             in full by or before December 1, 1998 (the "Payment Date").

      b)    The Parties acknowledge that the assets listed in Attachment 3:             Asset List, are a pro forma listing only and that within 10 (ten)             days of the Effective Date, both parties agree to perform a physical             audit of these assets listed and in IBM's possession as of the             Effective date to ascertain that the assets located during that             physical audit are verified. Within 20 (twenty) days after the             Effective Date, IBM will prepare a listing of the assets in             Attachment 3: Asset List, Part 1B to verify IBM's net book value of             the assets plus [*] for each non-capitalized printer. This listing             shall contain the price for each asset listed separately. MSL shall             notify IBM within 30 (thirty) days of the Effective Date if it does             not wish to receive all of the available tangible assets in             Attachment 3: Asset List, Part 1B by notifying IBM in writing of the             types of equipment it does not wish to receive. IBM shall choose             which equipment MSL will receive based on MSL's chosen equipment             type. The startup and investment expense defined in Attachment 4,             Section 3, shall be reduced by IBM's net book value of the assets in             Part 1B for the equipment accepted by MSL plus [*] U.S. dollars             [*] for each non-capitalized printer. In any event, the physical             audit for all assets shall result in a new listing for the assets             contemplated hereunder which listing shall be substituted for the             Attachment 3: Asset List that is attached to this Agreement at the             Effective Date. The amount stated on the bill of sale of the assets             listed in Part 2 shall reflect the results of a physical audit and             obsolescence review. Such adjustments shall be subject to the             mutual agreement of the Parties.

      c)    If by the Payment Date, MSL fails to pay IBM in full for the assets             listed in Attachment 3: Asset List, Part 2 at the price specified in             b) above, IBM may offset the balance owed by MSL as provided in             Section 6.2(a) above, and without MSL's further consent, until IBM             has recovered such balance.

      d)    MSL acknowledges that IBM has not made any representations or             warranties with respect to the assets listed in Attachment 3: Asset             List, except those expressly set forth in this Agreement, including,             but not limited to the representation and warranty of title. All             assets delivered to MSL pursuant to this section shall be provided             on an 'AS IS' basis. NO OTHER WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESSED OR             IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF             MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR THE WARRANTY OF             NON-INFRINGMENT ARE PROVIDED HEREUNDER.

      e)    In the event of termination or expiration of this Agreement             pursuant to Section 5.0 above, IBM shall have an option, which             shall expire [*] days after such termination or expiration, to             purchase from MSL, at a reasonable price agreeable to the Parties,             all assets used by MSL to perform the manufacturing and fulfillment             functions

      f)    Assets purchased by MSL and listed in Attachment 3: Asset List, Part             2 are to be used solely in Products purchased by IBM pursuant to the             Attachment 1: Statement of Work.

SECTION 9.0 PERSONNEL

      a)    Attachment 2 contains a list of the individuals employed by IBM at             the date hereof in connection with this Agreement, including active             employees and employees who are on leave of absence or sick leave             (herein the "Employees").

      b)    MSL will make an unconditional employment offer to the Employees,             listed in Attachment 2, to be effective on the Effective Date of             this Agreement. The Employees who accept employment offers from             MSL and who have begun their employment with MSL ("Transferred             Employees") will be employed by MSL in accordance with the terms set             forth below. IBM will terminate all Employees, listed in Attachment             2, at the Effective Date of this Agreement and IBM will be             responsible for any and all employment related liabilities up to the             Effective Date, including, but not limited to, vacation and sick             time, workers compensation claims, variable compensation, and             severance.

      c)    MSL agrees that all Transferred Employees will be continuously             employed by MSL for at least [*] after the Effective Date, except as             otherwise provided herein, and will receive a total compensation             package as identified in Attachment 2: Employee list and Benefits             Information. Furthermore, with respect to the Transferred Employees,             MSL shall grant, to the extent granted by IBM, credit for service             with IBM prior to the Effective Date for purposes of participation             and eligibility to participate under MSL's employee benefit plans             and other policies and programs of MSL.

      d)    Nothing in this Agreement shall operate in any way to limit or             prevent MSL from terminating any Transferred Employee at any time             for reasons of cause related to poor job performance or conditions             of employment.

      e)    If MSL suffers a substantially adverse change in its business,             related to a reduction in IBM's Products requirements, including             reductions of Products requirements due to migration to a             competitive supplier, for the [*] from the Effective Date of this             Agreement, MSL may terminate such number of Transferred Employees             as it deems necessary. However, IBM shall only reimburse MSL for             termination benefits paid to such Transferred Employees, which are             substantially similar to IBM's then severance package, and             provided that all MSL subcontractors and other MSL non management             employees assigned to the US Work Center have been terminated             prior to or along with the termination of the Transferred             Employees.

      f)    IBM agrees that, for a period of [*] years from the Effective Date             of this Agreement, it will not in any way solicit for employment             any Transferred Employees without the prior written consent of MSL;             provided, however, that the foregoing will not restrict or prevent             IBM from a) employing any such person who contacts IBM on his or her             own initiative without any solicitation or encouragement from IBM             or b) by using general employment advertising or communications or             independent search firms, hiring any person who responds thereto,             provided that IBM does not direct or encourage such independent             search firms to solicit such Transferred Employees.

      a)    IBM shall not receive confidential information from MSL under this             Agreement. However, if it becomes necessary for IBM to give certain             confidential information to MSL, it will be done so pursuant to the             Agreement for Exchange of Confidential Information ("AECI") Number             4998S60076.

      b)    All information considered confidential by IBM will be marked             confidential by IBM prior to the exchange. If the confidential             information is to be disclosed orally, IBM will promptly provide MSL             with a written summary following the disclosure. In the event, the             information is not marked confidential, it shall not be deemed             confidential.

      c)    Each time IBM wishes to disclose specific information to MSL, IBM             will issue a supplement to the above referenced AECI. All requests             to disclose confidential information must be approved by the             Relationship Managers. During the term of this Agreement and upon             the request of IBM, MSL shall return all confidential information             immediately.

      d)    Neither Party shall disclose the terms of this Agreement to any             third Party, including debt or financing institutions, without the             prior written consent of the other Party, which consent shall not be             unreasonably withheld or delayed, except as required by law.

      e)    Neither Party shall make any public announcements regarding this             Agreement or matters pertaining hereto, other than as may be             expressly agreed upon in advance by the Parties in writing.

All such licenses and permits held by IBM             which are material to the operation of the assets are valid and in             full force and effect and there are not pending or, to the knowledge             of IBM, threatened in a writing to IBM, any proceedings which could             result in the termination or impairment of any such license or             permit which termination or impairment would materially interfere             with the operation or use of the assets as

            ii)   If MSL is unable or unwilling to [*] the [*] because IBM's [*]                   for the Product has been below the minimum [*] parameter for                   the prior [*] months, MSL shall have a grace period [*] months                   from written notice of the [*] to make adjustments it deems                   necessary to [*] the [*]. This grace period is contingent upon                   MSL making, within [*] Days of notice of the [*], a commitment                   to [*] the [*] at the end of the grace period.

      d)    In the event, IBM Latin America or IBM Asian Pacific were to receive             an [*] from a [*] that contains an ongoing [*], which is more [*]             than MSL's [*] and which is subject to comparable terms and             conditions and for substantially similar [*], to provide [*]             services for the Product(s), IBM will notify MSL.  MSL shall have             [*] Days after written notice of such [*] to [*] or [*] such [*].             MSL shall have a grace period of [*] months from written notice of

         a)       If [*] and/or elemental [*] are reduced by MSL or lower [*]                   are [*] by MSL to other [*] for a [*] that is similar to [*]                   under similar terms and conditions, including without                   limitation [*], MSL will reduce the [*], or reduce the [*] to                   IBM to the [*] as those [*] to other [*]. The [*] and [*] will                   apply to all [*] IBM [*] and to all [*] Product deliveries                   during the term of this Agreement.

         b)       If IBM or MSL negotiate or schedule a [*] for [*], the                   corresponding [*] will be effective when MSL begins using and                   shipping the [*].

         c)       A negotiated [*] could result if there is a significant                   increase or decrease in the Product [*] from those assumed                   for [*] definition. If this occurs, the parties shall                   negotiate in good faith an appropriate adjustment to MSL's                   [*]. The revised [*] will apply to all [*] which have been                   [*] but not [*] and to all [*] releases during the term of                   this Agreement.

         d)       A [*] increase or decrease may result if IBM makes an [*] to a                   Product. Any [*] change will be per the terms of [*] and the                   [*] of the changed Product will carry the same inherent [*]                   as the original Product.

         e)       Proposals for updates to the initial [*] will be reviewed each                   [*] on a [*] day cycle. The schedule will be as follows:

                  "T" shall be the date that MSL [*] and IBM [*] are ready for                   table load; it is the last day of a calendar [*] end [*].

                  [*] Days before T, MSL shall initiate an update proposal.

                  [*] Days before T, MSL shall answer all IBM questions and                   issues and revise its proposal.

                  MSL [*] to be used will be the [*] costs used for [*] in the                   previous quarter.

         g)       Any differences between [*] costs, as defined in Section 7.1,                   assumptions used in determining [*] at the beginning of a [*]                   and actual [*] by MSL during the [*] will be determined and                   agreed in the first month of the following [*]. NIC will be                   applied to [*] costs differences at the [*] defined in                   Appendix 1 to this SOW. No other components of [*] will be                   applied to [*] costs differences. Differences will be                   invoiced separately to MSL or to IBM as the case may be.

SECTION 8.0 PURCHASE OF PARTS BY MSL

8.1   IBM Parts, IBM Strategic Parts, and IBM Designated Parts

      MSL will purchase IBM Parts, IBM Strategic Parts, and IBM Designated Parts       solely for use in IBM Products. MSL will provide IBM Strategic Parts and       IBM Designated Parts as follows:

      a)    IBM procurement may sell IBM Strategic Parts to MSL by specifying             price, lead time and other terms with mutually agreed to ordering             processes such as;

            i)    MSL may order IBM Strategic Parts from IBM procurement through                   standard purchase orders, and/or

            ii)   MSL may issue periodic blanket purchase orders to IBM                   procurement for lineside stocking and pull logistics                   requirements for IBM Strategic Parts.

      b)    MSL may purchase IBM Designated Parts through IBM nominated             suppliers, as agreed to by IBM. IBM will disclose, as confidential             to MSL, terms and conditions contained in the subject IBM nominated             supplier/IBM contract, which IBM determines are relevant to MSL's             performance under the Agreement. MSL shall be responsible for all             liabilities to IBM nominated suppliers for IBM Designated Parts             ordered by MSL. If an IBM nominated supplier objects, MSL shall             immediately inform IBM. IBM agrees to provide reasonable assistance             to MSL in resolving the situation. If such IBM nominated supplier             refuses to [*] to MSL at IBM's [*], IBM cannot use [*] from such             supplier to determine MSL [*] described in Section 7.5 e) i) above,             and upon written notice to IBM, MSL will be entitled to increase             the [*] of the [*] to

              IBM/MSL Outsourcing Base Agreement Statement of Work

            reflect MSL's actual increase in IBM [*]. The corresponding [*]             increase will be effective when MSL begins using and shipping the             higher [*] IBM [*].

8.2   Parts Cost Reductions

      a)    In the event MSL can purchase the same parts as available through             IBM Procurement or IBM Designated Suppliers at lower costs, MSL will             identify those reduction opportunities to IBM on a monthly basis.

      b)    The Parties agree that [*]% of all Parts price reductions will be             [*] to IBM when MSL begins using and shipping the lower costs             Parts. However, if a specific price reduction is the direct result             of a previously IBM approved substantial engineering, design, or             resourcing change by MSL, that price reduction will be [*] for a             period of [*] months, then [*]% of the Parts price reduction will             be [*] to IBM.

SECTION 9.0 PREMIUM COST

      Premium costs may be incurred in order to meet Delivery Dates.

      a)    MSL may submit premium costs to IBM for reimbursement that are in             addition to prices defined in Sections 7.1, and 7.2. Premium costs             include materials, labor and other extraordinary items.

      b)    The Parties agree that [*] of all Parts price reductions will be [*]             to IBM when MSL begins using and shipping the lower costs Parts.             However, if a specific price reduction is the direct result of a             previously IBM approved substantial engineering, design, or             resourcing change by MSL, that price reduction will be [*] for a             period of [*] months, then [*] of the Parts price reduction will be             [*] to IBM.

      b)    If Requirements Accuracy, as defined in Appendix 2, exceeds [*]%             and if demand is beyond Supply Flexibility as defined in Section             13.2 and Appendix 4, premium costs resulting solely from unplanned





            demand shall be subject to reimbursement.

      c)    Total premium costs for any single event which are equal to or             exceed [*] must be pre-approved in writing by IBM prior to MSL             authorizing or expending the premium. Total premium costs for any             single event which are less than [*] may be incurred by MSL without             IBM authorization to later be negotiated with IBM in good faith.

      d)    MSL will use the following process for requesting authorization             and/or reimbursement of premium costs from IBM:

      e)    Premium Price

                  MSL shall have sole responsibility for setting the                   compensation rates for its staff. MSL staff shall in no way be                   deemed to be employees of IBM.

                  [*] rate is the rate at which [*] are charged to IBM (as                   required by IBM), and will be in accordance with the [*]                   basis. The [*] rate shall not exceed [*]([*]%) of [*] rate.                   The actual [*] will be negotiated on a case-by-case basis by                   IBM and MSL and will not exceed MSL's actual [*] paid to its                   [*] and [*]. MSL's request for authorization and/or                   reimbursement must state:

                  (a)    Purchase price variance due to [*] or [*].

                  (b)    Quantity of [*] by Product(s) part number.

                  (c)    Quantity of units to be shipped due to [*].

                  (d)    [*] Rate: US dollars/hour.

                  (e)    Justification for [*].

                  MSL agrees that it will invoice quoted Direct Labor Hours for                   actual Products Delivered.

            iii)  Extraordinary Items

                  MSL may propose premium rates for expedited tooling orders,                   premium transportation, and other extraordinary requirements.                   If IBM agrees that the resources are required, MSL and IBM                   will negotiate in good faith the price for such resources.

                  MSL will report all open premium costs, which are subject to                   request for reimbursement by IBM as a part of monthly                   Measurements.

SECTION 10.0 ORDER MANAGEMENT, DELIVERY, AND SHIPMENT





10.1  Order Management

      a)    IBM Customer Orders will be placed from IBM to MSL. MSL will fulfill             these orders according to the Performance Appendix 3 unless IBM             gives MSL specific written instruction otherwise. MSL will ship and             deliver these Products in accordance with the ship and delivery             dates stated on the order. In the case of Integration, shipments and             deliveries will be made in accordance to the customer roll out             schedules provided by IBM. MSL will conform to the stated lead times             agreed to and published by IBM to the Delivery Point as long as the             requested Delivery Date on the IBM Customer Order falls within MSL's             commitment to the forecast. Product lead times are published in the             Product Attachments.

      b)    MSL will manage the applicable IBM Customer Order back logs. These             include but are not limited to AAS, EOSE, GEMS, IPRs, Q-Ship, MES             and others as defined by IBM. In conjunction with these IBM ordering             channels MSL will perform Order Desk responsibilities. MSL will             review all orders requesting delivery improvements, improving these             order to satisfy the customer required delivery dates given supply             continuity and available capacity. At [*] to IBM, MSL will accept             [*]. Deferments will be requested of MSL through the IBM ordering             systems mentioned above, or in writing from IBM. MSL will             reschedule the deferred orders to meet the requested ship dates.             In addition MSL will accept request to alter order content if Parts             and capacity are available. MSL will respond to all request to             improve, defer and/or alter orders in [*] Days. MSL agrees to             maintain the above mentioned IBM Customer Order backlogs keeping             these back logs up to date. MSL agrees to maintain local Order             Desk support in the geography specific Work Center.

      c)    MSL agrees to perform materials requirement planning ("MRP") on top             level requirements input and acquire the appropriate Parts to             support Delivery Dates and IBM Customer Orders. This includes the             placing of purchase orders and/or IPRs on suppliers, some of which             may be IBM locations.

      d)    Due to the high commonality of Parts in IBM's Products, MSL will             allow IBM to revise Product model mix as required. MSL will             acknowledge IBM's Product mix changes within [*] Days after receipt             of IBM's change notice.

10.2  Schedule / On Time Delivery

      a)    MSL will maintain [*] ([*]%) on time shipment. Specifically             Product(s) are to arrive in full at the Delivery Points on the             Delivery Date.

      b)    MSL agrees to track and report on shipments/deliveries to IBM             customers per the IBM Customer Orders at the request of IBM.

10.3  Delivery

      a)    Title and risk of loss to Products shall pass to IBM at the time of             shipment from the Delivery Point unless otherwise stated in Section             15.0.

      b)    If Product shipments are made prior to the Delivery Date without             IBM's prior written approval, IBM may elect to delay passage of the             title until the Delivery Date. If the delivery is late then transfer             of Product title will be made on the later date. In addition MSL             will not deliver Products in quantities in excess of those set forth             in on the IBM Customer Order, without IBM's prior written approval.

10.4  Delays in Shipment

      MSL shall notify IBM immediately of any anticipated late deliveries and       any impending plant or facility shut downs for any reasons. If MSL fails       to ship Product to the Delivery Point on schedule for any reason other       than Force Majeure or delays caused substantially by IBM, MSL shall ship       Product to the Delivery Point by air or in the most expeditious manner       possible. After MSL delivers Product to the Delivery Point, MSL will ship       Product to the designation stated on the IBM Customer Order by air or in       the most expeditious manner possible. MSL will be responsible for any       additional premium costs associated with the late shipment of Product       not only to the [*] but also to the [*] stated on the IBM Customer       Order.

10.5  Shipment Terms





      a)    The prices set forth in Section 7.0 Product Price include MSL's out             of pocket costs for freight, duty, customs, clearance, and             appropriate insurance, and any other costs related to the shipment,             export, or import of the Products before delivery to IBM. The cost             are the responsibility of MSL. The method of transportation shall be             suitable surface or air transport to the Delivery Point, Customer             location, or point of entry sufficient to meet IBM's Delivery Date.             The Product Attachment(s) shall state the Delivery Points.

      b)    MSL shall arrange shipment with IBM carriers that will deliver             product to the destination on the IBM Customer Order in time for the             product to arrive on the committed arrival date which is stated on             the Customer Order. MSL shall utilize IBM carriers for all outbound             shipments, unless prior written approval from IBM to do otherwise.             IBM's approval will not be unreasonably withheld. Contractual             conflict with IBM carriers, or added IBM cost are some, but not all,             reasonable causes for denial of IBM approval.

SECTION 11.0 PRODUCT FORECAST

              IBM/MSL Outsourcing Base Agreement Statement of Work

11.2  Each month IBM will provide MSL, one rolling [*] month forecast by machine       type, model, and by geography. This forecast will be MSL's authorization       to order/purchase Parts only for the fulfillment of orders, in accordance       to the IBM published lead-times for such materials. Products shall be       produced and delivered according to actual intake of IBM Customer Orders.       MSL will participate in the process of requirements planning by giving the       best Product supply projection and participating in cross functional       meetings when required.

      The following will apply:

      a)    The forecast will contain anticipated Delivery Dates for specified             quantities of machine types, models and geographies and lead-time             profile updates, as required, for specific Parts.

      b)    MSL will notify IBM within [*] Days of receipt of a forecast if MSL             is unable to meet the quantities and Delivery Dates. If MSL fails to             notify IBM within the [*] Days, MSL will be deemed to have accepted             the quantities and Delivery Dates and will be bound by them;             provided, however, that MSL's actual or deemed acceptance of any             forecast shall be subject to the availability of IBM Parts and IBM             Designated Parts as needed, and MSL shall not be subject to any             penalties (and IBM shall not be able to reject any proposed             rescheduling of Delivery Dates) under this Agreement for failure to             meet Delivery Dates due to the unavailability of such Parts at the             times necessary to meet Delivery Dates, provided further however             that such unavailability of IBM Parts or IBM Designated Parts is not             due to MSL's failure to properly order such Parts or otherwise             properly manage its relationship with the provider of such Parts.

      c)    If MSL notifies IBM that it cannot meet the quantities and Delivery             Dates in IBM's forecast, MSL's notification will include the             quantities MSL can deliver within the forecast's Delivery Dates and             proposed schedule of Delivery Dates for delivering the quantities             MSL cannot deliver within the forecast. IBM shall notify MSL in             writing, within [*] Days of receipt of MSL's notification, of its             decision either, in its sole discretion to:

            i)    agree to the quantities and Delivery Dates in MSL's                   notification, which will then become binding upon both                   parties; or

            ii)   agree to the quantities that will meet the forecast's Delivery                   Dates, which will then become binding on both parties, and                   either begin good faith negotiations with MSL to resolve any                   shortfall or reject MSL's proposed schedule for the remaining                   quantities; or provided, however that IBM may not reject MSL's                   proposed schedules if the reason for MSL's inability to meet                   the Delivery Dates is directly attributable to a breach of                   this Agreement by IBM. MSL may, with IBM's prior written                   approval and at MSL's expense, employ another manufacturer for                   the quantities that MSL cannot deliver within the forecast for                   the affected products. Notwithstanding any other term of this                   Agreement, if IBM rejects all or any part of MSL's proposal,                   IBM shall also be free to seek

In addition, this evaluation should include, but is             not limited to, MSL's evaluation of the ECs effect on the inventory,             delivery schedules and impact effect on function, reliability and             performance of Products. If such evaluation cannot be completed             within such period, notice to this effect shall be given by MSL as             soon as MSL learns that such evaluation cannot be completed and in             no event later than the [*] Days following notification. MSL will             give IBM a future completion date and reason for delay in such             notice.

      c)    Upon completion of MSL's evaluation, IBM and MSL agree that 1) MSL             will implement the EC after MSL has received IBM's consent in             writing to the mutually agreed upon cost and delivery schedule, 2)             MSL will provide additional information that IBM may reasonably             require to further evaluate the EC, or 3) IBM will cancel the             specific EC.

      d)    ECs will be brought to the attention of MSL via Engineering Change             Notifications (ECNs), that may have various forms, and may come from             IBM or IBM designated parties. However, the ECN is not an             authorization to execute the change. Upon receipt of an ECN, MSL             will respond by quoting the cost of that EC to IBM. MSL will not             implement any EC without an explicit authorization from IBM to             implement it. The

14.9  Security

      a)    Sufficient security must be provided for work in process items,             customer and MSL/IBM provided. In addition, secured spaces will be             required from time to time for individual customers depending on the             nature of the work. Currently there is a contractual requirement for             secured space to perform the US Postal Service, hard drive, code             load program.

      b)    All reasonable precautions must be exercised to prevent unauthorized             access, use, modification, tampering or theft of software and             hardware consigned to MSL for the execution of Integration. Also,             these precautions must prevent unauthorized access to a customer's             remote system used in the performance of Integration.

14.10 Scheduling

      Product orders placed on MSL by IBM, in most cases, the CRAD (Customer       Required Arrival Date) will tie to the Integration roll out delivery date.       In those cases where there is a difference, MSL will validate the correct       delivery date with the IBM project manager. If an improvement or deferral       is required in the Product build schedule and based on Product       availability, MSL will schedule the Product build to insure arrival by the       required CRAD.

14.11 Delivery

      MSL will maintain [*] percent ([*]%) on time delivery, measured against       the CRAD date in the integration roll out schedule. Due to the nature of       the integration orders, there is no [*] option, unless agreed to prior to       shipment by the IBM project manager and/or the customer.

14.12 Customer Satisfaction

      Customer satisfaction is the responsibility of MSL. IBM will measure the       customer satisfaction via surveys. MSL commits to a customer satisfaction       target of [*]. This will be a reflection of MSLs on time deliveries,       flexibility in meeting the customers unplanned requirements, the quality       of the services performed and MSL's relationship, in general with IBM's       customers. The customer set will include the IBM Global Services project       managers and IBM's customers.

14.13 Integration Quality

      The service being performed is to be of high quality and free from process       defects. The target objective will be [*]%, measured monthly. MSL will be       responsible for the repair and/or replacement of Parts and Products which       have been damaged during the performance of the Integration. MSL will be       responsible for cost incurred by IBM as a direct result of MSL's failure       to follow the Integration procedures subject to the limitations contained       in Section 15.3 of the Base Agreement.

14.14 Price

      a)    IBM will establish a list of those items which are standard             components of the Integration process. IBM and MSL will agree upon             an execution time and a price, as stated in Section 7.2 b), for each             standard item. Integration requirements outside of these standard             items will be individually determined. Once these prices for these             standard items are established they will remain in effect during             the entire term of this Agreement.

      b)    MSL will be responsible to track items which are beyond the             individual Integration SOW being executed when performed at IBM's             request and provide sufficient documentation to support the price             along with IBM's authorization of the added cost. MSL will invoice             IBM weekly for these costs. In those cases when a specific request             becomes standard, or a change in effort is requested by a customer,             a revision to the Integration SOW will be made and the contracted             price between IBM and MSL will be updated.

      c)    MSL will be responsible for any cost beyond the agreed to [*] if             these costs were within the control of MSL.

14.15 Transportation

      a)    Premium outbound transportation may be used when requested by a             customer. In these cases, MSL must provide sufficient documentation             of the customer approval, and to support the cost.

      b)    If premium outbound transportation is necessary due to MSL's             failure to ship on time, this cost is the responsibility of MSL             and IBM will invoice MSL for these costs.

14.16 Integration SOW Completion

      At the completion of an individual Integration SOW, a complete       reconciliation will be completed within 60 Days. This reconciliation will       be between MSL and the IBM project manager/customer and will include, but       not limited to, an inventory reconciliation, any outstanding cost and       disposition of all customer software and hardware in MSL's possession.

14.17 Equipment

      IBM will identify the current equipment, owned by IBM, needed to perform       Integration and it will be made available to MSL at an agreed to price per       Attachment 3 of the Base Agreement. If, at any time, MSL chooses to       replace Integration support equipment and the associated programs, IBM's       written concurrence will be required.

14.18 Restrictions and Limitations

      Nothing in this Agreement authorizes MSL to use any of IBM's tangible,       real or intangible property for the performance of any services       contemplated hereunder on IBM Logo products or for Integration services of       non-IBM Logo products related to a customer for whom Integration is being       provided by IBM. In any event, MSL will ensure that the IBM customer       delivery schedules will not be impacted based on other performance       obligations it may have during the term of the Agreement.

14.19 Measurements/Reports

      a)    MSL will be required to provide IBM with monthly reports detailing             their performance in relation to these Integration.

SECTION 15.0 DROP SHIPMENTS

      MSL will complete processes required to meet the following obligations       within [*] Days following the Effective Date.

      a)    For Drop Shipments to IBM, MSL will be responsible for all             activities required to deliver the Products to the destination port             of the IBM company in the destination country. MSL will issue an IBM             invoice to the destination IBM company on behalf of the IBM business             area invoiced by MSL for these deliveries. MSL will ensure that             invoices and other required documentation are ready at the             destination port for timely importation into the country, but, MSL             will not be responsible for importation into the destination

If IBM so             chooses, IBM will notify MSL of its intent to accept nonconforming             items. MSL agrees to negotiate in good faith a price reduction for             such items based upon IBM's reasonable added expense to correct and             otherwise deal with such deficiencies. After the parties agree on a             price, IBM will notify MSL that IBM has accepted the nonconforming             items. No items for which IBM has issued a notice of nonconformance             shall be deemed accepted, except as provided in the first sentence             of this Section.

      b)    IBM's payments for Products shall not signify that IBM has accepted             Product.

      b)    MSL shall not purchase any tooling or other capital equipment on             IBM's account without IBM's prior written approval.

            i)    If specifically required in a Product Attachment, IBM will                   supply tooling for Products to MSL. It shall be IBM's option                   whether the tooling will be consigned by IBM to MSL or                   purchased by MSL.

            ii)   If IBM elects to have MSL purchase tooling, MSL shall be                   responsible for the design, cost and build of all new or                   replacement tooling which shall be capable of producing                   Product in accordance with the IBM specification in the                   Product Attachment. MSL warrants that the tooling used under                   this Agreement shall be capable of producing the quantity of                   Product as specified by IBM.

            iii)  If IBM elects to have MSL purchase the tooling, MSL shall                   invoice IBM for the cost of such tooling at such time as the                   tooling is placed into service. The cost of such tooling                   includes, but is not limited to, the cost of any purchased                   components (including parts and complete items), fully                   burdened MSL engineering and/or manufacturing labor use in the                   design and/or construction of such tools, duties, insurance,                   transportation, installation, costs and costs of

                  money, if any. MSL agrees that MSL engineering will be priced                   to IBM on a "most favored customer" basis.





            iv)   Both parties may agree to amortize the tooling and shall put                   such agreement in writing and any terms and conditions                   associated with such amortization. If IBM and MSL agree to                   amortize the tooling, IBM agrees to pay for the tooling and                   any associated carrying cost agreed to between the Parties via                   an amortization charge in addition to the respective Product                   price as defined in Section 7.0. The amortization period for                   each tool will be stated in the applicable Product Attachment                   and shall be triggered by the initial delivery of the                   Product(s) for which the tooling expenses are incurred.

                  IBM will state the estimated ship quantity and maximum monthly                   ship rate for the amortization period. MSL will define the                   total tooling cost to support the maximum ship rate. The total                   tooling cost will be divided by the estimated ship quantity                   provided by IBM. This unit amortization cost will be itemized                   in MSL's quotes as "tooling adder".

            v)    The tooling cost recovery, via the "tooling adder", will be                   analyzed during each quarterly review meeting between IBM and                   MSL. The intent is to adjust the "tooling adder" based upon                   volume changes, such that the total tooling cost will be                   recovered by the end of the amortization period. If at the end                   of the amortization period the tooling cost have been over or                   under recovered, an adjustment invoice will be processed                   accordingly.

      c)    MSL acknowledges and agrees that its utilization of any tooling for             other customers will not impact IBM's product requirements. MSL will             obtain IBM's written approval prior to entering into a contract with             a third party involving tooling for Products listed in the Product             Attachment.

      d)    In the event that MSL owns the tooling and has received a bona fide             third party offer to purchase any or all of the tooling, before MSL             may accept such offer, MSL shall notify IBM in writing, and IBM             shall have [*] Days after such notice to agree to purchase such             tooling on the same terms and conditions as such third party offer.

      e)    All tools, dies, jigs, patterns, equipment or Parts purchased,             furnished, charged to or paid for by IBM and any replacement thereof             shall become and remain the property of IBM. IBM agrees to provide             MSL appropriate technical support for IBM owned tooling at no charge             to MSL. IBM shall have the option of removing IBM owned tooling from             MSL directly, depending upon Product strategy and production.

21.2  Care

      MSL is responsible for protection, calibration, maintenance and care of       all tooling owned by IBM and shall be liable for loss or damage of such       tooling while in MSL's possession or control. IBM agrees to insure tooling       it owns. Where possible, MSL will be jointly insured with respect to the       IBM owned tooling for its interest. This tooling shall be subject to       inspection by IBM upon notice and shall be returned in an acceptable       condition, reasonable wear and tear excepted, upon demand or notice by       IBM. MSL will be responsible for

APPENDIX 2: REQUIREMENTS ACCURACY

The formula for measuring the accuracy of requirements placed on MSL for a given quarter accompanied with an explanation, is the following:

Requirements Accuracy % = [*]

Where [*] represents the performance [*] months prior to the last month of the quarter in which you are measuring the Requirements Accuracy. The Forecast represents the requirements that was passed by IBM [*] months prior, for the total volume by machine type for the quarter that is being measured. Actual Order Load represents the final amount of orders scheduled for the quarter being measured. For example when measuring the [*] for the first quarter in 1998 you would calculate [*] by taking the [*] that was passed [*] for the first [*] in [*] and subtract the actual [*] for that [*]. Then divide by the forcast and multiply by [*]. You follow the same methodology for [*] looking at the forecast [*] months prior to the last month of the quarter being measured. Once [*] through [*] is calculated you apply these results to the formula above.

                                       [*]





The formula measures the accuracy of requirements placed on MSL for a given quarter, each month, starting [*] months prior to the end of the quarter, using a [*] weighted calculation.

The following percentages will be multiplied by the material cost of the volume of the machine type shipped in the quarter that fell below [*]% of the Requirements Accuracy calculation.

            REQUIREMENTS ACCURACY          INCREMENTAL %             AS DEFINED ABOVE               APPLIED TO MATERIAL COST                                                         [*] and Greater                  [*]%                Less than [*]%                   [*]%

Payments for these liabilities will be made via a separate invoice.

               Agreement for Exchange of Confidential Information

IBM ============================================================================

      Our mutual objective under this Agreement is to provide appropriate       protection for Confidential Information (Information) while maintaining       our ability to conduct respective business activities. Each of us agree       that the following terms apply when one of us (Disclose) discloses       Information to the other (Recipient) under this Agreement.

SECTION 1 ASSOCIATED CONTRACT DOCUMENTS

      Each time one of the parties wishes to disclose specific Information to       the other, the Discloser will issue a Supplement to this Agreement       (Supplement) before disclosure.

      The Supplement will identify the Recipient's person designated to be its       Point of Contact for the disclosure and will contain the Initial and Final       Disclosure Dates. If either of these dates is omitted from the Supplement,       such date will be deemed to be the actual date of disclosure. Information       becomes subject to this Agreement on the Initial Disclosure Date. The       Supplement will also contain a non-confidential description of the       specific Information to be disclosed and any additional terms for that       Information.

      The only time Recipient and Discloser are required to sign the Supplement       is when it contains additional terms. When signatures are not required,       the Recipient indicates acceptance of Information under the terms of this       Agreement by participating in the disclosure, after receipt of the       Supplement.

SECTION 2 DISCLOSURE

      The Discloser and Recipient's Point of Contact will coordinate and control       the disclosure. Information will be disclosed either:

            1)    In writing;             2)    By delivery of items;             3)    By initiation of access to information, such as may be                   contained in a data base; or             4)    By oral and/or visual presentation.

      Information should be marked with a restrictive legend of the Discloser.       If Information is not marked with such legend or is disclosed orally:

            1)    The Information will be identified as confidential at the time                   of disclosure, and             2)    The Discloser will promptly provide the Recipient with written                   summary.

SECTION 3 OBLIGATION

      The Recipient agrees to:

            1)    use the same care and discretion to avoid disclosure,                   publication or dissemination of the Discloser's Information as                   it uses with its own similar Information that it does not wish                   to disclose, publish or disseminate; and             2)    use the Discloser's Information for the purpose for which it                   was disclosed or otherwise for the benefit of the Discloser.

      The Recipient may disclose Information to:

                                                                     Page 2 of 5

            1)    its employees and employees of its parent and subsidiary                   companies who have a need to know; and             2)    any other party with the Discloser's prior written consent.





      Before disclosure to any of the above parties, the Recipient will have a       written agreement with such party sufficient to require that party to       treat information in accordance with this Agreement.

      The Recipient may disclose Information to the extent required bylaw.       However, the Recipient must give the Discloser prompt notice to allow the       Discloser a reasonable opportunity to obtain a protective order.

SECTION 4 CONFIDENTIALITY PERIOD

      Information disclosed pursuant to this Agreement will be subject to the       terms of this Agreement for [*] years following the Final Disclosure Date.

IBM Equipment and Program Loan Agreement     ============================================================================

This is an Equipment and Program Loan Agreement ("EPLA") between International Business Machines Corporation (hereinafter called "IBM"), a New York corporation, with an address for the purpose of this Agreement at 8501 IBM Drive, Charlotte, NC 28262, and Manufacturers' Services Western US Operations, Inc. (hereinafter called "MSL"), with an address at 5600 Mowry School Road, Newark, CA 94560.

IBM and MSL agree that the following terms and conditions apply when IBM loans MSL equipment and programs including associated user manuals and similar documentation (Loaned Items). Loaned Items may also be referred to as Loaned Equipment or Loaned Programs, as applicable.

SECTION 1 ASSOCIATED CONTRACT DOCUMENTS

      Attachment 5 of the Outsourcing Agreement lists the Loaned Items. A       revised Attachment 5 sets forth any additions or deletions to the listed       Loaned Items. MSL's continued use of the Loaned Items or acceptance of       additional Loaned Items after its receipt of a revised Attachment 5 will       constitute its acceptance of such Attachment.

      The loan of Loaned Items is made in conjunction with the IBM and MSL       Outsourcing Agreement dated _____________________ ("Referenced       Agreement") for the purpose of MSL fulfilling its responsibilities and       obligation as stated in the Reference Agreement.

SECTION 2 TERM AND TERMINATION

      Unless otherwise mutually agreed, the EPLA will be in effect for as long       as the Referenced Agreement is effective.

SECTION 3 LOANED PERIOD

      IBM will provide the Loaned Items to MSL on or about the Effective Date of       the Referenced Agreement. The Loan Period for each Loaned Item will extend       from the actual date IBM delivers the Loaned Items(s) to MSL, until the





      earliest of:

      a)    the applicable return date specified in the Attachment or revised             return date specified in a revised Attachment;

      b)    the date MSL acquires i) title to the Loaned Equipment or ii) a             continuing license to the Loaned Program, should such acquisition or             licensing be available to MSL under Section 12: or

      c)    on the Referenced Agreement expiration date.

SECTION 4 AUTHORIZED USE

      IBM provides Loaned Items to MSL solely for use in accordance with the       terms of this Agreement and for the Purpose of the loan described either       in this Agreement or in the Referenced Agreement (Authorized Use). There       are no charges for Authorized Use of the Loaned Items. MSL may not use the       Loaned Items for any other purposes.

SECTION 5 OWNERSHIP AND LICENSE

      IBM or another party retains title to all Loaned Items. MSL may not       transfer Loaned Items to anyone else. For Loaned Programs which are not       subject to IBM's or another supplier's or publisher's license agreement,       IBM grants MSL a license to use, store, modify and make sufficient copies       to support MSL's Authorized Use under this Agreement. Such copies will be       deemed to be Loaned Items. For Loaned Programs which are subject to       another supplier's or publisher's license agreement, however, the terms       and conditions of that supplier or publisher are passed to MSL through       IBM. Such terms and conditions will be shipped with the Loaned Program.       For Loaned Programs which IBM licenses to others under an IBM license, the       terms of the applicable IBM license which are not inconsistent with this       Agreement apply. IBM will provide such terms to MSL upon request Any       authorized copies made by MSL will be deemed to be Loaned Items.

SECTION 6 LICENSED INTERNAL CODE

      If the Loaned Equipment contains Licensed Internal Code (Code), so       identified by IBM, IBM grants MSL a license only to execute such Code to       enable the Loaned Equipment to perform in accordance with IBM's official       published specifications. MSL may not reverse assemble, reverse compile,       decode, translate, or make any other copies of the Code. MSL must return       the original copy of the Code to IBM at the conclusion of the Loan Period.

SECTION 7 DELIVERY AND INSTALLATION

      IBM will deliver the Loaned Items to 8501 IBM Drive, Charlotte, NC 28262.

      MSL will:

            1)    set-up all Loaned Equipment, and

            2)    install all Loaned Programs

SECTION 8 RISK OF LOSS OR DAMAGE

      IBM relieves MSL of the risk of loss of, or damage to, all Loaned Items,       except for loss or damage resulting from MSL's breach of this Agreement       including use other than Authorized Use.

SECTION 9 SECURITY

      MSL will provide, at no cost to IBM, adequate security to protect the       Loaned Items from theft, damage or misuse.

      MSL will use reasonable care in the use of all Loaned Items. MSL will       provide an operating environment for the Loaned Items consistent with the       related user documentation.

      MSL will keep the Loaned Items at the Installation Address specified in       the Attachment. MSL will not move the Loaned Items to another location       without IBM's prior written approval.

SECTION 10 SERVICE AND SUPPORT

      During the time the Loaned Items are in MSL's possession, MSL shall, at       its own expense:

      a)    Develop and maintain the expertise to operate the Equipment             independent of IBM and ensure that the Equipment complies at all             times with all federal, state, and local governmental safety and             other requirement (including OSHA regulations). If MSL determines             that any of the Loaned Items received from IBM fails to comply with             any such requirements, MSL shall promptly notify IBM, and IBM shall

EPL00L(CLT-EPL 1.1-02/93)                                            Page 3 of 7

            either replace the Loaned Item or instruct MSL to modify the Loaned             Item so that it compiles, at IBM's expense.





      b)    Service the Loaned Items and maintain them in good operating             condition at all times.

      c)    Replace or repair all items lost, damaged or destroyed except to the             extent MSL proves to IBM that such loss, damage or destruction is             caused by circumstances beyond MSL's control. All replacement of             Loaned Items Shall become IBM property and shall be Subject to all             the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

      MSL will permit IBM personnel full, free and safe access to MSL's       facilities, during normal business hours, after reasonable notice, for the       purpose of inspection and inventory as IBM deems necessary.

SECTION 11 ALTERATIONS AND ATTACHMENTS

      MSL may make an alteration to Loaned Equipment (e.g., a change in the       structure of the equipment) only upon IBM's prior written approval. MSL       may make an attachment to Loaned Equipment (e.g., coupling a printer to a       loaned personal computer) without notice to IBM.

      MSL will remove any alteration or attachment and restore Loaned Equipment       to its unaltered condition before its return to IBM or upon IBM's notice       to MSL that the alteration or attachment creates a safety hazard or       renders maintenance of the Loaned Equipment impractical.

SECTION 12 DISPOSITION OF LOANED ITEMS

12.1  Return to IBM

      MSL will return the Loaned Equipment to IBM at the end of the Loan Period,       except as may be provided for in this Section. MSL will return the Loaned       Equipment to IBM in the same condition as when delivered to MSL,       reasonable wear and tear excepted.

      MSL will return the original and all copies of the Loaned Programs at the       end of the Loaned Period, except as may be provided in this Section.

      MSL will permit IBM personnel access during IBM's normal business hours to       allow IBM to remove the Loaned Items.

12.2  Acquisition and Continued Licensing

      IBM will determine the availability of Loaned Equipment for MSL's       acquisition and Loaned Programs for MSL's continued licensing beyond the       applicable Loan Period. MSL must inform IBM, prior to the end of the       applicable Loan Period, of MSL's interest in the acquisition of specific       Loaned Equipment or the continued licensing of specific Loaned Programs.       IBM will then notify MSL in writing either;

            1)    of the terms and conditions under which MSL may acquire such                   Loaned Equipment or continue to license such Loaned Programs,                   or

            2)    that the Loaned Items are not available for acquisition or                   continued licensing.

      Continued Licensing of Loaned Programs will be governed by the provisions       of the applicable IBM license agreement or another supplier's or       publisher's license agreement. IBM will identify to MSL the applicable       agreement which governs such licensing.

SECTION 13 DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY

      IBM PROVIDES LOANED ITEMS ON AN "AS IS" BASIS. IBM MAKES NO WARRANTY,       EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO SUCH ITEMS, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED       WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

SECTION 14 PATENTS AND COPYRIGHTS

      If the operation of a Loaned Item becomes, or IBM believes is likely to       become, the subject of a claim that it infringes a patent or copyright in       the United States or Puerto Rico, MSL will permit IBM, at its option and       expense, either to secure the right for MSL to continue using the Loaned       Item or to replace or modify it so that it becomes noninfringing. However,       if neither of the foregoing alternatives is available on terms which are       reasonable in IBM's judgment, MSL will return the Loaned Item upon IBM's       written request.

      IBM will have no obligation with respect to any such claim based upon       MSL's modification of IBM equipment, programs or programming or their       combination, operation or use with any non-IBM apparatus, data or       programs.

      IBM will not have any liability regarding patent or copyright infringement       for non-IBM Loaned Items.

      This Section states IBM's entire obligations to MSL regarding infringement       or the like.

SECTION 15 LIMITATION OF REMEDIES





      IBM's entire liability and MSL's exclusive remedy for actual damages from       cause whatsoever relating to the subject matter of this Agreement will be       limited to the amount of $25,000. This limitation will apply, except as       otherwise stated in this Section, regardless of the form of action,       whether in contract or in tort, including negligence. This limitation will       not apply to claims by MSL for bodily injury or damage to real property or       tangible personal property for which IBM is legally liable.

      In no event will IBM be liable for any lost profits, lost savings,       incidental damages, or other economic consequential damages, even if IBM       has been advised of the possibility of such damages. In addition, IBM will       not be liable for any damages claimed by IBM based on any third party       claim.

      In no event will IBM be liable for any damages caused by MSL's failure to       perform MSL's responsibilities.

SECTION 16 GENERAL

      MSL may not assign this Agreement without IBM's prior written consent. Any       attempted assignment without such consent is void.

      Loaned Items are to be installed only in the United States or Puerto Rico.

      IBM will pay destination charges, both from and to IBM-designated       locations, for each Loaned Item shipped in accordance with IBM's then       current shipping practice. MSL will pay any rigging charges. MSL will       furnish all labor for unpacking and packing except as IBM otherwise       specifies or when performed at an IBM-designated location.

      IBM may provide services described in this Agreement by using IBM-selected       independent contractors.

      Neither party is responsible for failure to fulfill its obligations under       this Agreement due to causes beyond its control.

      Neither party may bring an action, regardless of form, arising out of this       Agreement more than [*] years after the cause of action arose.

      In the event of termination or expiration of this Agreement, the       provisions of this Agreement which, by their nature, extend beyond the       expiration or termination of this Agreement shall remain in effect beyond       such expiration or termination until fulfilled.

      If there is a conflict between this Agreement and an Attachment, the terms       and conditions of the Attachment will prevail. Except as modified by an       Attachment the terms of this Agreement remain in full force and effect.       The terms of any Attachment not inconsistent with a subsequent Attachment       remain in full force and effect.
