Section 9.3    INDEMNIFICATION PROCEDURE.  Promptly after acquiring knowledge of any loss, action, suit, investigation, proceeding, demand, assessment, audit, judgment or claim against Licensor or Licensee, or as to which Licensor or Licensee may be liable, a party entitled hereunder to be indemnified shall give written notice thereof to the party obligated hereunder to provide indemnification.  The indemnifying party at its own expense promptly shall defend, contest or otherwise protect against any damage, loss, deficiency, liability, claim, encumbrance, penalty, cost, expense, action, suit, investigation, proceeding, demand, assessment, audit, judgment or claim made by a third party against which such indemnifying party has agreed to indemnify any indemnified party, and each indemnifying party shall receive from the indemnified party all necessary and reasonable cooperation in said defense, including without limitation the services of employees of the indemnified party who are familiar with the transactions out of which any such damage, loss, deficiency, liability, claim, encumbrance, penalty, cost, expense, action, suit, investigation, proceeding, demand, assessment, audit, judgment or claim may have arisen.  The indemnified party shall have the right to control the defense of any such third party proceeding unless it is relieved of its liability hereunder with respect to such defense by the indemnified party.  The indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall not be at the expense of the indemnifying party if the indemnifying party has assumed the defense of the action with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party; provided that the fees and expenses of the indemnified party's counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnifying party if (i) the employment of such counsel has been specifically authorized in writing by the indemnifying party or (ii) such indemnified party shall have been advised by counsel hat there is a conflict of interest or issue conflict involved in the representation by counsel employed by the indemnifying party in the defense of such action on behalf of the indemnified party or that there may be one or more legal defenses available to such indemnified party which are not available to the indemnifying party (in which case the indemnifying party shall not have the fight to assume the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party, it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable, in connection with any one such action or separate but substantially similar or related actions in the same Jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, for the

reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys for  the indemnified party, which firm shall be designated in writing by the  indemnified party).  The indemnifying party shall have the right, at its  option and unless so relieved, to compromise, at its own expense by its own  counsel, any such matter involving the asserted liability to a third party of  the indemnified party.  In the event that the indemnifying party shall  undertake to compromise any such asserted liability, the indemnifying party  shall notify the indemnified party promptly of its intention to do so.  In  the event that an indemnifying party after written notice from an indemnified





party fails to take timely action to defend any such damage, loss,  deficiency, liability, claimed encumbrance, penalty, cost, expense, action,  suit, investigation, proceeding, demand, assessment, audit, judgment or  claimed the indemnified party shall have the right to defend the same by  counsel of its own choosing but at the cost and expense of the indemnifying  party.

Section 10.1   NONCOMPETITION.  Each of Licensor and Licensee understands and acknowledges that Licensor shall be entitled to protect and preserve the going concern value of Licensor's business to the extent permitted by law and that Licensor would not have entered into this Agreement absent the provisions of this Section 10.1 and, therefore, each of Licensor and Licensee agrees that during the term of this Agreement Licensee shall not engage in, represent in any way or be connected with directly or indirectly any business competing with the Licensed Products.

                                        13

and in such a manner so as to not unreasonably interfere with such party's business operations.  The auditing party shall keep any and all information derived from any audits confidential.  Such information is deemed to be "Confidential Information" within the meaning of Article 10.  In relation to such information, the parties to this Agreement are subject to the obligations and remedies set forth in Article 10.  The auditing party shall not use such information for any purpose other than the purpose of the audit as stated in such party's written notification for such audit.  If an audit of Licensee's records and books of account reveals that Licensee has underpaid the fees due under this Agreement to Licensor for the period under audit, Licensee shall pay to Licensor promptly the amount of the underpayment.  If the amount of underpayment for the period under audit exceeds five percent (5%) of the total amount owed during such period, Licensee shall reimburse Licensor for all costs and expenses incurred by Licensor in connection with performing the audit.

                                      ARTICLE 12                                   LIMITED WARRANTIES
