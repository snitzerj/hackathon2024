Changepoint shall have no liability for any infringement          based on (i) the use of the Software other than as set forth in the          Documentation; (ii) the modification of the Software by a party other          than Changepoint, when such infringement would not have occurred but          for such modification, (iii) the combination of the Software with any          other hardware or software product or service when such infringement





         would not have occurred using the Software by itself or (iv) Corio's          copying, distribution or use of the Software after receiving          Changepoint's written notice to Corio of a third party claim of          infringement applicable to the Software.

 8.3     BY CORIO. Corio shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Changepoint          and its affiliated companies from any and all damages, liabilities,          costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) awarded by a          court against Changepoint and its affiliated companies, and from          settlements approved in writing by Corio, for infringement of any          patent, copyright, trademark or trade right secret of a third party          arising out (i) use of the Software by Corio other than as set forth in          the Documentation or as authorized by this Agreement; (ii) modification          of the Software by Corio except as authorized by Changepoint or by this          Agreement, when such infringement would not have occurred but for such          unauthorized modification, (iii) Corio's copying, distribution or use          of the Software after receiving Changepoint's written notice to Corio          of a third party claim of infringement applicable to the Software, or          (iv) a combination of the Software with other hardware or software          product or service, if such infringement would not have occurred using          the Software alone. Corio's obligation to indemnify Changepoint is          subject to Changepoint providing Corio with prompt written notice of          any such claim and promptly tendering the control and the defense and          settlement of any such claim to Corio at Corio's expense and with          Corio's choice of counsel. Nothing in this provision shall limit          Corio's immediate duty to defend Changepoint against any such claims.          Changepoint shall cooperate with Corio, at Corio's expense, in          defending or settling any such claims and Changepoint may join in          defense with counsel of its choice at its own expense.

THE          PARTIES AGREE THAT THIS SECTION 9 REPRESENTS A REASONABLE ALLOCATION          OF RISK.

10       CONFIDENTIALITY.

         Each party hereby agrees that it shall not use any Confidential          Information received from the other party other than as expressly          permitted under the terms of the non-disclosure agreement in effect          between the parties dated October 29, 1999, which is incorporated          herein by reference and made a part hereof. For purposes of this          Agreement, "Confidential Information" means the definition given to          that term in such non-disclosure agreement. The parties agree that          Changepoint's Software and Documentation (except that Documentation          which this Agreement contemplates will be provided to Customers) shall          be deemed Confidential Information subject to that non-disclosure          agreement. The terms and conditions of this Agreement shall also be          deemed Confidential Information subject to that non-disclosure          agreement, but the terms of this Agreement may be disclosed by a party          in connection with a significant transaction involving the merger or          sale of all or a substantial part of the assets of the receiving party.          Further, each party represents and warrants that their respective          employees, agents, contractors or consultants that will be provided the          other party's confidential information have or will have signed          agreements with customary terms containing confidentiality provisions          and assignment of inventions ("EMPLOYEE NDA/INVENTION AGREEMENT"). Each          party covenants that during the term of this Agreement, it will          continue to require all of such employees, agents, contractors or          consultants to sign an Employee NDA/Invention Agreement.

11       TERM AND TERMINATION.

11.1     TERM. The term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date          and, subject to the provisions of this Agreement, shall continue in          full force and effect for an initial period of five (5) years.          Thereafter, this Agreement shall automatically renew for subsequent one          (1) year periods unless either party provides the other party with          written notification at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration          of the initial five (5) year term or any one (1) year renewal thereof          of its intention to terminate this Agreement.

11.2     TERMINATION. If either party breaches any material term or condition of          this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within sixty (60) days          after receiving written notice of the breach, the nonbreaching party





         may terminate this Agreement on written notice at any time following          the end of such sixty (60) day period. Notwithstanding the foregoing,          Corio shall have thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of written          notice from Changepoint to cure any nonpayment. Compliance by the          Software with the Software's Documentation after expiration of the          Warranty Period shall be deemed a material condition of this Agreement.          To the extent permitted by applicable law, either party may terminate          this Agreement by

                                       14

         notice in writing to the other party in the event that (i) a          receiver, trustee, liquidator, administrator or administrative          receiver should be appointed for either party or its property, (ii)          either party should become insolvent or unable to pay its debts as          they mature or cease to pay its debts as they mature in the ordinary          course of business, or makes an assignment for the benefit of          creditors or makes a proposal to its creditors or files a notice of          intention to do so, (iii) any proceedings should be commenced          against either party under any bankruptcy, insolvency or debtor's          relief law, and such proceedings are not vacated or set aside within          fifteen (15) days from the date of commencement thereof, or (iv)          either party is liquidated or dissolved (except as part of an          assignment permitted under Section 14.1 of this Agreement).

11.3     EFFECT OF TERMINATION OR EXPIRATION. The following Sections shall          survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement according to          the provisions of this Section 11.3: 2.1, 2,2, 2.3, 4.2, 4,5, 4.6, 4.7,          5.3, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14 and Exhibits B and C.

Changepoint's obligation to provide Software Support          and Maintenance to Corio and its Customers shall survive any          termination or expiration of this Agreement for the remaining term of          any contracts Corio has with such Customers to continue providing the          Corio Services, provided Corio continues to make its revenue share fee          payments (and Software Support and Maintenance payments under Section          2.5 of this Agreement with respect to those licenses) to Changepoint as          specified in this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the license          grants in Sections 2.1 and 2.2 of this Agreement, and Changepoint's          continuing obligation to provide Software Support and Maintenance under          Sections 4.2 and 5.3 of this Agreement shall terminate if Changepoint          terminates this Agreement for Corio's non-payment or other material          breach according to the provisions of Section 11.2 of this Agreement.          Sections 7, 8, 9, 10, 12 and 14 of this Agreement shall survive          termination or expiration of this Agreement for any reason. Upon          termination or expiration of this Agreement, each party shall otherwise          return or destroy any Confidential Information of the other party          provided, however, Corio may retain such Confidential Information as is          necessary for Corio to continue supporting it's then-existing Customers          according to the provisions of this Section 11.3. Upon termination or          expiration of this Agreement, all outstanding and unpaid amounts owed          by Corio to Changepoint under this Agreement shall become immediately          due and payable. Section 2.3 of this Agreement shall survive for the          time period provided in such section.

12       SOURCE CODE ESCROW.

12.1     ESCROW ACCOUNT. Within sixty (60) days of the Effective Date,          Changepoint agrees to execute an escrow agreement by and among Corio,          Changepoint and a mutually acceptable escrow agent (the "ESCROW          AGENT"). The Escrow Agent shall require Changepoint to place in an          escrow account in Toronto a copy of the source code of the Software          including all Updates and Upgrades thereto, documentation and similar          materials (the "SOURCE CODE"). The escrow agreement shall contain, at a          minimum, the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 12. Corio          shall bear all fees, expenses and other charges to open and maintain          such escrow account. If a Release Condition (as defined in Section 12.2          of this Agreement) occurs and the Escrow Agent provides the Source Code          to Corio under the escrow agreement, Corio agrees to hold the Source          Code in strict confidence, and not to use the Source Code for any          purpose other than those purposes set forth under Section 12.3 of this          Agreement. This

                                       15

         source code escrow shall survive any termination or expiration of          this Agreement for the remaining term of any contracts Corio has          with such Customers to continue providing the Corio Services.

12.2     RELEASE. Corio shall notify Changepoint in writing if it believes that          one of the following events (the "RELEASE CONDITIONS") has occurred and          that it intends to seek release of the Source Code from the escrow          account: (i) Changepoint's dissolution or ceasing to do business in the          normal course, except as a result or a merger, amalgamation or sale of          all or a substantial part of the assets of Changepoint, or (ii)          Changepoint's repeated and material breach of Changepoint's Software          Support and Maintenance obligations defined under Section 5 of this          Agreement and EXHIBIT C pertaining to the correction of programming





         errors and such breach is not cured within sixty (60) days of receipt          of written notice thereof from Corio. If Changepoint notifies Corio in          writing that it disputes whether any such event has occurred, officers          of each of the parties shall negotiate for a period of ten (10)          business days to attempt to resolve the dispute. At the end of such ten          (10) business day period, if the parties have not resolved the dispute,          the matter shall be referred to dispute resolution in the manner set          forth in the escrow agreement and there shall be no release until the          dispute is resolved.

12.3     LICENSE. Upon the release of the Source Code to Corio pursuant to          Section 12.2 of this Agreement, Corio shall have a royalty-free,          nonexclusive, nontransferable, right and license at its head office to          use and modify the Source Code to support and maintain the Software          until the expiration or termination of Corio's Customers' License          Agreements for the Corio Services. The object code derived from the          Source Code so modified shall be subject to the same rights and          restrictions on use, reproduction and disclosure that are contained in          this Agreement with respect to the Software. Corio shall not          distribute, sell or sublicense the Source Code or use the Source Code          to develop new products or for commercial purposes other than to          support Customers of the Corio Services. Subject to the licenses          expressly granted in this Agreement, Changepoint shall retain all          right, title and interest in and to the Source Code. Corio may disclose          the Source Code to a contractor(s) for the purposes set forth in this          Section 12.3 provided that such contractor is not a direct or indirect          competitor of Changepoint of any affiliate of Changepoint, and provided          further that such contractor(s) agrees to maintain the Source Code in          strict confidence and to use the Source Code only as expressly          permitted under this Section 12. Access to the Source Code shall be on          a need to know only basis and shall be retained by contractors only for          so long as reasonably required for the purposes set forth in this          Section 12.

In the event Customer assigns this Agreement to a third person as permitted by this Section 9.7 or with consent from Changepoint, Customer shall cease all use of the Licensed Materials and destroy or cause to be destroyed all copies thereof within its possession or control and the third party assignee shall agree in writing with Changepoint to assume all of Customer's obligations hereunder. Customer shall also certify in writing to Changepoint that the foregoing has been accomplished. This Agreement shall enure to the benefit of and be binding upon any successor or assign of Changepoint or, any permitted successor or assign of Customer. The parties agree that Changepoint may delegate to affiliates of Changepoint and to agents, suppliers, contractors and resellers of Changepoint any of the obligations herein imposed upon Changepoint and





Changepoint may disclose to any such persons any information required by them to perform the duties so delegated to them, but such delegation shall not relieve Changepoint of its performance obligations hereunder.

9.8      WAIVER

 &sbsp;       No modification, addition to or waiver of any rights, obligations or defaults shall be effective unless in writing and signed by the party against whom the same is sought to be enforced. One or more waivers of any right, obligation or default shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent right, obligation or default. No delay or failure of either party in exercising any right hereunder and no partial or single exercise thereof shall be deemed of itself to constitute a waiver of such right or any other rights hereunder.

9.9      GOVERNING LAW

                 This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in                       accordance with the laws of the State of New York without                       reference to its conflict or choice of law rules or                       principles. Customer hereby submits to the non-exclusive                       jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York for                       any legal action arising out of this Agreement or the                       performance of the obligations hereunder or thereunder.                       This Agreement shall be deemed to be made in the State of                       New York, and Customer agrees not to commence any action,                       suit or proceeding against Changepoint or any affiliate of                       Changepoint or any of their employees, officers or                       directors in any jurisdiction other than the State of New                       York.

9.10     DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION

                 In the event that any dispute or disagreement between                       Customer and Changepoint with respect to the                       interpretation of any provision of this Agreement, the                       performance of Changepoint or Customer under this                       Agreement, or any other matter that is in dispute between                       the parties related to this Agreement, upon the written                       request of either party, the parties will meet for the                       purpose of resolving such dispute. The parties agree to                       discuss the problem and negotiate in good faith without                       the necessity of any formal proceedings related thereto.                       No formal proceedings for the resolution of such dispute                       may be commenced until either party concludes in good                       faith that the applicable resolution through continued                       negotiation of the matter in issue does not appear likely.                       The parties further agree that all disputes hereunder                       which cannot be settled in the manner hereinbefore                       described (any such dispute is referred to here as a                       "Dispute") will be settled by final and binding                       arbitration conducted in accordance with the American                       Arbitration Association (or any successor thereto), as                       amended from time to time. Judgment upon the award                       rendered in any such arbitration may be entered in any                       court having jurisdiction thereof, or application may be                       made to such court for a judicial acceptance of the award                       and an enforcement, as the law of such jurisdiction may                       require or allow.

         Notwithstanding the foregoing, disputes with respect to any Infringement Claim including without limitation any claim based on the infringement, violation or misappropriation of any Intellectual Property Right shall not be settled by arbitration, without the prior written consent of the parties.

                      The arbitration panel will be composed of one person                       appointed by the party requesting the arbitration (the                       "Applicant"), one person appointed by the other party (the                       "Respondent") and a third person to act as chairperson,                       chosen by the two arbitrators, or, if both parties agree,                       the arbitration panel will consist of a sole arbitrator.                       No person may be appointed as an arbitrator unless he or                       she is independent of the Applicant and Respondent, is                       skilled in the subject matter of the Dispute and is not                       directly or indirectly carrying on or involved in a                       business being carried on in competition with the business                       of the parties. The decision of the arbitration panel                       shall be made by a majority vote or by the sole                       arbitrator, as the case may be. In the event of the                       failure of the arbitration panel to reach a majority                       decision, the decision of the chairperson shall constitute                       the decision of the arbitration panel. The venue for the                       arbitration shall be at the City of New York, New York                       unless otherwise agreed to by the parties in writing.
