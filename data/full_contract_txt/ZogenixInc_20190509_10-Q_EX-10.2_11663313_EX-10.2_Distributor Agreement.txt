Amount of Product Supplied per Fiscal Year Net Price Markup

For the portion of Product supplied less than or equal to the equivalent of [***] in Net Sales in such Fiscal Year [***]

For the portion of Product supplied in excess of the equivalent of [***] in Net Sales in such Fiscal Year [***]

The Net Sales equivalent described in the left column of the table above is calculated by determining the total number of units ordered in the applicable Fiscal Year and multiplying such number by the Net Price for such Fiscal Year.

Following the expiration of the Distribution Term and during the remaining Term of this Agreement, for all Product supplied by Zogenix to Distributor under purchase orders submitted pursuant to the Supply Agreement in a particular Fiscal Year, Distributor shall pay to Zogenix the Transfer Price per unit of Product supplied shall be equal to the sum of (i) [***] of the Fully-Burdened Manufacturing Cost per unit of Product for such Fiscal Year, and (ii) [***] of aggregate annual Net Sales for such Fiscal Year.

(b) Estimates. No later than [***] before the beginning of each Fiscal Year, starting with the Fiscal Year in which the First Commercial Sale is anticipated to occur, the Parties shall discuss in good faith and agree on a reasonable estimate of the Net Price for the Product for such Fiscal Year, which estimate will be based on a reasonable approximation of the aggregate Net Sales of Product to be recognized by Distributor and its Affiliates during such Fiscal Year. The agreed Net Price will be used to calculate the Transfer Price initially invoiced by Zogenix and payable by Distributor for the total number of units of the Product ordered by

26

(d) True-Up. For each Annual Report, if the amount in clause (G) of such Annual Report exceeds the amount in clause (F), then Distributor shall pay the amount in clause (H) to Zogenix concurrently with its delivery of such Annual Report to Zogenix. Otherwise, if the amount in clause (G) is less than the amount in clause (F), the amount in clause (H) will be credited against the subsequent payment(s) due from Distributor to Zogenix (or if no further payments will be due, paid by Zogenix to Distributor within [***] after Zogenix's receipt of such Annual Report from Distributor).

7.2 Currency Conversion. For the purpose of calculating any sums due under this Agreement and determining the annual Net Sales levels in Section 6.5, conversion shall be made to U.S. dollars by using the arithmetic mean of the exchange rates for the purchase of United States dollars as published in The Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition, for each Business Day in the Fiscal Quarter to which such calculations relate.

7.3 Taxes. Any taxes imposed on Distributor or with respect to Distributor's business operations or activities hereunder, including any value added taxes, consumption, transfer, sales, use or other such taxes relating to the transactions contemplated herein, shall be borne by Distributor, and Distributor shall timely pay, and indemnify and hold harmless, Zogenix from and against all such taxes, including any penalties or interest associated therewith. If Distributor is required by Applicable Law to deduct and withhold taxes from a payment due and payable to Zogenix hereunder (excluding national, state or local taxes based on income to Zogenix), Distributor shall: (a) promptly notify Zogenix of such requirement; (b) make such required deduction and withholding from the corresponding payment; (c) pay to the relevant Governmental Authority the full amount required to be so deducted and withheld; and (d) promptly forward to Zogenix an official receipt or other documentation reasonably acceptable to Zogenix evidencing such payment to such Governmental Authority(ies).

Such records shall be subject to inspection in accordance with Section 7.5.

7.5 Audits.

interest under Section 7.6 for underpaid amounts) shall be made by the Parties to reflect the results of such audit. Such inspections may be made no more than once each Fiscal Year (unless an audit or inspection reveals a material inaccuracy in reports made under this Agreement, in which case it may be repeated within such Fiscal Year), and during normal business hours, with reasonable efforts to minimize disruption of Distributor's normal business activities. Inspections conducted under this Section 7.5 shall be at the expense of Zogenix, unless a variation or error producing an underpayment in amounts payable exceeding [***] of the amount paid for a period covered by the inspection is established, in which case all reasonable costs relating to the inspection for such period shall be paid by Distributor. Absent manifest error, the accountant's report will be final and binding on the Parties.

The payment of such interest shall not limit a Party from exercising any other rights it may have as a consequence of the lateness of any payment.

ARTICLE 8. CONFIDENTIALITY

8.1 Confidential Information. Except to the extent expressly authorized by this Agreement or otherwise agreed in writing by the Parties, the Parties agree that during the Term and for [***] thereafter, the receiving Party (the "Receiving Party") shall keep confidential and shall not publish or otherwise disclose or use for any purpose other than as provided for in this Agreement or the Supply Agreement any Information or materials furnished to it or its Affiliates by or on behalf of the other Party (the "Disclosing Party") or its Affiliates pursuant to this Agreement, the Supply Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement or any other written agreement between the Parties or their Affiliates, in any form (written, oral, photographic, electronic, magnetic, or otherwise), including all information concerning the Product and any other technical or business information of whatever nature (collectively, "Confidential Information" of the Disclosing Party). All Zogenix Technology (including, without limitation, all Product Inventions and Data) shall be deemed the Confidential Information of Zogenix. Distributor Inventions shall be deemed the Confidential Information of Distributor. Joint Inventions shall be deemed the Confidential Information of each of Zogenix and Distributor. Each Party may use the Confidential Information of the other Party only to the extent required to accomplish the purposes of this Agreement or the Supply Agreement (including to exercise its rights or fulfill its obligations under this Agreement or the Supply Agreement).

Confidential Information of the other Party. Each Party will promptly notify the other upon discovery of any unauthorized use or disclosure of the Confidential Information of the other Party.

8.2 Exceptions.

Source: ZOGENIX, INC., 10-Q, 5/9/2019





bound by confidentiality and non-use obligations that are no less stringent than those confidentiality and non-use provisions contained in this Agreement.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event a Party is required to make a disclosure of the other Party's Confidential Information pursuant to Section 8.3(b) or (c), it will, except where impracticable, give reasonable advance notice to the other Party of such disclosure and use efforts to secure confidential treatment of such information at least as diligent as such Party would use to protect its own confidential information, but in no event less than reasonable efforts. In any event, the Parties agree to take all reasonable action to avoid disclosure of Confidential Information hereunder.

8.4 Confidentiality of this Agreement and its Terms. Except as otherwise provided in this Article 8, each Party agrees not to disclose to any Third Party the existence of this Agreement or the terms of this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Party, except that each Party may disclose the terms of this Agreement that are not otherwise made public as contemplated by Section 8.5 as permitted under Section 8.3.

8.5 Public Announcements.

(a) As soon as practicable following the Effective Date, the Parties may each issue a press release in English and/or Japanese, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit 8.5(a), announcing the existence of this Agreement. Except as required by Applicable Laws (including disclosure requirements of the SEC or any stock exchange on which securities issued by a Party or its Affiliates are traded), neither Party shall make any other public announcement concerning this Agreement or the subject matter hereof without the prior written consent of the other, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided that each Party may make any public statement in response to questions by the press, analysts, investors or those attending industry conferences or financial analyst calls, or issue press releases, so long as any such public statement or press release is not inconsistent with prior public disclosures or public statements approved by the other Party pursuant to this Section 8.5 and does not reveal nonâpublic information about the other Party; and provided further that Zogenix may make public statements regarding the results of Development and Commercialization activities in the Territory. In the event of a public announcement required by Applicable Laws, to the extent practicable under the circumstances, the Party making such announcement shall provide the other Party with a copy of the proposed text of such announcement sufficiently in advance of the scheduled release to afford such other Party a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon the proposed text.

(b) The Parties will coordinate in advance with each other in connection with the filing of this Agreement (including redaction of certain provisions of this Agreement) with the SEC or any stock exchange on which securities issued by a Party or its Affiliate are traded, and each Party will use reasonable efforts to seek confidential treatment for the terms proposed to be redacted; provided that each Party will ultimately retain control over what information to disclose to the SEC or other applicable government body, and provided further that the Parties will use their reasonable efforts to file redacted versions with any governing bodies which are consistent with redacted versions previously filed with any other governing bodies. Other than

31

US-DOCS\105216871.19

Source: ZOGENIX, INC., 10-Q, 5/9/2019





such obligation, neither Party (nor its Affiliates) will be obligated to consult with or obtain approval from the other Party with respect to any filings to the SEC or any other government body governing a stock exchange.

(c) Except as expressly permitted in this Agreement or as required by Applicable Laws, neither Party may use the other Party's trademarks, service marks or trade names, or otherwise refer to or identify that other Party in marketing or promotional materials, press releases, statements to news media or other public announcements, without the other Party's prior written consent, which that other Party may grant or withhold in its sole discretion.

8.6 Publication. At least [***] prior to Distributor or its Affiliates or Sub-distributors publishing, publicly presenting, and/or submitting for written or oral publication a manuscript, presentation, abstract, marketing document or the like that includes Information relating to the Product that has not been previously published, Distributor shall provide to Zogenix's Alliance Manager a draft copy thereof for Zogenix's review (unless Distributor is required by Applicable Laws to publish such Information sooner, in which case Distributor shall provide such draft copy to Zogenix's Alliance Manager as much in advance of such publication as possible). Distributor shall consider in good faith any comments provided by Zogenix during such [***] period, and in the event that Zogenix raises any concerns the matter shall be raised at the JSC; provided that Distributor shall, at Zogenix's reasonable request, cease such proposed publication or remove therefrom any information requested by Zogenix. The contribution of each Party shall be noted in all publications or presentations by acknowledgment or co-authorship, whichever is appropriate.

8.7 Prior Non-Disclosure Agreements. As of the Effective Date, the terms of this Article 8 shall supersede any prior non-disclosure, secrecy or confidentiality agreement between the Parties (or their Affiliates) dealing with the subject of this Agreement, including the Confidentiality Agreement, but excluding any terms of the Supply Agreement. Any information disclosed under such prior agreements shall be deemed disclosed under this Agreement.

8.8 Equitable Relief. Given the nature and value of the Confidential Information and the competitive damage and irreparable harm that would result to a Party upon unauthorized disclosure, use or transfer of its Confidential Information to any Third Party, the Parties agree that monetary damages may not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Article 8. If the Receiving Party becomes aware of any breach or threatened breach of this Article 8 by the Receiving Party or a Third Party to whom the Receiving Party disclosed the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information, the Receiving Party promptly shall notify the Disclosing Party and cooperate with the Disclosing Party to regain possession of its Confidential Information and prevent any further breach. In addition to all other remedies, a Party shall be entitled to seek specific performance and injunctive and other equitable relief as a remedy for any breach or threatened breach of this Article 8 without furnishing proof of actual damages or posting a bond.

(b) Control of Action. Each Party shall share with the other Party all information available to it regarding such alleged or threatened infringement by a Third Party. Zogenix shall have the sole right, but not the obligation, to bring and control any action or proceeding with respect to alleged or threatened infringement by a Third Party in the Territory of any Zogenix Patent at Zogenix's cost and expense. If Zogenix elects to commence a suit to enforce the applicable Zogenix Patent against such infringements, then Distributor shall have the right to join such enforcement action, if permitted by Applicable Law, upon notice to Zogenix and be represented by a counsel of its own choice at its own cost and expense.

(c) Recoveries. Any monetary recovery resulting from actions or proceedings under this Section 9.3 will be allocated as follows: each of Distributor and Zogenix first will be reimbursed, out of such recovery, for its reasonable and verifiable costs and expenses with respect to such action or proceeding (such reimbursement to be pro-rata based on the Parties' relative costs and expenses if the recovery is not sufficient to reimburse both Parties fully) with any remainder being (i) allocated [***] if[***] or (ii) allocated [***] if [***].

The Parties then shall discuss the matter and seek in good faith to agree on whether the Parties should take a license under such Patent, and if so, on what terms; provided, that if the Parties are unable to agree after a reasonable period, [***], of good faith discussions, then Zogenix shall have the right to obtain such a license on such terms as it determines in its sole discretion and at its own cost and expense.

In any event, Zogenix agrees to keep Distributor reasonably informed of all material developments in connection with any such action. Zogenix agrees not to settle such infringement or make any admissions or assert any position in such action in a manner that would materially adversely affect the rights or interest of Distributor, without the prior written consent of Distributor, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. Neither Party shall enter into any settlement or compromise of any action under this Section 9.4 which would in any manner alter, diminish, or be in derogation of the other Party's rights under this Agreement without the prior written consent of such other Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

9.5 Patent Term Restoration.

11.2 Indemnification of Distributor. Zogenix shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Distributor and its Affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents (the "Distributor Indemnitees"), from and against any and all Losses incurred by any Distributor Indemnitee resulting from any Third Party Claims to the extent arising from, or occurring as a result of: (a) the manufacture, use, handling, storage, import, offer for sale, sale or other disposition of the Product outside the Territory by or on behalf of Zogenix or its Affiliates; (b) the negligence or willful misconduct of any Zogenix Indemnitees in connection with Zogenix's performance of its obligations or exercise of its rights under this Agreement; or (c) any breach of any representations, warranties or covenants of Zogenix in this Agreement, except to the extent such Third Party Claims fall within the scope of the indemnification obligations of Distributor set forth in Section 11.1 or arise out of the breach by Distributor of any of the terms of the Supply Agreement.

11.3 Procedure. A Party that intends to claim indemnification under this Article 11 (the "Indemnitee") shall promptly notify the indemnifying Party (the "Indemnitor") in writing of any Third Party Claim, in respect of which the Indemnitee intends to claim such indemnification, and the Indemnitor shall have sole control of the defense and/or settlement thereof. The Indemnitee may participate at its expense in the Indemnitor's defense of and settlement negotiations for any Third Party Claim with counsel of the Indemnitee's own selection. The indemnity arrangement in this Article 11 shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any action with respect to a Third Party Claim, if such settlement is effected without the consent of the Indemnitor, which consent shall not be withheld or delayed unreasonably. The failure to deliver written notice to the Indemnitor within a reasonable time after the commencement of any action with respect to a Third Party Claim shall only relieve the Indemnitor of its indemnification obligations under this Article 11 if and to the extent the Indemnitor is actually prejudiced thereby. The Indemnitee shall cooperate fully with the Indemnitor and its legal representatives in the investigation of any action with respect to a Third Party Claim covered by this indemnification.

42

US-DOCS\105216871.19

Source: ZOGENIX, INC., 10-Q, 5/9/2019





notice of such breach to the other Party, and the allegedly breaching Party shall have [***] from receipt of such notice to dispute the validity of such breach. For all breaches of this Agreement, the allegedly breaching Party shall have [***] from the receipt of the initial notice to cure such breach. If the Party receiving notice of breach fails to cure the breach within such [***] period, then the non-breaching Party may terminate this Agreement in its entirety effective on written notice of termination to the other Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) if such material breach (other than a payment breach), by its nature, is curable, but is not reasonably curable within the [***] period, then such period shall be extended if the breaching Party provides a written plan for curing such breach to the non-breaching Party and uses Commercially Reasonable Efforts to cure such breach in accordance with such written plan; provided, that no such extension shall exceed [***] without the consent of the non-breaching Party.

(e) Diligence. Zogenix shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 5.1(d).

(f) Bankruptcy.

(g) Commercial Viability. In the event that prior to launch of the Product in the Field in the Territory (i) either Party has a good faith concern that the launch of the Product in the Field in the Territory is not likely to be possible with Commercially Reasonable Efforts, based upon credible evidence, such as any decision by a Regulatory Authority to require significant additional information before granting or as a condition to granting Regulatory Approval, or (ii) Distributor has a good faith concern that the Commercialization of the Product in the Territory will not be commercially viable, such Party may raise such concern for discussion by the JSC. If, within the time periods set forth in Section 3.1(d) or such longer time period as the Parties may mutually agree upon in writing, neither the JSC nor the Executives agree whether to launch or commercialize Product in the Territory, then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 3.1(d) or Article 13, either Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon at least [***] written notice to the other Party.

the Territory in the Field without infringing such issued Patent.

(i) Change of Control. This Agreement may be terminated by either Party upon [***] written notice to the other Party in the event that the other Party undergoes a Change of Control; provided, however, that such termination notice shall only be effective if delivered within [***] after the later of the occurrence of such Change of Control or the date the Party undergoing the Change of Control delivers written notice thereof to the other Party.

(l) Distributor Safety Concern. This Agreement may be terminated by Distributor upon written notice to Zogenix, in the event that Distributor has a reasonable belief after due inquiry that the promotion of the Product in the Field in the Territory presents a substantial risk of harm or injury to consumers which risk is unacceptable according to established principles of medical ethics.
