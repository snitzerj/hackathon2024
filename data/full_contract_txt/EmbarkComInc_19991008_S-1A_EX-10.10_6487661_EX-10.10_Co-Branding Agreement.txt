SECTION 8.  GENERAL PROVISIONS

      8.1   CONFIDENTIALITY. During the Term, and for a period of five (5) years thereafter, the receiving party will not disclose to others or use for any purpose of its own, other than in performance of this Agreement, any Confidential Information of the other party. Each party shall take, at a minimum, measures consistent with those taken to protect its own similar types of Confidential Information (and in any event, at least reasonable measures) to protect the other's Confidential Information against disclosures prohibited by this Agreement. Each party acknowledges that its breach of the provisions of this Section 8.1  [CONFIDENTIALITY] will result in immediate and irreparable harm to the other and that money damages alone would be inadequate to compensate such party.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the restrictions set forth in this Section 8.1  [CONFIDENTIALITY] shall not apply to any information that: (i) is in or enters the public domain through no fault of the receiving party; (ii) is disclosed to the receiving party by a third party legally entitled to make such disclosure; (iii) is independently developed by the receiving party without reference to any Confidential Information of the other party; or (iv) is required to be disclosed by applicable law, regulation or order of any governmental authority; provided, that in such event, the receiving party shall provide the disclosing party with prior notice that is reasonable in the circumstances of such disclosure and shall use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the disclosing party to minimize the extent and scope of such disclosure.

      8.2   INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. Sponsor and Snap are independent contractors under this Agreement, and nothing herein shall be construed to create a partnership, joint venture, franchise or agency relationship between Sponsor and Snap. Neither party has any authority to enter into agreements of any kind on behalf of the other party.

      8.3   ASSIGNMENT. Neither party may assign this Agreement or any of its rights or delegate any of its duties under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party, not to be unreasonably withheld; except that either party may, without the other party's consent, assign this Agreement or any of its rights or delegate any of its duties under this Agreement: (a) to any corporate affiliate of such party; or (b) to any purchaser of all or substantially all of such party's assets or to any successor by way of merger, consolidation or similar transaction. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement will be binding upon, enforceable by, and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and assigns.

      8.4   CHOICE OF LAW; FORUM SELECTION. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of California without reference to its choice of law rules. Sponsor hereby irrevocably consents to personal jurisdiction and venue in the state and federal courts located in San Francisco, California with respect to any actions, claims or proceedings arising out of or in connection with this Agreement.

      8.5   NONWAIVER. No waiver of any breach of any provision of this Agreement shall constitute a waiver of any prior, concurrent or subsequent breach of the same or any other provisions hereof, and no waiver shall be effective unless made in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the waiving party.

Either party may from time to time change the person to receive notices or its address by giving the other party notice of the change in accordance with this section:

      8.8   INTEGRATION.

If any provision of this Agreement shall be adjudged by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.
