DISTRIBUTOR is not authorized to make warranties or          representations on behalf of PPG SHANGHAI and shall make no such          warranties or representations.

12.      FORCE MAJEURE

Such party shall promptly notify the other party when such force majeure circumstance has ceased to affect its ability to perform its obligations hereunder. The quantity to be delivered hereunder shall be reduced to the extent of the deliveries omitted for such cause or causes, unless both parties agree that the total quantity to be delivered hereunder shall remain unchanged. For so long as its ability to perform hereunder is affected by such force majeure circumstance, PPG SHANGHAI may, at its option, elect to allocate its total production of Product among its various requirements therefor (e.g., manufacturing and sales) in such manner as PPG SHANGHAI deems practicable and which, in the opinion of PPG SHANGHAI, is fair and reasonable. During the time that PPG SHANGHAI is unable to make deliveries or otherwise perform, it shall not be obligated to procure, or to use its best efforts to procure, any quantity of Product sold hereunder from any alternate producer or supplier.

DISTRIBUTOR acknowledges that it has experience and expertise in handling and storing the Products, and that DISTRIBUTOR has the obligation to handle, store and distribute the Products safely and properly.

14.      PRODUCT SAFETY
