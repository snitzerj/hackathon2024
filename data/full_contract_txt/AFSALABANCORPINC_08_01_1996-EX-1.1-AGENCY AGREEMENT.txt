Capital Resources, Inc. 1701 K Street, N.W. Suite 700 Washington, D.C. 20006

Ladies and Gentlemen:

                  AFSALA  Bancorp,  Inc. (the  "Company") and Amsterdam  Federal Savings and Loan  Association,  a federally  chartered  mutual  savings and loan association  ("Association"),  with its deposit  accounts insured by the Savings Association   Insurance  Fund  ("SAIF")  administered  by  the  Federal  Deposit Insurance  Corporation  ("FDIC"),  hereby  confirm their  agreement with Capital Resources, Inc. ("Capital Resources") as follows:

                  SECTION 1. The Offering.  The Association,  in accordance with and pursuant to its plan of conversion  adopted by the Board of Directors of the Association  (the "Plan"),  intends to be converted  from a  federally-chartered mutual savings and loan association to a federally-chartered  stock savings bank and will  sell all of its  issued  and  outstanding  stock to the  Company.  The Company  will  offer  and  sell its  common  stock  (the  "Common  Stock")  in a subscription  offering  ("Subscription  Offering") to (1) tax qualified employee benefit plans of the Association,  (2) depositors of the Association as of March 31, 1995 ("Eligible Account  Holders"),  (3) depositors of the Association as of June 30, 1996  ("Supplemental  Eligible  Account  Holders"),  (4) certain  other deposit  account  holders  and  borrower  members  of  the  Association  ("Other Members") and (5) to its employees,  officers and directors,  pursuant to rights to  subscribe  for shares of Common Stock (the  "Shares").  Subject to the prior subscription rights of the above-listed  parties, the Company may offer for sale in a public offering (the "Public  Offering," and when referred to together with the Subscription  Offering,  the "Subscription and Public Offerings")  conducted after the Subscription  Offering, the Shares not so subscribed for or ordered in the  Subscription  Offering  to the  general  public  (all such  offerees  being referred to in the aggregate as "Eligible Offerees"). Shares may also be sold in the Public Offering by a selling group of  broker-dealers  organized and managed by Capital  Resources.  It is  acknowledged  that the  purchase of Shares in the Subscription  and Public  Offerings  is subject to maximum and minimum  purchase limitations as described in the Plan and that the Company may reject in whole or in part any subscriptions received from subscribers in the Public Offering.

                  The  Company  and the  Association  desire to  retain  Capital Resources to assist the Company with its sale of the Shares in the  Subscription and Public  Offerings.  By and  through  this  Agreement,  the  Company  and the Association confirm the retention of Capital Resources to assist the Company and the Association during the Subscription and Public Offerings.

                  The  Company  has  filed  with  the  Securities  and  Exchange Commission  (the  "Commission")  a registration  statement on Form S-l (File No. 333-6399)  containing an offering  prospectus  relating to the  Subscription and Public  Offerings for the registration of the Shares under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"),  and has filed such  amendments  thereto,  if any, and such amended  prospectuses as may have been required to the date hereof (the  "Registration  Statement").  The prospectus,  as amended,  included in the Registration   Statement  at  the  time  it  initially  becomes  effective,   is hereinafter called the "Offering  Prospectus",  except that if any prospectus is filed by the Company pursuant to Rule 424(b) or (c) of the rules and regulations of the Commission under the 1933 Act (the "1933 Act Regulations") differing from the offering  prospectus  included in the Registration  Statement at the time it initially becomes effective,  the term "Offering  Prospectus" shall refer to the offering prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) or (c) from and after the time said offering prospectus is filed with or mailed to the Commission for filing.

                  In accordance  with Title 12, Part 563b of the Code of Federal Regulations (the "Conversion  Regulations"),  the Association has filed with the Office  of Thrift  Supervision  (the  "OTS")  an  Application  for  Approval  of Conversion  on Form AC (the  "Conversion  Application")  including  the Offering





Prospectus  and has filed  such  amendments  thereto,  if any,  as may have been required by the OTS. The  Conversion  Application  has been approved by the OTS. The Company has filed with the OTS its application on Form H-(e)lS (the "Holding Company  Application")  to acquire the  Association  under the Home Owners' Loan Act, as amended (12 U.S.C. ss. 1467a) ("HOLA").

                  SECTION 2. Retention of Capital Resources;  Compensation; Sale and  Delivery  of the  Shares.  Subject to the terms and  conditions  herein set forth, the Company and the Association hereby appoint Capital Resources as their agent to advise and assist the Company and the  Association  with the  Company's sale of the Shares in the Subscription and Public Offerings.

                  On  the  basis  of  the   representations,   warranties,   and agreements herein contained,  but subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, Capital Resources accepts such appointment and agrees to consult with and advise the Company and the Association as to matters  relating to the Conversion and the Subscription and Public Offerings. It is acknowledged by the Company and the  Association  that Capital  Resources  shall not be required to purchase any Shares and shall not be obligated to take any action which is inconsistent  with any  applicable  laws,  regulations,  decisions  or orders.  If requested by the Company or the  Association,  Capital  Resources  also may assemble and manage a selling group of broker dealers which are members of the National Association of Securities  Dealers,  Inc. (the "NASD") to  participate in the  solicitation  of purchase  orders  for  Shares  under a selected  dealers'  agreement  ("Selected Dealers'  Agreement").  The  obligations of Capital  Resources  pursuant to this Agreement  shall  terminate upon the completion or termination or abandonment of the  Plan  by  the  Company  or  the  Association  or  upon  termination  of the Subscription  and  Public  Offerings,  or if the  terms  of the  Conversion  are substantially  amended  so as to  materially  and  adversely  change the role of Capital  Resources,  but in no event later than 45 days after the  completion of the Subscription and Public Offerings (the "End Date").  All fees due to Capital Resources  but unpaid will be payable to Capital  Resources in next day funds at the earlier of the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined) or the End Date. In the event the  Subscription  and Public  Offerings are extended beyond the End Date, the Company, the

                                       -2-

Association  and Capital  Resources may mutually  agree to renew this  Agreement under mutually acceptable terms.

                  In the event  the  Company  is  unable  to sell a  minimum  of 935,000  Shares  within  the  period  herein  provided,   this  Agreement  shall terminate,  and the Company shall refund to any persons who have  subscribed for any of the Shares,  the full amount  which it may have  received  from them plus accrued  interest  as set  forth  in the  Offering  Prospectus;  and none of the parties  to this  Agreement  shall  have any  obligation  to the  other  parties hereunder,  except as set forth in this  Section 2 and in  Sections  7, 9 and 10 hereof.

                  In the event the closing  does not occur,  the  Conversion  is terminated  or  otherwise  abandoned,   or  the  terms  of  the  Conversion  are substantially  amended  so as to  materially  and  adversely  change the role of Capital  Resources,  Capital  Resources  shall be reimbursed  for all reasonable legal fees and  out-of-pocket  expenses for  rendering  financial  advice to the Association  concerning the structure of the Conversion,  preparing a market and financial analysis, performing due diligence and assisting in the preparation of the Application for Conversion and the  Registration  Statement,  which shall be paid upon such termination, abandonment or amendment or within five days of such event.

                  If  all  conditions  precedent  to  the  consummation  of  the Conversion,  including,  without limitation,  the sale of all Shares required by the Plan to be sold, are  satisfied,  the Company agrees to issue or have issued the Shares  sold in the  Subscription  and Public  Offerings  and to release for delivery  certificates  for such  Shares  on the  Closing  Date (as  hereinafter defined)  against  payment to the Company by any means  authorized  by the Plan, provided,  however, that no certificates shall be released for such shares until the  conditions  specified in Section 7 hereof shall have been  complied with to the reasonable satisfaction of Capital Resources and its counsel. The release of Shares against payment  therefor shall be made on a date and at a time and place acceptable to the Company, the Association and Capital Resources.  The date upon which the Company shall  release or deliver the Shares sold in the  Subscription and Public Offerings,  in accordance with the terms hereof, is herein called the "Closing Date."

                  Capital Resources shall receive the following compensation for its services hereunder:

                  (a) (i) a  marketing  fee in the  amount  of (x)  two  percent (2.0%) of the aggregate dollar amount of all Shares sold in the Subscription and Public Offerings,  excluding sales made through broker assisted  purchases or by other NASD member firms  participating  in the Subscription and Public Offerings pursuant  to  the  Selected  Dealers'  Agreement,  if  any  (for  which  Capital Resources'  compensation shall be pursuant to sub-paragraph  (ii)) and excluding shares sold to the  Association's  Employee  Stock  Ownership  Plan,  directors, officers or employees and any member of such person's  immediate family (defined to include children, spouse, parents, grandparents and grandchildren);

                           (ii)    a management fee in the amount of one percent and one-half (1.5%) of the aggregate dollar amount of Shares sold through broker assisted  purchases or through selected dealers, if any.





                  (b) Capital  Resources  shall be reimbursed for all reasonable out-of-pocket  expenses,  including,  but not  limited to,  legal fees,  travel, communications  and  postage,  incurred by it whether or not the  Conversion  is successfully completed as set forth in Section 7 hereof. Capital Resources shall be  reimbursed  promptly  for all  out-of-pocket  expenses  upon  receipt by the Company or the Association of a monthly  itemized bill summarizing such expenses since the date of the last bill, if any, to the date

                                       -3-

of the current bill.

                  In the event other broker-dealers are assembled and managed by Capital  Resources  under a  selling  syndicate  to  participate  in the  Public Offering  pursuant to the  Selected  Dealers'  Agreement or  participate  in the Public Offering as assisting  brokers,  the Company and the Association  will be directly  responsible for the payment of selected  dealers'  commissions to such participating  firms or assisting  brokers'  commissions up to a maximum of four percent (4%) and four percent (4%), respectively, of the amount of stock sold by such firms.  Capital Resources' fees are limited to those stated in subparagraph (a) above and all other  brokers  will be paid fees based upon the  capacity  in which they are acting in the particular stock sale.

                  All subscription  funds received by Capital  Resources (and if by check  shall be made  payable to the  Company)  or by other  NASD  registered broker-dealers soliciting subscriptions (if any) shall be transmitted (either by U.S.  Mail  or  similar  type  of  transmittal)  to the  Company  by noon of the following business day.

                  SECTION  3.  Offering  Prospectus;   Subscription  and  Public Offerings. The Shares are to be initially offered in the Subscription and Public Offerings at the  Purchase  Price as set forth on the cover page of the Offering Prospectus.

                  SECTION 4.  Representations and Warranties.  The Company and  the Association jointly and severally represent and warrant to Capital Resources as follows:

                  (a) The Registration  Statement was declared  effective by the Commission  on  __________,  1996.

                  (c) The  Company  has filed with the OTS the  Holding  Company Application  and will have  received,  as of the Closing  Date,  approval of its acquisition of the Association from the OTS.

                  (d) No order has been issued by the OTS, the  Commission,  the FDIC (and  hereinafter  reference to the FDIC shall include the SAIF), or to the best knowledge of the Company or the  Association  any State  regulatory or Blue Sky authority,  preventing or suspending the use of the Offering  Prospectus and no action by or  before  any such  government  entity  to revoke  any  approval, authorization  or order of  effectiveness  related to the  Conversion is, to the best knowledge of the Association or the Company, pending or threatened.

                  (e) At the  Closing  Date  referred  to in Section 2, the Plan will have been  adopted by the Board of  Directors  of both the  Company and the Association,  the Company and the Association will have completed all conditions precedent to the  Conversion and the offer and sale of the Shares will have been conducted in accordance with the Plan, the Conversion  Regulations and all other applicable  laws,  regulations,  decisions  and  orders,  including  all  terms, conditions, requirements and provisions precedent to the Conversion imposed upon the  Company  or the  Association  by  the  OTS,  the  Commission  or any  other regulatory authority and in the manner described in the Offering Prospectus.  At the  Closing  Date,  no person  will have  sought to obtain  review of the final action of the OTS,  to the  knowledge  of the  Company  or the  Association,  in approving the Plan or in approving the  Conversion or the Company's  application to acquire all of the capital stock and control of the  Association  pursuant to the HOLA or any other statute or regulation.

                  (f)  The  Association  is now a  duly  organized  and  validly existing  federally-chartered  savings  and loan  association  in mutual form of organization  and upon the  Conversion  will become a duly organized and validly existing federally-chartered savings bank in capital stock form of organization, in both instances  duly  authorized to conduct its business and own its property as described in the  Registration  Statement  and the Offering  Prospectus;  the Company and the  Association  have obtained all material  licenses,  permits and other  governmental  authorizations  currently required for the conduct of their respective   businesses;   all   such   licenses,   permits   and   governmental authorizations are in full force and effect, and the Company and the Association are in all material  respects  complying with all laws,  rules,  regulations and orders applicable to the operation of their  businesses;  and the Association is in good standing  under the laws of the United States and is duly qualified as a foreign  corporation  to  transact  business  and is in  good  standing  in each jurisdiction  in which its ownership of property or leasing of properties or the conduct of its business requires such qualification, unless the failure to be so qualified in one or more of such jurisdictions would not have a material adverse effect on the condition,  financial or otherwise, or the business, operations or income of the Association. The Association does not own

                                       -5-

The Conversion will have been effected in  all  material   respects  in  accordance   with  all  applicable   statutes, regulations,  decisions  and orders;  and except  with  respect to the filing of certain post-sale,  post-conversion reports and documents in compliance with the 1933 Act Regulations or the OTS's resolutions or letters of approval. All terms, conditions,  requirements and provisions with respect to the Conversion  imposed by the Commission, the OTS and the FDIC, if any, will have been complied with by the Company and the Association in all material respects or appropriate  waivers will have been  obtained and all material  notice and waiting  periods will have been satisfied, waived or elapsed.

                  (g) The  Company  has been duly  incorporated  and is  validly existing  as a  corporation  in good  standing  under  the laws of the  State of Delaware  with  corporate  power and  authority  to own,  lease and  operate its properties  and to  conduct  its  business  as  described  in  the  Registration Statement  and the  Offering  Prospectus,  and the  Company is  qualified  to do business as a foreign  corporation in any  jurisdiction  in which the conduct of its business requires such qualification, except where the failure to so qualify would not have a material adverse effect on the business of the Company.

                  (h) The  Association is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York ("FHLBNY");  and the deposit accounts of the Association are insured by the FDIC up to the applicable  limits.  Upon  consummation of the Conversion, the  liquidation  account  for the  benefit  of  Eligible  Account  Holders  and Supplemental  Eligible  Account  Holders will be duly  established in accordance with the requirements of the Conversion Regulations.

                  (i) The Company and the  Association  have good and marketable title to all assets  owned by them which are  material  to the  business  of the Company and the  Association and to those assets  described in the  Registration Statement and Offering Prospectus as owned by them, free and clear of all liens, charges,  encumbrances  or  restrictions,  except such as are  described  in the Registration Statement and Offering Prospectus or are not materially significant or important in relation to the business of the Company and the Association; and all of the leases and subleases  material to the business of the Company and the Association  under  which  the  Company  or the  Association  holds  properties, including those described in the Registration Statement and Offering Prospectus,

                  (k)      The Company and the Association have all such power, authority, authorizations, approvals and orders as may be required to enter into this Agreement, to carry out the provisions and conditions hereof and to issue  and sell the Capital Stock of the Association to the Company and Shares to be sold by the Company as provided herein and as described in the Offering Prospectus.  The

                                       -6-

consummation of the Conversion, the execution,  delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions herein contemplated have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company and the  Association  and this  Agreement has been validly  executed and delivered by the Company and the Association and is the valid, legal and binding agreement of the Company and the Association  enforceable in accordance with its terms  (except as the  enforceability  thereof  may be  limited  by  bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium,  reorganization or similar laws relating to or affecting the  enforcement  of creditors'  rights  generally or the rights of creditors of savings and loan  holding  companies,  the  accounts of whose  subsidiaries  are insured by the FDIC or by general equity  principles  regardless of whether such enforceability  is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law, and except to the  extent,  if any,  that the  provisions  of  Sections 9 and 10 hereof may be unenforceable as against public policy).

                  (l) The Company and the  Association  are not in  violation of any directive  which has been delivered to the Company or the  Association or of which management of the Company or the Association has actual knowledge from the OTS, the Commission, the FDIC or any other agency to make any material change in the  method of  conducting  their  businesses  so as to  comply in all  material respects  with all  applicable  statutes  and  regulations  (including,  without limitation,  regulations,  decisions,  directives  and  orders  of the OTS,  the Commission and the FDIC) and except as set forth in the  Registration  Statement and the Offering  Prospectus there is no suit or proceeding or, to the knowledge of the Company or the Association,  charge, investigation or action before or by any court,  regulatory  authority or governmental agency or body, pending or, to the  knowledge  of the  Company  or the  Association,  threatened,  which  might materially  and  adversely  affect  the  Conversion,  the  performance  of  this Agreement or the consummation of the  transactions  contemplated in the Plan and as described in the Registration Statement or which might result in any material adverse  change in the condition  (financial or otherwise),  earnings,  capital, properties,  business  affairs  or  business  prospects  of the  Company  or the Association or which would materially affect their properties and assets.

                  (m)  The  financial  statements  which  are  included  in  the Registration  Statement  and which are part of the  Offering  Prospectus  fairly present the financial  condition,  results of operations,  retained earnings and cash  flows of the  Association  at the  respective  dates  thereof  and for the respective  periods  covered  thereby,  and  comply  as to form in all  material respects with the applicable accounting  requirements of Title 12 of the Code of Federal  Regulations  and  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  ("GAAP") (including  those  requiring  the  recording of certain  assets at their current market value).  Such financial  statements have been prepared in accordance with generally  accepted  accounting  principles  consistently  applied  through  the periods  involved,  present  fairly in all  material  respects  the  information required to be stated therein and are consistent with the most recent  financial statements and other reports filed by the Association with the OTS and the FDIC, except  that  accounting   principles   employed  in  such  filings  conform  to requirements  of such  authorities  and not  necessarily  to generally  accepted accounting   principles.   The  other  financial,   statistical  and  pro  forma information and related notes included in the Offering Prospectus present fairly the  information  shown  therein  on a basis  consistent  with the  audited  and unaudited  financial  statements,  if any,  of the  Association  included in the Offering Prospectus,  and as to the pro forma adjustments,  the adjustments made therein have been properly applied on the basis described therein.

                  (n)  Since the  respective  dates as of which  information  is given in the Registration  Statement and the Offering Prospectus,  except as may otherwise be stated therein: (i) there has not been any material adverse change, financial or otherwise,  in the condition of the Company or the Association,  or of the Company  and the  Association  considered  as one  enterprise,  or in the earnings, capital,

                                       -7-

                  (c) The  Company  and the  Association  will  use  their  best efforts to cause any post-effective  amendment to the Registration  Statement to be declared effective by the Commission and any post-effective  amendment to the Conversion  Application  to be  approved  by the OTS and will  immediately  upon receipt of any  information  concerning  the events listed below notify  Capital Resources and promptly confirm the notice in writing:  (i) when the Registration Statement,   as  amended,  has  become  effective;   (ii)  when  the  Conversion Application,  as amended,  has been approved by the OTS; (iii) of the receipt of any comments from the Commission,  the OTS or the FDIC or any other governmental entity with respect to the Conversion or the  transactions  contemplated by this Agreement;  (iv) of the  request by the  Commission,  the OTS or the FDIC or any other  governmental  entity for any amendment or supplement to the  Registration Statement or for additional information;  (v) of the issuance by the Commission, the OTS, the FDIC or any other governmental  entity of any order or other action suspending the  Subscription or Public  Offerings or the use of the Registration Statement or the Offering  Prospectus or any other filing of the Company and the Association  under the Conversion  Regulations or other  applicable  law, or the threat of any such action;  (vi) the issuance by the Commission,  the OTS or the FDIC,  or  any  other  state  authority,   of  any  stop  order  suspending  the effectiveness  of the  Registration  Statement or of the initiation or threat of initiation  or  threat  of any  proceedings  for that  purpose;  or (vii) of the occurrence of any event  mentioned in paragraph  (h) below.

                  (d) The  Company  and the  Association  will  provide  Capital Resources and its counsel notice of its intention to file,  and reasonable  time to  review  prior to  filing  any  amendment  or  supplement  to the  Conversion Application  or the  Holding  Company  Application  and  will  not file any such amendment or supplement to which Capital  Resources shall  reasonably  object or which shall be reasonably disapproved by its counsel.

The Company authorizes Capital Resources to use the Offering  Prospectus (as amended or supplemented, if amended or supplemented) for any lawful manner in

                                      -11-

In each  jurisdiction  where any of the  Shares  shall have been qualified or registered as above  provided,  the Company will make and file such statements  and reports in each  fiscal  period as are or may be required by the laws of such jurisdiction.

                  (1)  The  favorable  opinion,  dated  as of the  Closing  Date addressed to Capital Resources and for its benefit, of Malizia,  Spidi, Sloane & Fisch, P.C., counsel for the Company and the Association dated the Closing Date, addressed to Capital Resources and in form and substance to the effect that:

                  (i) The  Company  has been duly  incorporated  and is  validly existing  as a  corporation  in good  standing  under  the laws of the  State of Delaware.

                  (ii) The Company has  corporate  power and  authority  to own, lease and operate its properties and to conduct its business as described in the Registration Statement and the Offering Prospectus; and the Company is qualified to do  business  as a  foreign  corporation  in New  York,  to the  best of such counsel's  knowledge based on the  conferences and document review  specified in item (xiii) below, the only state in which it is doing business.

                  (iii) The  Association  was a duly  organized and is a validly existing  federally-chartered  savings  and loan  association  in mutual form of organization  and upon the  Conversion  will become a duly organized and validly existing federally-chartered savings bank in capital stock form of organization, in

                                      -15-

both instances  duly  authorized to conduct its business and own its property as described in the Registration Statement; and the Association is in good standing under  the  laws  of the  United  States  and is  duly  qualified  as a  foreign corporation to transact business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which its  ownership of property or leasing of  properties or the conduct of its business  requires such  qualification  unless the failure to be so qualified in one or more such  jurisdictions  would not have a material adverse effect on the condition,  financial or  otherwise,  or the  business,  operations or income or business  prospects of the  Association.  The  activities of the  Association as described  in the  Offering  Prospectus,  insofar  as they are  material  to the operations  and  financial  condition of the  Association,  are permitted by the rules,  regulations and resolutions and practices of the OTS or the FDIC and any other federal or state authorities.

                  (iv)  The  Association  is a  member  of the  FHLBNY,  and the deposit  accounts of the  Association  are insured by the FDIC up to the maximum amount  allowed  under  law  and to the  best  of such  counsel's  knowledge  no proceedings  for the  termination or revocation of such insurance are pending or threatened;  and the description of the liquidation  account as set forth in the Registration  Statement  and the  Offering  Prospectus  under the  caption  "The Conversion - Effects of Conversion to Stock Form on Depositors  and Borrowers of the  Bank -  Liquidation  Account"  has been  reviewed  by such  counsel  and is accurate in all material respects.

                  (v)  Upon  consummation  of the  Conversion,  the  authorized, issued and outstanding  capital stock of the Company will be as set forth in the Registration   Statement   and  the  Offering   Prospectus   under  the  caption "Capitalization,"  and no shares of Common  Stock have been issued  prior to the Closing Date; at the time of the Conversion,  the Shares subscribed for pursuant to the Offerings will have been duly and validly  authorized  for issuance,  and when issued and delivered by the Company pursuant to the Plan against payment of





the consideration  calculated as set forth in the Plan, will be duly and validly issued and fully paid and non-assessable;  and the issuance of the Shares is not subject to preemptive rights.

                  (vi)  The  issuance  and  sale  of  the  common  stock  of the Association  to the  Company  have  been  duly  and  validly  authorized  by all necessary  corporate  action on the part of the Company and the Association and, upon payment  therefor in accordance  with the terms of the Plan of  Conversion, will be duly and validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and will be owned of  record  by the  Company,  free and  clear  of any  mortgage,  pledge,  lien, encumbrance or claim (legal or equitable).

                  (vii) The  execution  and delivery of this  Agreement  and the consummation of the transactions  contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized  by  all  necessary  action  on  the  part  of the  Company  and  the Association; and this Agreement is a valid and binding obligation of the Company and the  Association,  enforceable  in accordance  with its terms (except as the enforceability  thereof may be limited by  bankruptcy,  insolvency,  moratorium, reorganization  or similar laws  relating to or  affecting  the  enforcement  of creditors'  rights generally or the rights of creditors of savings  associations or savings and loan holding  companies,  the accounts of whose  subsidiaries are insured by the FDIC or by general equity principles,  regardless of whether such enforceability  is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law, and except to the  extent,  if any,  that the  provisions  of  Sections 9 and 10 hereof may be unenforceable as against public policy).

                  (viii) The Plan has been duly adopted by the required  vote of the Directors of the Company and the Association and members of the Association.

                                      -16-

                  (ix)  Subject to the  satisfaction  of the  conditions  to the OTS's approval of the  Conversion  and the Company's  application to acquire the Association, no further approval, registration,  authorization, consent or other order of any regulatory  agency,  public board or body is required in connection with the  execution and delivery of this  Agreement,  the issuance of the Shares and the  consummation  of the  Conversion,  except as may be required  under the regulations of the NASD and the NASDAQ National Market.  The Conversion has been consummated  in  all  material   respects  in  accordance  with  all  applicable provisions of the HOLA,  the Conversion  Regulations,  Federal and State law and all applicable rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

                  (x)  The   Conversion   Application   including  the  Offering Prospectus  as filed with the OTS was complete in all material  respects and has been  approved by the OTS.  The OTS has issued its order of  approval  under the savings and loan holding company provisions of the HOLA, and the purchase by the Company of all of the issued and  outstanding  capital stock of the  Association has been  authorized  by the OTS and no action has been taken,  or to  counsel's knowledge  is  pending  or  threatened,  to  revoke  any such  authorization  or approval.

                  (xi) The  Registration  Statement is effective  under the 1933 Act and no stop order  suspending  the  effectiveness  has been issued under the 1933  Act  or  proceedings   therefor  initiated  or,  to  counsel's  knowledge, threatened by the Commission.

                  (xii) At the time the  Conversion  Application,  including the Offering Prospectus contained therein, was approved,  the Conversion Application including the Offering Prospectus contained therein (as amended or supplemented, if so amended or supplemented) complied as to form in all material respects with the  requirements  of all  applicable  federal laws and the rules,  regulations, decisions  and orders of the OTS (except as to the financial  statements,  other financial data and stock valuation information included therein as to which such counsel need express no opinion); to the best of such counsel's knowledge, based on  conferences  with  management  of and the  independent  accountants  for the Company and the Association,  and on such investigation of the corporate records of the Company and the Association as such counsel  conducted in connection with the preparation of the  Registration  Statement and the Conversion  Application, all material  documents  and exhibits  required to be filed with the  Conversion Application (as amended or  supplemented,  if so amended or  supplemented)  have been so filed.  The  description in the Conversion  Application and the Offering Prospectus  contained  therein of such documents and exhibits is accurate in all material respects and fairly presents the information required to be shown.

                  (xiii)  At the time  that the  Registration  Statement  became effective,  (i) the  Registration  Statement (as amended or  supplemented  if so amended  or  supplemented)  (other  than  the  financial  statements  and  other financial and statistical data and stock valuation information included therein, as to which no opinion  need be  rendered),  complied as to form in all material respects with the  requirements of the 1933 Act and the 1933 Act Regulations and (ii) the Offering  Prospectus  (other than the  financial  statements  and other financial and  statistical  data and the stock  valuation  information  included therein,  as to which no opinion  need be  rendered)  complied as to form in all material  respects  with  the  requirements  of  the  1933  Act,  the  1933  Act Regulations,  Conversion Regulations and Federal and State law (other than state blue sky law as to which we express no opinion).  To the best of such  counsel's knowledge based on the conferences and document review  specified in item (xiii) above,  all  material  documents  and  exhibits  required  to be filed  with the Registration   Statement  (as  amended  or   supplemented,   if  so  amended  or supplemented) have been so filed. The description in the Registration  Statement and the Offering  Prospectus  of such  documents and exhibits is accurate in all





material respects and fairly

                                      -17-

presents the  information  required to be shown.  To the best of such  counsel's knowledge,  no person has sought to obtain  regulatory or judicial review of the final action of the OTS approving the Conversion Application or in approving the Holding Company Application.

                  (xiv) During the course of such  counsel's  representation  of the Company and the  Association,  nothing has come to such counsel's  attention that  caused it to believe  that (i) the Company  and the  Association  have not conducted the  Conversion,  in all material  respects,  in  accordance  with all applicable  requirements  of the Plan and applicable law, and (ii) the Plan, the Conversion  Application,  the Registration Statement and the Offering Prospectus (other than the financial  statements and other financial and  statistical  data and the stock valuation information included therein as to which no opinion need be rendered) do not comply in all material  respects with all  applicable  laws, rules,  regulations,  decisions  and orders  including,  but not limited to, the Conversion Regulations,  the HOLA, the 1933 Act and 1933 Act Regulations and all other  applicable  laws,  regulations,   decisions  and  orders,  including  all applicable  terms,  conditions,  requirements  and  provisions  precedent to the Conversion imposed upon it by the OTS, the Commission and the FDIC, if any.

                  (xv) The  terms  and  provisions  of the  Common  Stock of the Company  conform  to the  description  thereof  contained  in  the  Registration Statement  and the Offering  Prospectus,  and the form of  certificates  used to evidence the Shares are in due and proper form.

                  (xvi) To the best  knowledge  of such  counsel,  there  are no legal or governmental proceedings pending or threatened which are required to be disclosed in the Registration Statement and the Offering Prospectus,  other than those disclosed therein,  and all pending legal and governmental  proceedings to which  the  Company  or the  Association  is a party  or of  which  any of their property is the subject  which are not described in the  Registration  Statement and the Offering Prospectus, including ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business, are, considered in the aggregate, not material;  provided that for this purpose, any litigation or governmental  proceeding is not considered to be "threatened"  unless  the  potential  litigant  or  governmental  authority  has manifested  to the  management  of the  Company or the  Association,  or to such counsel, a present intention to initiate such litigation or proceeding.

                  (xvii) To the best knowledge of such counsel,  the Company and the  Association  have  obtained all  licenses,  permits and other  governmental authorizations  required for the conduct of their respective businesses,  except where the failure to have such  licenses,  permits or  authorizations  would not have a material adverse effect on the business, operations or income or business prospects of the Company and the Association, and all such licenses, permits and other governmental  authorizations are in full force and effect, and the Company and the Association are in all material respects complying therewith.

                  (xviii)   Neither  the  Company  nor  the  Association  is  in contravention of its certificate of incorporation or its charter,  respectively, or its bylaws (and the Association  will not be in  contravention of its charter or bylaws in stock form upon  consummation  of the  Conversion)  or, to the best knowledge  of such  counsel,  in  contravention  of any  obligation,  agreement, covenant or condition contained in any material contract,  indenture,  mortgage, loan  agreement,  note,  lease or other  instrument to which it is a party or by which it or its property may be bound which  contravention  would be material to the business of the Company and the  Association  considered as one  enterprise; the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the Association, the incurring of the  obligations  herein set forth and the  consummation of the transactions contemplated herein have been duly authorized by all necessary

                                      -18-

corporate action of the Company and the Association,  and, to the best knowledge of such counsel,  will not constitute a material breach of, or default under, or result in the creation or imposition of any material lien, charge or encumbrance upon any property or assets of the Company or the Association which are material to their  business  considered  as one  enterprise,  pursuant  to any  contract, indenture,  mortgage,  loan agreement,  note, lease or other instrument to which the Company or the  Association is a party or by which any of them may be bound, or to which any of the property or assets of the Company or the  Association  is subject.  In addition,  such action will not result in any  contravention of the provisions of the certificate of  incorporation  or bylaws of the Company or the Association  or any  applicable  law,  act,  regulation or order or court order, writ,  injunction or decree.  The charter of the  Association  in stock form has been approved by the OTS.

                  (xix) To the best  knowledge of such counsel,  the Company and the  Association  have good and  marketable  title to all  properties and assets described in the Registration  Statement as owned by them, free and clear of all liens,  charges,  encumbrances or restrictions,  except such as are described in the  Registration  Statement  or are not material in relation to the business of the Company and the Association considered as one enterprise; and to the best of such  counsel's  knowledge,  all of the leases  and  subleases  material  to the business  of the  Company  and the  Association  under which the Company and the





Association hold properties,  as described in the Registration Statement, are in full force and effect.

                  (xx) The Company and the  Association  are not in violation of any directive from the OTS or the FDIC to make any material change in the method of conducting  their business and the Company and the Association have conducted and are conducting their business so as to comply in all material  respects with all  applicable  statutes  and  regulations   (including,   without  limitation, regulations, decisions, directives and orders of the OTS and the FDIC).

                  (xxi)  The  information  in  the  Registration  Statement  and Offering Prospectus under the captions  "Regulation,"  "Certain  Restrictions on Acquisitions of the Company," "The  Conversion,"  "Description of Capital Stock" and the  information  in response to Items 7(d)(l),  7(f),  7(g) and 7(i) of the Form PS of the Conversion Regulations, to the extent that it constitutes matters of  law,  summaries  of  legal  matters,  documents  or  proceedings,  or  legal conclusions,  has been  reviewed by such  counsel and is correct in all material respects  (except  as to the  financial  statements  and  other  financial  data included therein as to which such counsel need express no opinion).

                  In  rendering  such  opinion,  such counsel may rely (A) as to matters  involving the  application of laws of any  jurisdiction  other than the United  States,  to the extent such counsel  deems proper and  specified in such opinion satisfactory to Capital Resources,  upon the opinion of other counsel of good  standing  (providing  that such counsel  states that Capital  Resources is justified in relying upon such  specified  opinion or  opinions),  and (B) as to matters of fact,  to the extent such counsel deems proper,  on  certificates  of responsible  officers of the Company and the  Association  and public  officials (but not on  conclusions  of law which  may be set forth in said  certificates); provided copies of any such opinion(s) or  certificates  are delivered  pursuant hereto  or to  Capital  Resources  together  with  the  opinion  to be  rendered hereunder by special  counsel to the Company and the  Association.  Such counsel may assume that any agreement is the valid and binding obligation of any parties to such agreement other than the Company or the Association.

                  (2) The  letter  of  Malizia,  Spidi,  Sloane &  Fisch,  P.C., counsel for the  Company and the  Association  addressed  to Capital  Resources, dated the Closing Date, in form and substance to the effect that:

                                      -19-

                  During the  preparation  of the  Conversion  Application,  the Registration Statement and the Offering Prospectus, such counsel participated in conferences with management of, and the independent  public  accountants for the Company  and the  Association.  Based  upon  such  conferences  and a review  of corporate  records of the Company and the Association as such counsel  conducted in connection with the preparation of the Registration  Statement and Conversion Application, nothing has come to their attention that would lead them to believe that the  Conversion  Application,  the  Registration  Statement,  the  Offering Prospectus,  or any  amendment or supplement  thereto  (other than the financial statements  and  other  financial  and  statistical  data  and  stock  valuation information  included  therein,  as to which such counsel need express no view), contained an untrue  statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements  therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

                  (3) The  favorable  opinion,  dated as of the Closing Date, of Serchuk &  Zelermyer,  LLP,  Capital  Resources'  counsel,  with respect to such matters as Capital Resources may reasonably require.  Such opinion may rely upon the opinions of counsel to the Company and the Association, and as to matters of fact,  upon  certificates  of  officers  and  directors  of the  Company and the Association  delivered  pursuant  hereto  or as such  counsel  shall  reasonably request.

                  (d) At the Closing Date,  counsel to Capital  Resources  shall have been  furnished  with such  documents  and opinions as they may  reasonably require  for the  purpose  of  enabling  them to render  the  opinion  as herein contemplated  and related  proceedings or in order to evidence the occurrence or completeness of any of the representations or warranties,  or the fulfillment of any of the conditions, herein contained.

                  (e) At the Closing  Date,  Capital  Resources  shall receive a certificate of the Chief Executive  Officer and the Chief  Financial  Officer of the Company and of the Chief Executive  Officer and Chief  Financial  Officer of the  Association,  dated as of such Closing Date,  to the effect that:  (i) they have carefully  examined the Offering  Prospectus and, in their opinion,  at the time the  Offering  Prospectus  became  authorized  for final use,  the Offering Prospectus  did not contain an untrue  statement  of a material  fact or omit to state a material  fact  necessary in order to make the  statements  therein,  in light of the  circumstances  under which they were made,  not  misleading;  (ii) since the date the Offering Prospectus became authorized for final use, in their opinion no event has  occurred  which should have been set forth in an amendment or  supplement  to the  Offering  Prospectus  which  has not been so set  forth, including specifically,  but without limitation,  any material adverse change in the condition,  financial or otherwise, or in the earnings, capital, properties, business  prospects or business affairs of the Company or the  Association,  and the conditions set forth in this Section 8 have been satisfied;  (iii) since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration  Statement and the Offering  Prospectus,  there has been no material  adverse change in the condition,  financial or  otherwise,  or in the earnings,  capital,  properties, business  affairs or  business  prospects  of the  Company  or the  Association,





independently,  or  of  the  Company  and  the  Association  considered  as  one enterprise,  whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business;  (iv) to the best  knowledge  of such  officers the  representations  and  warranties  in Section  4 are true  and  correct  with the same  force  and  effect  as  though expressly  made  at and  as of  the  Closing  Date;  (v)  the  Company  and  the Association  have complied with all material  agreements and  satisfied,  in all material  respects at or prior to the Closing Date, all obligations  required to be met by  such  date  and  will  in  all  material  respects  comply  with  all obligations  to be  satisfied  by them  after  Conversion;  (vi)  no stop  order suspending the  effectiveness of the  Registration  Statement has been initiated or, to the best  knowledge  of the  Company or  Association,  threatened  by the Commission or any state authority; (vii) no order suspending the Subscription or Public Offerings, the Conversion, the

                                      -20-

acquisition  of all of the  shares  of the  Association  by the  Company  or the effectiveness  of the  Offering  Prospectus  has  been  issued  and to the  best knowledge of the Company or  Association,  no proceedings  for that purpose have been initiated or threatened by the OTS, the Commission,  the FDIC, or any state authority;  and (viii) to the best of their  knowledge,  no person has sought to obtain review of the final action of the OTS approving the Plan.

                  (f) Prior to and at the Closing  Date:  (i) in the  reasonable opinion of Capital  Resources,  there shall have been no material adverse change in the condition,  financial or otherwise,  or in the earnings,  or the business affairs or business  prospects of the Company or the Association  independently, or of the Company or the  Association,  considered as one enterprise,  since the latest dates as of which such condition is set forth in the Offering Prospectus, except  as  referred  to  therein;  (ii)  there  shall  have  been  no  material transaction  entered into by the Company or the Association from the latest date as of which the  financial  condition of the Company or the  Association  is set forth  in  the  Offering  Prospectus  other  than  transactions  referred  to or contemplated  therein;  (iii)  the  Company  or the  Association  shall not have received  from the OTS or the FDIC any  direction  (oral or written) to make any material change in the method of conducting their business with which it has not complied  (which  direction,  if any,  shall  have  been  disclosed  to  Capital Resources) and which would reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse effect on the  business,  operations  or  financial  condition  or income of the Company or the  Association  taken as a whole;  (iv) neither the Company nor the Association  shall have been in default (nor shall an event have occurred which, with  notice or lapse of time or both,  would  constitute  a default)  under any provision of and  agreement or instrument  relating to any material  outstanding indebtedness;  (v) no action, suit or proceedings, at law or in equity or before or by any federal or state  commission,  board or other  administrative  agency, shall be  pending,  or, to the  knowledge  of the  Company  or the  Association, threatened  against the Company or the  Association  or  affecting  any of their properties wherein an unfavorable  decision,  ruling or finding would reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse  effect on the business,  operations, financial  condition  or income of the  Company or the  Association,  taken as a whole;  and (vi) the Shares have been  qualified or registered  for offering and sale  under the  securities  or blue sky laws of the  jurisdictions  as  Capital Resources shall have requested and as agreed to by the Company.

                  (g) Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Capital Resources shall receive a letter from KPMG,  dated the date hereof and addressed to Capital  Resources:  (i) confirming that KPMG is a firm of independent public accountants  within the meaning of the 1933 Act and the 1933 Act Regulations and 12 C.F.R. ss. 571.2(c)(3) and no information concerning its relationship with or interests in the Company and the  Association is required to be disclosed in the Offering Prospectus by the Conversion Regulations or Item 10 of the Registration Statement, and stating in effect that in KPMG's opinion the financial statements of the Association as are included in the Offering  Prospectus comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the 1933 Act and the related published rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder and the Conversion  Regulations and generally  accepted  accounting  principles; (ii) stating in effect that, on the basis of certain agreed upon procedures (but not  an  audit  examination  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  auditing standards)  consisting of a reading of the latest  available  unaudited  interim financial statements of the Association  prepared by the Association,  a reading of the  minutes of the  meetings  of the Board of  Directors  and members of the Association and consultations  with officers of the Association  responsible for financial and accounting  matters,  nothing came to their attention which caused them to  believe  that:  (A)  such  unaudited  financial  statements  are not in conformity  with generally  accepted  accounting  principles  applied on a basis substantially  consistent with that of the audited financial statements included in the Offering Prospectus; or (B) during the period from the date of the latest financial statements included in the

                                      -21-

Offering  Prospectus to a specified  date not more than five business days prior to the date hereof,  there has been (1) an increase of greater than  $500,000 in the long term debt of the  Association or (2) an increase of $100,000 or more in loans past due 90 days or more as of the last day of the month immediately prior to such  specified  date or (3) an  increase  of $100,000 or more in real estate acquired by  foreclosure  or (4) a decrease of $50,000 or more in the  allowance for loan losses or (5) any decrease in total retained earnings or (6) a decrease





in net  income  when  compared  to the like  period in 1995 or (7) any change in total assets of the Association in an amount greater than  $2,000,000  excluding proceeds  from stock  subscriptions;  and (iii) stating that, in addition to the audit examination referred to in its opinion included in the Offering Prospectus and  the  performance  of the  procedures  referred  to in  clause  (ii) of this subsection  (g), they have compared with the general  accounting  records of the Company and/or the Association, as applicable, which are subject to the internal controls of the Company and/or the Association, as applicable, accounting system and other data prepared by the Company  and/or the  Association,  as applicable, directly from such accounting  records,  to the extent specified in such letter, such amounts and/or percentages set forth in the Offering  Prospectus as Capital Resources  may  reasonably  request;  and  they  have  found  such  amounts  and percentages to be in agreement therewith (subject to rounding).

                  (h) At the Closing  Date,  Capital  Resources  shall receive a letter  from KPMG,  dated the  Closing  Date,  addressed  to Capital  Resources, confirming  the  statements  made by its  letter  delivered  by it  pursuant  to subsection (g) of this Section 8, except that the  "specified  date" referred to in clause (ii)(B) thereof to be a date specified in such letter, which shall not be more than three business days prior to the Closing Date.

                  (i) The Company and the  Association  shall not have sustained since  the date of the  latest  audited  financial  statements  included  in the Registration Statement and Offering Prospectus any loss or interference with its business from fire, explosion,  flood or other calamity,  whether or not covered by insurance,  or from any labor dispute or court or governmental  action, order or  decree,  otherwise  than as set forth or  contemplated  in the  Registration Statement and Offering  Prospectus,  and since the respective  dates as of which information  is given in the  Registration  Statement  and Offering  Prospectus, there  shall  not have  been any  material  change  in the long term debt of the Company or the Association  other than debt incurred in relation to the purchase of Shares by the Company's  Tax-Qualified  Employee Plans, or any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the general affairs, management, financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company or the  Association,  otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Registration Statement and Offering Prospectus,  the effect of which, in any such  case  described  above,  is  in  Capital  Resources'  reasonable  judgment sufficiently  material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the  Subscription or Public Offerings or the delivery of the Shares on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Offering Prospectus.

                  (j) At or prior to the Closing Date,  Capital  Resources shall receive  (i) a copy  of the  letter  from  the  OTS  authorizing  the use of the Offering Prospectus,  (ii) a copy of the order from the Commission declaring the Registration  Statement  effective,  (iii) a copy of a certificate  from the OTS evidencing  the good  standing of the  Association,  (iv)  certificates  of good standing from the States of Delaware and New York  evidencing  the good standing of the  Company  and from the State of New York  evidencing  that the Company is duly qualified to do business and in good standing in New York and (v) a copy of the letter from the OTS approving the Company's Holding Company Application.

                  (k)      As soon as available after the Closing Date, Capital Resources shall receive a

                                      -22-

certified copy of the Association's stock charter.

                  (1)  Subsequent  to the  date  hereof,  there  shall  not have occurred any of the  following:  (i) a suspension  or  limitation  in trading in securities  generally on the New York Stock  Exchange or American Stock Exchange or in the over-the-counter  market, or quotations halted generally on the NASDAQ National  Market,  or minimum or maximum  prices for  trading  being  fixed,  or maximum  ranges for  prices  for  securities  being  required  by either of such exchanges or the NASD or by order of the  Commission  or any other  governmental authority;  (ii) a general  moratorium on the operations of commercial  banks or federal  savings banks or general  moratorium on the withdrawal of deposits from commercial  banks or federal  savings banks  declared by either federal or state authorities; (iii) the engagement by the United States in hostilities which have resulted  in the  declaration,  on or  after  the  date  hereof,  of a  national emergency  or war;  or (iv) a  material  decline  in the price of equity or debt securities  if, as to clauses (iii) or (iv),  the effect of such  hostilities or decline, in Capital Resources'  reasonable  judgment,  makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the Subscription or Public Offerings or the delivery of the Shares on the terms and in the manner  contemplated  in the  Registration Statement and the Offering Prospectus.

                  All such opinions, certifications, letters and documents shall be in compliance with the provisions  hereof only if they are, in the reasonable opinion of Capital Resources and its counsel,  satisfactory to Capital Resources and its  counsel.  Any  certificates  signed by an  officer or  director  of the Company or the  Association  and  delivered to Capital  Resources or its counsel shall be deemed a representation  and warranty by the Company or the Association to Capital Resources as to the statements made therein.

                  If any of the  conditions  specified in this Section shall not have been fulfilled when and as required by this  Agreement,  this Agreement and all of Capital  Resources'  obligations  hereunder  may be  canceled  by Capital Resources by notifying the  Association  of such  cancellation  in writing or by telegram at any time at or prior to the Closing Date, and any such  cancellation shall be without  liability  of any party to any other party except as otherwise provided in Sections 2, 7, 9 and 10 hereof.  Notwithstanding  the above, if this





Agreement  is  canceled  pursuant  to  this  paragraph,   the  Company  and  the Association  jointly and severally agree to reimburse  Capital Resources for all out-of-pocket  expenses,  (including without limitation the fees and expenses of Capital Resources' counsel) reasonably incurred by Capital Resources and Capital Resources'  counsel at its normal rates,  in connection  with the preparation of the Registration Statement and the Offering Prospectus,  and in contemplation of the proposed  Subscription  or Public  Offerings  to the extent  provided for in Sections 2 and 7 hereof.

                  SECTION 9.  Indemnification.

                  (a) The Company  and the  Association  jointly  and  severally agree to indemnify and hold harmless Capital Resources, its officers, directors, agents and  employees  and each person,  if any, who controls or is under common control with Capital  Resources within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20(a) of the 1934 Act,  against any and all loss,  liability,  claim, damage or expense whatsoever (including but not limited to settlement expenses), joint or several,  that Capital  Resources or any of them may suffer or to which Capital  Resources  and any such persons  upon  written  demand for any expenses (including fees and  disbursements of counsel)  incurred by Capital Resources or any of them  in  connection  with  investigating,  preparing  or  defending  any actions,  proceedings or claims (whether  commenced or threatened) to the extent such losses,  claims,  damages,  liabilities  or actions (i) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material

                                      -23-

fact  contained in the  Registration  Statement  (or any amendment or supplement thereto),  preliminary  or  final  Offering  Prospectus  (or  any  amendment  or supplement thereto),  the Conversion  Application or any Blue Sky application or other  instrument  or document of the Company or the  Association  or based upon written  information  supplied  by the Company or the  Association  filed in any state or  jurisdiction  to  register  or qualify any or all of the Shares or the subscription  rights  applicable  thereto  under  the  securities  laws  thereof (collectively,  the  "Blue  Sky  Application"),  or  any  application  or  other document,  advertisement, oral statement, or communication ("Sales Information") prepared,  made or executed  by or on behalf of the Company  with its consent or based upon written or oral information  furnished by or on behalf of the Company or the Association, whether or not filed in any jurisdiction in order to qualify or register the Shares under the securities  laws thereof;  (ii) arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state in any of the foregoing documents  or  information,  a material  fact  required to be stated  therein or necessary to make the statements  therein,  in light of the circumstances  under which  they were  made,  not  misleading;  or,  (iii)  arise  from any theory of liability  whatsoever relating to or arising from or based upon the Registration Statement  (or any  amendment  or  supplement  thereto),  preliminary  or  final Offering  Prospectus  (or any amendment or supplement  thereto),  the Conversion Application,   any  Blue  Sky   Application   or  Sales   Information  or  other documentation distributed in connection with the Conversion;  provided, however, that no  indemnification is required under this paragraph (a) to the extent such losses, claims,  damages,  liabilities or actions arise out of or are based upon any untrue  material  statements or alleged  untrue  material  statements in, or material omission or alleged material omission from, the Registration  Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the Conversion  Application,  any Blue Sky Application,  the preliminary or final Offering Prospectus (or any amendment or  supplement  thereto),  or Sales  Information  made in  reliance  upon and in conformity with written information  furnished to the Company or the Association by Capital Resources  regarding  Capital  Resources  expressly for use under the caption "The Conversion - Marketing Arrangements" in the Offering Prospectus nor is  indemnification  required for material  oral  misstatements  made by Capital Resources,  which are not based upon information  provided by the Association or the  Company  orally or in  writing  or based on  information  contained  in the Registration Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto),  preliminary or final  Offering  Prospectus  (or  any  amendment  or  supplement  thereto),  the Conversion   Application,   any  Blue  Sky  Application  or  Sales   Information distributed in connection with the Conversion.

                  (b) Capital  Resources  agrees to indemnify  and hold harmless the Company and the Association,  their directors and officers, agents, servants and  employees  and  each  person,  if any,  who  controls  the  Company  or the Association within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20(a) of the 1934 Act  against  any and all loss,  liability,  claim,  damage or  expense whatsoever (including but not limited to settlement expenses),  joint or several which they,  or any of them,  may suffer or to which they,  or any of them,  may become subject under all applicable federal and state laws or otherwise,  and to promptly  reimburse  the  Company,  the  Association  and any such  persons upon written demand for any expenses  (including fees and  disbursements  of counsel) incurred by them, or any of them, in connection with investigating, preparing or defending any actions,  proceedings or claims (whether  commenced or threatened) to the extent such losses, claims, damages,  liabilities or actions arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact  contained in the  Registration  Statement  (or any amendment of supplement thereto),  or the preliminary or final Offering  Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto),  or the Conversion  Application or any Blue Sky Application or Sales Information or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state in any of the foregoing  documents a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements  therein,  in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,  not  misleading;  provided,  however,  that Capital Resources  obligations  under this  Section 9(b) shall exist only if and only to the

                                      -24-





extent that such untrue  statement or alleged  untrue  statement was made in, or such material fact or alleged  material fact was omitted from, the  Registration Statement (or any amendment or supplement  thereto),  the  preliminary  or final Offering Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto),  or the Conversion Application,  any Blue Sky Application or Sales Information in reliance upon and in  conformity  with  written  information  furnished  to  the  Company  or  the Association by Capital Resources  regarding Capital Resources  expressly for use under the caption  "The  Conversion  - Marketing  Arrangements"  in the Offering Prospectus  or in the event of oral  misstatements  made by  Capital  Resources, which are not based upon information  provided by the Association or the Company orally or in  writing  or based on  information  contained  in the  Registration Statement  (or any  amendment  or  supplement  thereto),  preliminary  or  final Offering  Prospectus  (or any amendment or supplement  thereto),  the Conversion Application,  any  Blue Sky  Application  or Sales  Information  distributed  in connection with the Conversion.

                  (c) Each indemnified party shall give prompt written notice to each indemnifying party of any action,  proceeding,  claim (whether commenced or threatened),  or suit instituted against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought  hereunder,  but  failure to so notify an  indemnifying  party  shall not relieve it from any liability  which it may have on account of this Section 9 or otherwise.  An  indemnifying  party may  participate  at its own  expense in the defense of such action.  In addition,  if it so elects within a reasonable  time after  receipt of such notice,  an  indemnifying  party,  jointly with any other indemnifying  parties  receiving such notice,  may assume defense of such action with  counsel  chosen by it and  approved by the  indemnified  parties  that are defendants in such action,  unless such indemnified parties reasonably object to such assumption on the ground that there may be legal defenses available to them that are different from or in addition to those  available to such  indemnifying party.  If an  indemnifying  party  assumes  the  defense  of such  action,  the indemnifying  parties  shall not be liable for any fees and  expenses of counsel for the indemnified  parties incurred thereafter in connection with such action, proceeding or claim,  other than reasonable costs of investigation.  In no event shall the indemnifying  parties be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one  separate  firm of  attorneys  (and any special  counsel  that said firm may retain)  for  all  indemnified  parties  in  connection  with  any  one  action, proceeding or claim or separate but similar or related  actions,  proceedings or claims in the same jurisdiction  arising out of the same general  allegations or circumstances.

                  (d) The agreements  contained in this Section 9 and in Section 10  hereof  and  the  representations  and  warranties  of the  Company  and the Association set forth in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of: (i) any investigation  made by or on behalf of Capital Resources or its officers, directors or controlling persons, agents or employees or by or on behalf of the Company or the Association or any officers,  directors or controlling persons, agents or employees of the Company or the Association or any controlling  person,  director or officer of the Company or the Association; (ii) delivery of and payment  hereunder for the Shares; or (iii) any termination of this Agreement.

                  (e) No  indemnification  by the Association under Section 9(a) hereof nor  contribution  under Section 10 hereof shall be effective if the same shall be deemed to be in violation of any law, rule or regulation  applicable to the  Association  including,  without  limitation,  Section  23A of the  Federal Reserve Act. If the  indemnification  or  contribution by the Association is not effective  pursuant  to the  preceding  sentence,  then the  indemnification  by Capital  Resources  pursuant to Section 9(b) shall be given only to the Company, its  directors  and  officers,  agents,  servants and  employees  and not to the Association,  its directors and officers, agents, servants and employees and the Association  shall not be entitled to any  contribution  from Capital  Resources pursuant to Section 10.

                                      -25-

                  SECTION  10.  Contribution.  In order to provide  for just and equitable  contribution in circumstances in which the  indemnification  provided for in  Section 9 is due in  accordance  with its  terms  but is for any  reason unavailable  as a result of  Section  9(e) or held by a court to be  unavailable from the  Company,  the  Association  or Capital  Resources,  the  Company,  the Association  and Capital  Resources  shall  contribute to the aggregate  losses, claims,  damages and liabilities  (including any investigation,  legal and other expenses  incurred in connection  with, and any amount paid in settlement of any action,  suit or  proceeding  of any claims  asserted,  but after  deducting any contribution  received by the Company or the  Association  or Capital  Resources from  persons  other than the other  party  thereto,  who may also be liable for contribution)  in such  proportion so that Capital  Resources is responsible for that  portion  represented  by the  percentage  that  the fees  paid to  Capital Resources pursuant to Section 2 of this Agreement (not including expenses) bears to the gross proceeds received by the Company from the sale of the Shares in the Subscription and Public  Offerings and the Company and the Association  shall be responsible for the balance.  If, however,  the allocation provided above is not permitted  by  applicable  law or if the  indemnified  party  failed to give the notice  required  under  Section 9 above,  then each  indemnifying  party  shall contribute  to such  amount  paid or payable by such  indemnified  party in such proportion  as is  appropriate  to reflect not only such  relative  fault of the Company and the  Association on the one hand and Capital  Resources on the other





in connection  with the  statements or omissions  which resulted in such losses, claims,  damages or  liabilities  (or actions,  proceedings or claims in respect thereof), but also the relative benefits received by the Company and Association on the one hand and Capital  Resources on the other from the offering as well as any other relevant equitable  considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company and the  Association  on the one hand and Capital  Resources  on the other shall be deemed to be in the same  proportion as the total gross  proceeds from the Subscription and Public Offerings (before deducting  expenses) received by the  Company  bear to the total fees (not  including  expenses)  received  by Capital Resources. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things,  whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the  omission  or  alleged  omission  to state a  material  fact  relates  to information  supplied by the Company  and/or the  Association on the one hand or Capital  Resources on the other and the parties'  relative  intent,  good faith, knowledge,  access to  information  and  opportunity  to correct or prevent such statement or omission.  The Company, the Association and Capital Resources agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 10 were  determined by pro rata  allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 10. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified  party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or action,  proceedings or claims in  respect  thereof)  referred  to above in this  Section 10 shall be deemed to include any legal or other  expenses  reasonably  incurred  by such  indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action,  proceeding or claim. It is expressly agreed that Capital  Resources shall not be liable for any loss,  liability,  claim, damage or expense or be required to contribute any amount which in the aggregate  exceeds the amount paid  (excluding  reimbursable expenses) to Capital  Resources under this Agreement.  It is understood that the above-stated  limitation on Capital Resources' liability is essential to Capital Resources and that Capital  Resources  relied upon such limitation and would not have entered into this  Agreement if such  limitation  had not been agreed to by the  parties  to this  Agreement.  No  person  found  guilty  of any  fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled  to  contribution  from any  person  who was not  found  guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Company and the Association under this Section 10 and under  Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company and the  Association  may otherwise have. For purposes of this Section 10,  each of Capital  Resources',  the  Company's  or the  Association's officers and directors and each person,  if any, who controls Capital  Resources or the  Company or the  Association  within the  meaning of the 1933 Act and the 1934 Act shall  have the same  rights to  contribution  as the  Company  and the Association.

                                      -26-

Any  party  entitled  to  contribution,  promptly  after  receipt  of  notice of commencement  of any action,  suit,  claim or  proceeding  against such party in respect of which a claim for  contribution  may be made  against  another  party under this  Section 10, will  notify  such party from whom  contribution  may be sought,  but the  omission  to so notify  such party shall not relieve the party from whom  contribution  may be sought  from any  other  obligation  it may have hereunder or otherwise than under this Section 10.

                  SECTION  11.  Survival  of  Agreements,   Representations  and Indemnities.  The respective  indemnities of the Company,  the  Association  and Capital Resources and the representations and warranties and other statements of the Company and the  Association set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement shall  remain  in full  force  and  effect,  regardless  of any  termination  or cancellation  of this  Agreement  or any  investigation  made by or on behalf of Capital  Resources,  the Company,  the  Association  or any  indemnified  person referred to in Section 9 hereof,  and shall  survive the issuance of the Shares, and any legal  representative,  successor  or assign of Capital  Resources,  the Association, and any such indemnified person shall be entitled to the benefit of the respective agreements, indemnities, warranties and representations.

                  SECTION 12.  Termination.  Capital Resources may terminate  this Agreement by giving the notice indicated below in this Section at any time after this Agreement becomes effective as follows:

                  (a) In the event the  Company  fails to sell all of the Shares within the period  specified,  and in accordance with the provisions of the Plan or as required by the Conversion  Regulations and applicable law, this Agreement shall terminate upon refund by the Association to each person who has subscribed for or ordered any of the Shares the full amount which it may have received from such person, together with interest as provided in the Offering Prospectus,  and no party to this  Agreement  shall have any  obligation to the other  hereunder, except  for  payment  by the  Association  and/or  the  Company  as set forth in Sections 2, 7, 9 and 10 hereof.

                  (b) If any of the conditions  specified in Section 8 shall not have been  fulfilled when and as required by this  Agreement,  or by the Closing Date,  or waived in writing  by Capital  Resources,  this  Agreement  and all of Capital Resources  obligations hereunder may be canceled by Capital Resources by notifying the Association of such  cancellation in writing or by telegram at any time at or prior to the  Closing  Date,  and,  any  such  cancellation  shall be without  Liability of any party to any other party except as otherwise  provided in Sections 2, 7, 9 and 10 hereof.

                  (c) If Capital Resources elects to terminate this Agreement as provided in this section,  the Company and the Association  shall be notified as provided in Section 13 hereof,  promptly by Capital  Resources  by  telephone or telegram, confirmed by letter.
