THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF SUPPLIER UNDER, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE EQUAL TO THE LESSER OF: (i) ***; AND (ii) ***. THE FOREGOING EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY: (A) EVEN IF SUPPLIER HAS BEEN ADVISED, OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE, OF THE POSSIBILITY OF LOSSES OR DAMAGES; (B) EVEN IF ANY REMEDY IN THIS AGREEMENT FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE; AND (C) REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OR BASIS OF LIABILITY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIABILITY). Indemnification. Reseller shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Supplier and its employees, officers, directors, suppliers, and successors from and against any third-party claim, suit, proceeding, damages, losses and/or liability arising from or related to (i) Reseller's breach of any provision of this Agreement; and/or (ii) Reseller's interaction and/or relationship with any Customer and/or End User or other third party. Term and Termination This Agreement shall become effective on the Effective Date and shall remain in effect for an initial period of 1 year ("Initial Term"). Thereafter, this Agreement shall automatically be renewed for successive 1-year terms (each a "Renewal Term", and together with the Initial Term, the "Term"). Following the Initial Term, either Party may terminate this Agreement without cause upon written notice to the other Party of at least 3 months. Without derogating from any other remedies that any Party may have under the terms of this Agreement or at law, each Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement forthwith upon the occurrence of any of the following: (i) the other Party is in material breach of its obligations hereunder and fails to remedy such breach within 30 days after being requested in writing to do so; or (ii) the other Party's bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, whether voluntarily or otherwise, or if it makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors. Upon any termination of this Agreement: (i) all rights granted by Supplier to Reseller under the Agreement revert to Supplier; (ii) Reseller shall transfer to Supplier all data, reports and any other information generated by Reseller in the course of performance of this Agreement; and (iii) any payment obligation which had accrued or become payable prior to the date of termination (including the payment obligation under Section 4.2) shall survive termination of this Agreement. Upon termination of this Agreement, the provisions in Sections 1, 6.5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.3, 12.4, 13 (but solely to the extent stated in the last sentence of that section), and 14 shall remain in effect as necessary to carry out the purpose of those Sections after termination. In addition to the foregoing, if, at the time of termination of this Agreement, Reseller shall have additional Product units in its inventory and is able to sell them to Customers and/or End Users (including, without limitation, any Product units for which Reseller has or is obligated to pay the Supplier the purchase price therefor but which have not yet been delivered to the Reseller by Supplier, which Supplier hereby agrees to either deliver as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement as if it had not terminated or to refund the purchase price therefor), then the licenses and appointments described in Section 2 shall remain in effect with respect to such unsold Product units (and such Section 2 shall not terminate) until the earlier of (i) the date on which the last Product in Reseller's inventory is sold to a Customer and/or End User, or (ii) 1 year from the date of the termination of this Agreement. ***. General Supplier and/or Reseller may assign or novate this Agreement and the rights and obligations under it to any of its affiliates or upon any merger or acquisition or the sale of all or substantially all of its assets relating to the Agreement. Any purported assignment of rights in violation of this subsection is void. The relationship between the Parties is that of supplier and purchaser. Reseller is an independent contractor and is not the legal representative, agent, joint venture, partner, or employee of Supplier. Reseller may describe itself as Supplier's 'authorized distributor', but may not hold itself out as the Supplier's agent. Reseller has no authority to assume or create any obligations of any kind or to make any representations or warranties, whether express or implied, on behalf of the Supplier, nor to bind the Supplier in any respect.

Except as to the timely payment by Reseller for the Products purchased under this Agreement, no failure or omission to carry out or observe any provision of this Agreement shall give rise to any claim by one Party against the other, or be a breach of this Agreement, if the same is caused by or arises out of circumstances beyond the reasonable control of the other Party, including technical difficulties beyond such Party's reasonable control that delay or prevent manufacture ("Force Majeure"). However, the Parties shall endeavor to avoid, remove, or cure all such conditions as soon as is reasonably feasible. If either Party is prevented or hindered from carrying out its obligations under this Agreement due to a Force Majeure, this Agreement shall be suspended as long as the Force Majeure persists. If such period exceeds 1 month, either Party may terminate this Agreement on giving written notice to the other. No failure or delay on the part of either Party to exercise any right or remedy under this Agreement shall be construed or operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right or remedy preclude the further exercise of such right or remedy. If any provision or part of any provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the other provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect as if the Agreement had been executed without that provision or part. All notices or other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be given in person, by courier or by registered mail (provided that written confirmation of receipt is provided) addressed as set forth in the heading of this Agreement or such other address as any Party may designate to the other in accordance with this procedure. All communications delivered in person or by courier service shall be deemed to have been received upon delivery, shall be deemed to have been received on the business day following transmission with confirmed answer back, and all notices and other communications sent by registered mail shall be deemed to have been received within 3 business days after posting. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York and all disputes and controversies arising out of or in connection with the Agreement shall be brought exclusively before the competent courts in New York County, New York; provided however that judgment shall be enforceable in any country and that nothing in this Section shall prevent or restrict either Party from seeking interim relief in any competent jurisdiction as it may deem fit. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the Supplier and the Reseller. All previous or contemporaneous agreements, proposals, understandings, and communications between the Supplier and the Reseller are replaced in their entirety by this Agreement. In entering into this Agreement, neither Party has relied on any warranties, representations, or other matters other than as set out in this Agreement. All conditions, warranties, or other terms implied by statute or common law are excluded to the fullest extent permitted by law. This Agreement may be amended only by a written instrument executed by authorized representatives of the Parties. Each of Reseller and Supplier will, respectively, ensure that it and its employees, agents or affiliates, or by any independent contractors on its behalf or for its benefit, shall comply with the United States' Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (15 U.S.C. §§ 78dd-1 et seq.) and any analogous anti-bribery and anti-corruption law, rule, regulation that may apply to any of the transactions contemplated under this Agreement, including but not limited to in connection with the sale, resale, import, export, transportation, or shipment of the Products.
