Collectible Concepts Group, Inc. ("CCGI") and Pivotal Self Service Tech, Inc. ("PVSS"), (the "Parties" or "Joint Venturers" if referred to collectively, or the "Party" or Joint Venturer" if referred to singularly), by this Agreement associate themselves as business associates, and not as partners, in the formation of a joint venture (the "Joint Venture"), for the purpose of engaging generally in the business provided for by terms and provisions of this Agreement.

1.   Name of the Joint Venture. The name of the Joint Venture will be MightyCell      Batteries, and may sometimes be referred to as "MightyCell" or the "Joint      Venture" in this Agreement. The principal office and place of business      shall be located in 1600 Lower State Road, Doylestown, PA 18901.

2.   Scope of the Joint Venture Business. The Joint Venture is formed for the      purpose of engaging generally in the business of marketing batteries and      related products, (the "Products") that include the display of licensed      logos, images, brand names and other labels that differentiate them from      the branding (the "PVSS Products") under which PVSS and/or its affiliates,      sell to retailers and distributors in the normal course of their business.      Without in any way limiting the generality of the foregoing, the business      of the Joint Venture shall include:

          (a)  The purchase of Products for resale;           (b)  The acquisition of a license(s) permitting the use of selected                images in the Products;           (c)  The sale and distribution of the Products to retailers and                distributors; and,           (d)  The transaction of such other and further business as is                necessary, advisable, or incidental to the business of the Joint                Venture.           (e)  Develop a global marketing program for licensed Products

     Exhibit A attached hereto, describes by way of example but not limitation      the responsibilities of the Joint Venturers

3.   Capital Contributions. Except as agreed upon by mutual consent, the Joint      Venturers shall not be required to make any capital contribution to the      Joint Venture.

4.   Offices of the Joint Venture. The principal place of business of the Joint      Venture shall be at 1600 Lower State Road, in the City of Doylestown, Bucks      County, Pennsylvania, but may maintain such other offices as the Joint      Venturers may deem advisable at any other place or places within or without      the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

5.   Powers and Authority of the Joint Venturers. The Joint Venturers shall have      full and complete charge of all affairs of the Joint Venture. The Joint      Venturers recognize that both of the Joint Venturers are and will continue      to be engaged in the conduct of their respective businesses for their own      account. Neither Joint Venturer shall be entitled to compensation for      services rendered to the Joint Venture as such, but each Joint Venturer      shall be reimbursed for all direct expenses, including travel, office, and      all other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in the operation of the affairs      of the Joint Venture and the promotion of its businesses.

     It is agreed that either Joint Venturer shall, except as provided for      below, have authority to execute instruments of any character relating to      the affairs of the Joint Venture; provided, that without the written      consent or approval of both of the Joint Venturers: (i) the Joint Venture      shall incur no liability of any sort, nor any indebtedness for borrowed      funds; (ii) no assets owned in the name of the Joint Venture be disposed      of; and (iii) no commitment to purchase any item for the Joint Venture      shall be made.

6.   Division of Income and Losses. All income and credits, and all losses and      deductions shall be owned and shared among the Joint Venturers as follows:

     50% to Collectible Concepts Group, Inc.

     50% to Pivotal Self Service Tech, Inc.

     Depreciation and all other charges and expenses, which are not expressly      apportioned by this Agreement, shall be apportioned in accordance with      generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied.

7.   Accounting Provisions. The Joint Venturers shall maintain adequate books      and records to be kept of all the Joint Venture activities and affairs      conducted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. All direct costs and      expenses, which shall include any insurance costs in connection with the      distribution of the Products or operations of the Joint Venture, or if the      business of the Joint Venture requires additional office facilities than      those now presently maintained by each Joint Venturer, such item shall be





     paid by the Joint Venture. The fiscal year of the Joint Venture shall be      the calendar year, and shall use the cash basis of accounting. If requested      by a Joint Venturer, the Joint Venture books and records shall be audited      as of the close of each year by an independent accountant acceptable to      both Joint Venturers. All books and records of every kind and character, of      the Joint Venture, and other information, shall be kept at the principal      office of the Joint Venture, or at such other place or places as may be      agreed upon by the Joint Venturers, and shall be fully available to each      Joint Venturer or his duly authorized representative, all at reasonable      times. The books of the Joint Venture shall represent the complete record      and report of business operations, including a balance sheet and income and      expense statements reflecting all receipts and disbursements of the Joint      Venture, and such reports shall be submitted to the Joint Venturers on a      regular basis.

8.   Term of Joint Venture. The Joint Venture shall commence on the 1st of      March, 2003, and shall be effective until February 28, 2004 unless extended      by written agreement of the Joint Venturers not less than thirty (30) days      prior to scheduled termination.

9.   Distributions. During the term of the Joint Venture, no interest shall be      allowed to any Joint Venturer upon the amount of his contribution. No Joint      Venturer shall withdraw, transfer or have paid to him in any manner any      part of his capital contribution or account, or any other funds or property      of the Joint Venture without the consent of both Joint Venturers; provided,      however, there may be distributed to the Joint Venturers, from time to      time, so much of the gross income of the Joint Venture as shall not be      needed to defray the necessary and expected costs and expenses of the Joint      Venture business. Distributions may only be made if after any distribution      is made, the Joint Venture assets are in excess of all liabilities of the      Joint Venture. Each distribution shall be made ratably to the Joint      Venturers according to their prorata interest in the Joint Venture as shown      in Section 6.

10.  Internal Revenue Code Election. The Joint Venturers agree and declare that      this association for the carrying on of a joint venture business operation      does not, and is not intended to create a partnership, for either legal or      United States income tax purposes, each Party recognizing that the other is      willing and able to contribute capital, labor, and services for the      operation of a successful joint venture business. Further, each Party      elects under the authority of Section 761(a) of the Internal Revenue Code      of 1986 (the "Code"), as amended and all successor statutes, to be excluded      from the application of all of the provisions of Subchapter K of Chapter 1      of the Subtitle A of the Code, and the Parties agree that the election out      of Subchapter K of Chapter 1 of Subtitle A of the Code shall, if necessary,      be manifested by their execution and filing of all appropriate      documentation. The Parties also declare that they are not making any      agreement to undertake any business other than that set forth in this      Agreement; and nothing in this Agreement is to be construed as a limitation      of the powers or rights of either Party to carry on his separate business      for his sole benefit; provided, however, the Parties shall cooperate with      each other according to the terms and spirit of this Agreement in the      performance of their joint venture business operation.

11.  Procedure on Termination and Liquidation. On any termination of the Joint      Venture, its debt shall be paid or provided for in a manner satisfactory to      the Joint Venturers. Then, any unexpended portion of Joint Venture funds      shall be distributed to the Joint Venturers in accordance with their      prorata ownership in the Joint Venture and all other assets of the Joint      Venture shall be distributed as undivided interests to the Joint Venturers      ratably according to their prorata interests in the Joint Venture as set      forth in Section 6. If any asset is not capable of being distributed on an      undivided basis, the Parties shall agree on a price for such asset and it      shall be distributed to one Party and a corresponding balance, in cash or      property, shall be made of the Joint Venture assets so that each Party      receives his proportionate share of all the Joint Venture assets.

12.  Sale or Purchase of Interest of Joint Venturer Prohibited. No Joint      Venturer shall be authorized or empowered to mortgage, hypothecate, pledge,      sell, or transfer, an interest in the Joint Venture, nor confer on any      successor or assignee the right to become a Joint Venturer without the      consent of the other Joint Venturer.

13.  Notice. Any notice which a Joint Venturer shall have occasion to give to      the other Joint Venturer shall be deemed sufficient notice for all purposes      as to its contents if given in writing, hand delivered, by fax, or prepaid      mail, to the address of such Joint Venturer as set out below his signature.

14.  Construction. The Joint Venturers declare that in entering into this      Agreement, they have contracted with reference to the laws of the      Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and the construction and interpretation of      the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall be interpreted and      construed under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, except in      such cases and to such extent as the laws of another jurisdiction shall      necessarily control.

15.  Benefit. This Agreement shall be binding on the Joint Venturers and their      respective heirs, successors, executors, administrators, and assigns.

16.  Counterparts. This Agreement may be signed in counterparts and shall be      deemed one original instrument.
