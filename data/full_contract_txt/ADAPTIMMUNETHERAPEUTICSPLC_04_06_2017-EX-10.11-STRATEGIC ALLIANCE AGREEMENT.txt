  Study specific documents ("Study Orders") as agreed upon by the Parties. This Agreement shall apply to all Studies set out in the Study Orders performed by MD Anderson and the MD Anderson principal investigator(s) responsible for the performance of such Studies ("Principal Investigator(s)") upon execution of Study Orders during the term of this Agreement. Each Study Order shall be substantially in the form attached as Exhibit III to this Agreement and shall detail the specifics of the Study to be performed under such Study Order including, without limitation, (i) the detailed Protocol or workscope, (ii) the Principal Investigator and (iii) identify any project-specific resources or support provided by Adaptimmune. In the event of any conflict of terms of this Agreement and the terms of a Study Order, the terms of this Agreement shall govern, unless the Study Order specifically and expressly supersedes this Agreement with respect to a specific term, and then only with respect to the particular Study Order and specific term. If there is any discrepancy or conflict between the terms contained in a Protocol or workscope and this Agreement and/or the relevant Study Order, the terms of the Protocol or workscope shall govern and control with respect to clinical/scientific matters and the terms of the Agreement and/or the relevant Study Order in that order shall govern and control with respect to all other matters, e.g., legal and financial matters.   1.3 Adaptimmune agrees to commit funding in an amount of at least nineteen million six hundred and forty four thousand Dollars US ($19,644,000) for the performance of the Studies as set out in Exhibit I during the term ("Alliance Funding"). The JSC may allocate and/or re-allocate funds to Studies as necessary and agreed by JSC. The basic per patient estimate for Clinical Studies is as follows: for screening Clinical Studies: $***, for long term follow-up Clinical Studies: $*** and for other Clinical Studies: $***. If the Parties extend the term by mutual agreement as set forth herein, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith the amount of future Study funding commitments by Adaptimmune applicable to such extended term. In the event a Study is terminated early, then in relation to any funds allocated to such Study, the Parties shall promptly discuss and agree upon a replacement of that Study with a new study of similar scope that is of mutual scientific interest to the Parties and that is approved by the JSC, and that will be funded by the Alliance Funding. If there is any Alliance Funding at the expiration or termination of this Agreement, it will be allocated to studies, research or tests agreed by the JSC, and such Alliance Funding will be payable in accordance with agreed milestones relevant to such agreed studies, research or tests.   The Parties understand that the compensation being paid to MD Anderson under this Agreement constitutes the fair market value of the services to be provided hereunder. Neither MD Anderson nor Principal Investigator shall seek or accept reimbursement from any third-party payor for any Study items or procedures supplied by or paid for by Adaptimmune under this Agreement. MD Anderson acknowledges that Adaptimmune may be obligated to disclose all payments made hereunder, including the provision of non-monetary items of value, as may be required under Applicable Law, including the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, passed as Section 6002 of the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and, to the extent required by Applicable Laws, agrees to keep and maintain relevant records of such and, upon Adaptimmune's reasonable request, provide such records to Adaptimmune to the extent such information is not already in Adaptimmune's possession, but only to the extent required for Adaptimmune to comply with its legally required reporting obligations. MD Anderson consents to such disclosure, to the extent such disclosure is required for Adaptimmune to comply with Applicable Laws. MD Anderson shall ensure that the Principal Investigator provides in a timely manner all such reasonable information to Adaptimmune necessary for Adaptimmune to comply with any disclosure requirements to the extent required by and in accordance with 21 C.F.R.

  No amounts paid under this Agreement are intended to be for, nor shall they be construed as, an offer or payment made in exchange for any explicit or implicit agreement to purchase, prescribe, recommend, or provide a favorable formulary status, for any Adaptimmune product or service. Any such compensation will be consistent with fair market value in arms-length transactions and will not be determined in a manner that takes into account the volume or value of any referrals or business otherwise generated between the Parties for which payment may be made in whole or in part under Medicare, Medicaid or other Federal health care programs. MD Anderson and Adaptimmune each confirm that in entering into this Agreement they have not accepted any bribes or illegal inducements to enter into this Agreement or to perform any Study and will not accept any bribe or illegal inducement or offer any bribe or illegal inducement in the performance of or for the performance of any Study whether during or after the termination or expiry of this Agreement.     1.4 The nineteen million six hundred and forty four thousand Dollars US ($19,644,000) for the Studies shall be due and payable to MD Anderson according to the schedule outlined in Table 2 in Exhibit II. The JSC retains the right to prioritize and replace Studies as necessary subject to Section 1.6.   1.5 The Parties will establish a Joint Steering Committee ("JSC") of equal representation, comprised of three (3) representatives (employees, directors or consultants who are subject to appropriate confidentiality obligations) from each Party, with the representatives of each Party collectively having one vote on all matters to be decided upon by the JSC. Each Party can appoint and replace its representatives in the JSC at its own discretion through timely written notice to the other Party.   1.6 The JSC will have meetings (either in person, by teleconference or via electronic means) at least quarterly. At least one meeting per year will be conducted in person or by videoconference (including the kick-off meeting). The JSC will decide on matters by unanimous vote with each of MD Anderson and Adaptimmune exercising one vote each provided, however, that no action may lawfully be taken at any meeting unless at least two representatives of each Party (including for this purpose any proxy representative appointed as provided below) are present at the meeting.  If a member of the JSC is unable to attend a meeting, he or she may appoint, in writing, a proxy to participate and vote in his or her stead. Decisions may also be made by electronic mail, provided such electronic mail is provided by at least two representatives from Adaptimmune and MD Anderson and such electronic mail is acknowledged to be received by the recipient. Although decision will be made by mutual agreement of the JSC, in the event of any disagreement, ***           .   1.7 The main task of the JSC will be to oversee the Alliance. In order to achieve the objectives of the Alliance, the JSC will oversee each Study under the Alliance. The JSC will provide technical, scientific, clinical, and regulatory guidance to the Studies and will be responsible for monitoring progress of these Studies. Additional representatives can be invited by the JSC on a case by case basis should discussion of certain topics require so, provided that such guests will be subject to an obligation of confidentiality and non-use at least as strict as Section 5 below. In the event a Study is terminated early or does not initiate, the Parties shall promptly replace that Study with a new study similar in scope that is of mutual scientific interest to the Parties. Once agreed by the JSC, such replacement study will be funded by the Alliance Funding and payable in accordance with agreed milestones for such replacement study.

  contest and avoid such disclosure, and provided, further, that receiving Party will disclose only that portion of such Confidential Information that it is legally required to disclose.   5.4 For the purposes of this Section 5, any combination of features disclosed to the receiving Party will not be deemed to be within the foregoing exceptions merely because individual features are. Moreover, specific disclosures made to the receiving Party will not be deemed to be within the foregoing exceptions merely because they are embraced by general disclosures.   5.5 All Confidential Information disclosed to receiving Party pursuant to this Agreement will be and remain the disclosing Party's property. Nothing contained herein will be construed as granting to receiving Party any proprietary right on or in relation to any part of or the whole of the Confidential Information, or any right to use any of the Confidential Information except for the Purpose. Receiving Party will return to disclosing Party all documents and other materials which constitute Confidential Information, as well as all copies thereof, promptly upon request or upon termination of this Agreement (whichever is earlier); provided, however, that receiving Party may keep one copy of the Confidential Information received under this Agreement in its secure files in accordance with the terms of this Agreement for the sole purpose of maintaining a record of the Confidential Information received hereunder and for compliance with this Agreement and/or Applicable Laws.   5.6 Adaptimmune will not require MD Anderson to disclose any Protected Health Information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Adaptimmune comes into knowledge or possession of any "Protected Health Information" (as such term is defined under HIPAA) by or through MD Anderson or any information that could be used to identify any Study subject or other MD Anderson patients or research subjects, Adaptimmune will maintain any such Protected Health Information or other information confidential in accordance with laws and regulations as applicable to MD Anderson, including without limitation HIPAA, will use any such Protected Health Information solely to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws, the IRB and the Consent/Authorization of the patient/research subject, and will not use or disclose any such Protected Health Information or other information in any manner that would constitute a violation of any Applicable Laws or regulation if such use or disclosure was made by MD Anderson. It is intended that MD Anderson will not disclose any Protected Health Information to Adaptimmune under this Agreement.   5.7 Improper use or disclosure of the Confidential Information by receiving Party is likely to cause substantial harm to disclosing Party. Therefore, in the event of a breach, threatened breach, or intended breach of this Agreement by receiving Party, in addition to any other rights and remedies available to it at law or in equity, disclosing Party will be entitled to seek preliminary and final injunctions enjoining and restraining such breach, threatened breach, or intended breach.   6.

  Proprietary Material as set forth in Section 3.3 above. "Background IP" means all intellectual property (including rights in Confidential Information) of a Party that: (a) was generated by such Party before the Effective Date; (b) is generated by such Party outside the scope or after expiration of this Agreement or any Study under this Agreement; and in each such case; (c) is owned by such Party, either partially or wholly, or is licensed to, or otherwise controlled by such Party, and which is not an Invention under this Agreement.   7.2 Patient records, research notebooks, all original source documents, Protected Health Information (as such term is defined by HIPAA), MD Anderson's business records, regulatory and compliance documents, original medical records or any information required to be maintained by MD Anderson in accordance with Applicable Laws, that is generated in the conduct of the Studies (collectively, "MD Anderson Records") will be owned by MD Anderson. All results, data and work product (excluding MD Anderson Records) generated in the conduct of the Studies ("Data") shall be owned by Adaptimmune Limited. MD Anderson shall maintain all such Data as confidential, subject to the publication rights granted in Section 12 below. Data will be promptly disclosed by MD Anderson to Adaptimmune in the form of a Study report or as otherwise reasonably requested by Adaptimmune. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, MD Anderson shall have the right to use results and Data of the Study for its internal research, academic, and patient care purposes and for publication in accordance with Section 12 below, save that no right or license is granted to MD Anderson under any of Adaptimmune's Background IP. Adaptimmune shall promptly disclose any Data it generates to MD Anderson.   7.3 MD Anderson will provide to Adaptimmune a detailed written disclosure of each patentable invention and/or discovery (and all intellectual property rights therein) conceived and reduced to practice in the conduct of a Study and arising from the performance of a Study ("Invention") promptly after a written invention disclosure report for such Invention is received by MD Anderson's Office of Technology Commercialization.   7.4 Inventions shall be owned by the Parties in accordance with the following: (a) ***               "Adaptimmune Inventions" shall be the sole property of Adaptimmune Limited.   (b) With respect to any Inventions that are not Adaptimmune Inventions ("Other Inventions"), where made solely by MD Anderson or its employees and agents, such Inventions will be solely owned by MD Anderson; where made jointly by MD Anderson and Adaptimmune and/or Adaptimmune Limited and their employees and agents will be jointly owned by MD Anderson and Adaptimmune Limited. Inventions that are made solely by Adaptimmune, Adaptimmune Limited or its employees and agents will be solely owned by Adaptimmune Limited. Inventorship will be determined in accordance with United States patent law.   7.5  MD Anderson hereby grants Adaptimmune and Adaptimmune Limited a non-exclusive, worldwide, irrevocable royalty-free license to any Invention in which MD Anderson has an ownership interest, for any purpose. Such license shall include an unrestricted right to sublicense through multiple tiers. MD Anderson also hereby grants to Adaptimmune Limited an exclusive option to negotiate an

  exclusive (subject to MD Anderson's perpetual, irrevocable, no-cost right to use such Invention for non-commercial internal research, academic and patient care purposes), royalty-bearing license to any Invention in which MD Anderson has an ownership interest, provided that Adaptimmune Limited pays all reasonably incurred patent expenses for such Invention in the event Adaptimmune Limited exercises its option. Adaptimmune Limited must exercise its option to negotiate a license to any Invention by notifying MD Anderson in writing within six months' of MD Anderson disclosing such Invention to Adaptimmune (the "Option Period").  If Adaptimmune Limited fails to timely exercise its option within the Option Period with respect to any Invention, Adaptimmune Limited's right to negotiate a license agreement with respect to such Invention will automatically terminate, and MD Anderson will be free to negotiate and enter into a license with any other party. If Adaptimmune Limited timely exercises its option, the terms of the license shall be negotiated in good faith within six months of the date such option is exercised, or within such time the parties may mutually agree in writing (the "Negotiation Period"). If, however, Adaptimmune Limited timely exercises its option, but MD Anderson and Adaptimmune Limited are unable to agree upon the terms of the license during the Negotiation Period, Adaptimmune Limited's right to exclusively license such Invention will terminate, and MD Anderson will be free to enter into a license with any other party (subject to the grant of the non-exclusive license above).   7.6. Adaptimmune Limited hereby grants MD Anderson a perpetual, irrevocable, no-cost, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to any Adaptimmune Invention or Other Invention in which Adaptimmune Limited has an ownership interest for MD Anderson's internal non-commercial research, academic and patient care purposes. For clarity the grant of any license under any Invention or assignment of any Invention by either Party does not include any license under any of such Party's Background IP, even where such Background IP dominates or encompasses any Invention.   7.7 As between the Parties, the sole owner of any Invention will have the sole right to prepare, file, prosecute, maintain, enforce and defend all U.S. and foreign patents, registrations and other forms of intellectual property in such Invention but nothing herein will obligate the owner to take any such actions. As between the Parties, Adaptimmune will have the first right to prepare, file, prosecute, maintain, enforce and defend all U.S. and foreign patents, registrations and other forms of intellectual property in any jointly-owned Invention using patent counsel of its choice that is subject to the written approval of MD Anderson not to be unreasonably withheld and at the sole cost and expense of Adaptimmune, with accounting to MD Anderson.  Adaptimmune will keep MD Anderson reasonably informed of all such material preparations, filings, material prosecution, material maintenance, material enforcement and defense and will consider MD Anderson's recommendations in good faith (provided such recommendations are provided on a timely basis) If Adaptimmune elects not to file in the United States or not to maintain an application or patent arising from any jointly-owned Invention, Adaptimmune will promptly notify MD Anderson within reasonable time for MD Anderson to file, prosecute or maintain such application or patent, and MD Anderson will have the right to file, prosecute or maintain such application or patent, at MD Anderson's expense. MD Anderson will keep Adaptimmune reasonably informed of all such material preparations, material filings, material prosecution, material maintenance, material enforcement and defense it makes in relation to any jointly-owned Invention. The Parties will reasonably cooperate with each other with respect to matters concerning jointly-owned Inventions to the extent reasonably necessary for filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending or enforcing any such patents, registrations and other forms of intellectual property protection. MD Anderson will keep Adaptimmune reasonably informed of any material filings, material prosecution, enforcement and defense patents, new patent applications, material registrations or other forms of intellectual property covering Other Inventions.   7.8 ***

            .   8. Term and Termination   8.1 The term of this Agreement shall be five (5) years following the Effective Date or until the Studies are completed, whichever is later,  unless extended or unless terminated earlier in accordance with the provisions hereof.  In the event of expiration or early termination of this Agreement, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall remain binding with respect to any ongoing Studies (including any new studies to which any remaining Alliance Funding is allocated under Section 1.3) until completion of the Studies or termination of the respective Study Order/s.   8.2 A Party will have the right to terminate this Agreement if the other Party commits a material breach of the Agreement and fails to cure such breach within thirty (30) days of receiving notice from the non-breaching Party of such breach.  Any expiration or termination of this Agreement will not affect any then existing Study Orders, and any then outstanding Study Orders will continue after the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement in accordance with their respective provisions. Upon any expiration or termination of this Agreement, provisions of this Agreement that are incorporated by reference into any then outstanding Study Orders will survive termination of this Agreement and will continue to apply to such Study Orders until termination or expiration of each such Study Orders in effect at the time this Agreement expires or is terminated.   8.3 A Party may terminate a Study Order: (a) if the other Party commits a material breach of this Agreement or the Study Order and fails to cure such breach within thirty (30) days of receiving notice from the non-breaching Party of such breach; or (b) in the case of any Clinical Studies, due to health and safety concerns related to the Study Drug or procedures in the Study (including regulatory holds due to the health and safety of the Study Subjects); or (c) in the case of MD Anderson and in relation to any Clinical Studies, where IRB requests termination of any Study; or (d) in the case of Adaptimmune, *** set out in Section 1.2 above. The Parties agree that any termination of a Study Order shall allow for: (i) the wind down of the Study to ensure the safety of Study subjects; and (ii) Adaptimmune's final reconciliation of Data related to the Study in addition to Adaptimmune's final monitoring visit. All reasonable fees associated with the wind-down activities and final monitoring visit shall be paid by Adaptimmune, to the extent not covered by Alliance Funding. Termination of one or more Study Orders will not automatically result in the termination of this Agreement or termination of any other Study Orders. Upon termination of a Study Order, MD Anderson will immediately return (at Adaptimmune's cost) any Study Drugs provided by Adaptimmune for such Study as directed by Adaptimmune.   8.4 In case any regulatory or legal authorization necessary for the conduct of the Study is (i) finally rejected or (ii) withdrawn, the relevant Study Order shall terminate automatically at the date of receipt of such final rejection. Termination or cancellation of this Agreement or a Study Order will not affect the rights and obligations of the Parties that have accrued prior to termination, and any provisions of this Agreement or a particular Study Order that by their nature extend beyond expiration or termination will survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement and/or that particular Study Order. In particular, the provisions of Sections 2-13 as applicable will survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement.

  8.5 In the event the Parties cannot reach agreement on a new Principal Investigator pursuant to Section 14.1 or such new Principal Investigator does not agree to the terms of this Agreement and the relevant Study Order, either Party may terminate such Study Order upon notice to the other Party.   8.6 In addition, in order to accommodate the review and approval of this Agreement by the Office of General Counsel of UT System (the "OGC"), for a period of *** (***) days following the Effective Date (the "Limited Unilateral Termination Period"), MD Anderson will have the right to terminate this Agreement without cause upon ten (10) days' notice to Adaptimmune; provided, however, that (i) a termination by MD Anderson will be effective if notice of termination is sent by MD Anderson any time within the Limited Unilateral Termination Period even if the ten day notice period extends beyond the Limited Unilateral Termination Period and (ii) the Limited Unilateral Termination Period will expire on the earlier to occur of (x) the end of the sixty days, or (y) written notice to Adaptimmune from MD Anderson that the Agreement has been approved by the OGC. Should MD Anderson terminate this Agreement in accordance with this Section 8.6 then the Parties will use reasonable efforts to ensure that any Clinical Study in relation to which any patient has been screened or enrolled shall continue under a separate clinical trial agreement to be entered into between the Parties as soon as possible after receipt of notice of termination by Adaptimmune. The terms of such clinical trial agreement shall be in substantially similar form to terms agreed for other clinical trial agreements between the Parties and a separate budget shall be agreed pursuant to such clinical trial agreement.   8.7 For each Study, Adaptimmune shall make all payments due for Study performance reasonably incurred or obligated in good faith hereunder which have accrued up to the date of termination of a Study Order or this Agreement, or, in case of a termination of this Agreement or the relevant Study Order pursuant to Section 8.4, up to the date of receipt of such final rejection.   9. Indemnification   9.1 Adaptimmune and Adaptimmune Limited agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless MD Anderson, System, each Principal Investigator and its/their Regents, trustees, directors, officers, staff, employees, students, faculty members, and its/their affiliates and contracted clients and other parties as may be listed on a Study Order ("Indemnified Party/ies"): (a) from and against any and all liability, claims, lawsuits, losses, demands, damages, costs, and expenses as a result of third party claims or judgments ("Indemnified Losses") resulting from (i) personal injury (including death) to any person or damage to property to the extent arising from the design or manufacture of the Study Drug, and (ii) the use of the Data or results of the Study by or on behalf of Adaptimmune, Adaptimmune Limited or any Joint Research Partner and (iii) Adaptimmune's or Adaptimmune Limited's negligence in connection with a Study or this Agreement; (b) from and against any Indemnified Losses arising from an injury to a Study subject caused by the Study Drug or any procedure required by the Protocol.

  EXHIBIT IV   45





  DRAFT RELEASE   MD Anderson Cancer Center and Adaptimmune Form Strategic Alliance to Advance Development of Immunotherapies Targeting Multiple Cancers   PHILADELPHIA, and HOUSTON, U.S.A. and OXFORD, UK, September XX, 2016 — Adaptimmune Therapeutics plc (Nasdaq: ADAP), a leader in T-cell therapy to treat cancer, and The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center announced today that they have entered into a multi-year strategic alliance designed to expedite the development of novel adoptive T-cell therapies for multiple types of cancer.   The alliance pairs MD Anderson's preclinical and clinical teams with Adaptimmune's scientists and proprietary SPEAR® (Specific Peptide Enhanced Affinity Receptor) T-cell technology platform, which enables Adaptimmune to identify targets expressed on solid and hematologic cancers and to develop affinity enhanced T-cell receptors (TCRs) with optimal potency and specificity against them.   The teams will collaborate in a number of areas including preclinical and clinical development of Adaptimmune's SPEAR T-cell therapies targeting MAGE-A10 and future clinical stage first and second generation SPEAR T-cell therapies such as MAGE-A4 across a number of cancers, including bladder, lung, ovarian, head and neck, melanoma, esophageal and gastric cancers. The alliance will also drive research and development of other new SPEAR TCR therapies to targets in other tumor types such as breast cancers and facilitate clinical study participation by MD Anderson in other Adaptimmune trials. Access to MD Anderson's tumor repository will guide further target selection and clinical trial design, while its cancer immunology cores and expertise in performing translational medicine studies may help optimize the efficacy and safety of SPEAR T-cell therapies.   "At MD Anderson, we are focused on providing the best possible care for cancer patients, including implementing important new technologies and treatment modalities," said Elizabeth Mittendorf, M.D., Ph.D., associate professor of Breast Surgical Oncology.   David Hong, M.D., associate professor of Investigational Cancer Therapeutics at MD Anderson added, "It is our hope this alliance will allow us to address numerous solid tumors and augment the patient's immune system, directing it against tumors based on their specific molecular makeup."   "We believe that this strategic alliance will provide a strong partnership for the development of multiple new first and subsequent generation SPEAR T-cell therapies against many intractable solid tumors in our near-term clinical programs," commented Rafael Amado, Adaptimmune's chief medical officer. "It will also generate invaluable data from patient samples that will help us understand these therapies and design the next generation of studies. We are very proud to form this alliance with the outstanding team of cancer immunologists at MD Anderson, and are confident that together we can move these novel immunotherapeutic candidates forward for patients who are fighting a variety of cancers."   About MD Anderson   The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston ranks as one of the world's most respected centers focused on cancer patient care, research, education and prevention. The institution's sole mission is to end cancer for patients and their families around the world. MD Anderson is one of only 45 comprehensive cancer centers designated by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). MD Anderson is ranked No.1 for cancer care in U.S. News & World Report's "Best Hospitals" survey. It has ranked as one of the nation's top two hospitals since the survey began in 1990, and has ranked first for nine of the   46





  past 10 years. MD Anderson receives a cancer center support grant from the NCI of the National Institutes of Health (P30 CA016672).   About Adaptimmune   Adaptimmune is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on novel cancer immunotherapy products based on its SPEAR® (Specific Peptide Enhanced Affinity Receptor) T-cell platform. Established in 2008, the company aims to utilize the body's own machinery - the T-cell - to target and destroy cancer cells by using engineered, increased affinity TCRs as a means of strengthening natural patient T-cell responses. Adaptimmune's lead program is a SPEAR T-cell therapy targeting the NY-ESO cancer antigen. Its NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell therapy has demonstrated signs of efficacy and tolerability in Phase 1/2 trials in solid tumors and in hematologic cancer types, including synovial sarcoma and multiple myeloma. Adaptimmune has a strategic collaboration and licensing agreement with GlaxoSmithKline for the development and commercialization of the NY-ESO TCR program. In addition, Adaptimmune has a number of proprietary programs. These include SPEAR T-cell therapies targeting the MAGE-A10 and AFP cancer antigens, which both have open INDs, and a further SPEAR T-cell therapy targeting the MAGE-A4 cancer antigen that is in pre-clinical phase with IND acceptance targeted for 2017. The company has identified over 30 intracellular target peptides preferentially expressed in cancer cells and is currently progressing 12 through unpartnered research programs. Adaptimmune has over 250 employees and is located in Oxfordshire, U.K. and Philadelphia, USA.
