Theravance will provide two (2) Theravance New Compounds to the collaboration within eighteen (18) months of the Effective Date in order to meet the requirement that Theravance contribute a total of four (4) LABA compounds to the Pooled Compounds. Without prejudice to the foregoing, GSK will endeavor to provide Theravance, upon Theravance's request and at GSK's expense and discretion, such assistance as may be reasonably required by Theravance to achieve this objective, including providing directly or through GSK's vendors, assistance in (i) chemical process development, (ii) salt selection, (iii) pharmaceutical formulation, (iv) toxicological evaluation, and (v) API preparation.   4.2 Obligations for Development.   4.2.1 General; GSK. Under the direction of the Joint Project Committee, specific Pooled Compounds will be identified from time to time and, as applicable, selected for Development as a Collaboration Product. The Joint Project Committee will determine the number and extent of Development of the Pooled Compounds and the criteria to be used for selecting among the eight Pooled Compounds and, subject to the other terms of this Agreement, will endeavor to move one or more such Collaboration Products forward in Development. In   17





  relation to the foregoing, GSK shall have the overall responsibility for, and use Diligent Efforts in, the performance of all such Development activities which shall include, where applicable, relevant regulatory filings (as contemplated under Article 8) for any such Collaboration Product moved forward in Development. Further, GSK shall use Diligent Efforts to advance such Collaboration Product through Development in accordance with the Go/No-Go checkpoints identified in the then current Development Plan for such Collaboration Product. GSK shall also use Diligent Efforts to contribute at least one ICS and/or other non-LABA compound to the collaboration for the purpose of developing a combination product and Diligent Efforts to develop an optimal inhaled formulation of Collaboration Product in a device which may be either/or a dry powder inhaler formulation and/or a metered dose inhaler formulation of the Collaboration Compound and Development activities of such may continue in parallel.   4.2.2 GSK Funding Responsibility. GSK shall bear all costs and expenses associated with the Development of Collaboration Products for Commercialization including those incurred by Theravance (or to which it has become obligated) after the signature date of this Agreement and which previously have been discussed with and agreed to by GSK and, so far as the aforementioned Theravance costs are concerned, for the avoidance of doubt, the maximum amount shall not exceed U.S. $2,940,000.   4.2.3 Decisions with Respect to Products.   (a) GSK shall have the sole discretion with respect to Development decisions for Collaboration Products subject to and in accordance with Sections 3.1.5, 3.2.5, and 4.3 .   (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties acknowledge that Theravance is about to initiate a Phase I Study in two parts, on TD-3327. The initiation of this study will be approved via the Joint Project Committee in accordance with all other Development activities. Theravance shall be responsible for the routine monitoring of this study and will transfer remaining clinical development responsibility for TD-3327 to the Joint Project Committee on completion of the TD-3327 Phase Ia and Phase Ib Studies.   (c) GSK shall provide the Joint Project Committee with an update report within thirty days of (i) the initiation (i.e., first person dosed) of any Study involving a Collaboration Product, and (ii) the last person dosed/last visit in any Study relating to a Collaboration Product. GSK will provide the Joint Project Committee with a reasonably detailed "top line results" report within sixty days following the last person dosed/last visit in any Study involving a Collaboration Product.   4.2.4 Development Timelines. It is hereby acknowledged that GSK's strategic objective is to move one or more of the Collaboration Products into Development at the earliest opportunity. GSK will consult with the Joint Project Committee and will share, modify and further develop all applicable Development Plans and timelines in that forum. It is recognised that success can be optimised by pursuing a number of Collaboration Products through various phases of clinical Development up to the point of Technical or Commercial Failure, and/or until the first Collaboration Product for both single agent and combination therapy achieves regulatory agency approval. At a strategic level, GSK is committed to this objective. However, at an operational level it is recognised that internal and external resources will be constrained from time to time, resulting in the need to prioritise individual studies and activities relating to Collaboration Products. GSK will use Diligent Efforts to secure the necessary resource and will keep the Joint Project Committee informed on the progress of individual studies and activities relating to Collaboration Products as part of any changes to Development Plans and timelines.   18





  The current objective of the Collaboration is to achieve Marketing Authorization Approval in the US and other Major Markets for a Collaboration Product from one of the eight Pooled Compounds which can be used as a single agent and/or in combination with other therapeutically active components (including but not limited to a Long Acting Inhaled Corticosteroid) for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of one or more respiratory diseases by end 2009 for the single agent and 2010 for the first combination product and Development Plans and timelines will be developed and/or refined in an effort to achieve this objective.   4.3 Replacement Compounds. If within two years after the Effective Date, the Development of Collaboration Products containing any two of the Pooled Compounds contributed by a Party is discontinued due to Technical Failure, it will be the option of the Party who contributed the discontinued compounds to discover and offer up to the collaboration two Replacement Compounds as replacements for the discontinued compounds within twelve months following the discontinuation of the second failed compound. For the avoidance of doubt, any such new compound that satisfies the Criteria will automatically be accepted as a Pooled Compound in place of the relevant Party's discontinued compound, subject to Joint Steering Committee approval pursuant to Section 3.1.3(f). Nothing in the foregoing shall preclude either Party from having the option of offering up a Replacement Compound for a Pooled Compound at any time during the period referred to in Section 14.5 (subject to the Criteria being met and Joint Steering Committee approval pursuant to Section 3.1.3(f)).   4.4 Transfer of Data. As soon as practicable but in no event more than thirty (30) days after the Effective Date, the Parties shall determine what data and materials relating to TD-3327 and AMI-15471 are necessary for GSK's Development obligations pursuant to this Article 4, including any technology transfer required for API Compound manufacturing activities contemplated by Article 9, and establish a process for transferring copies of such data and material to GSK (including, to the extent available, in appropriate electronic format) or provide means of access thereto reasonably acceptable to GSK.   4.5 LABA Activity Inside and Outside of the Collaboration.   4.5.1 The intent of the Parties in respect of the Pooled Compounds is that such Pooled Compounds remain exclusive to this Collaboration and, subject to Sections 4.5.2 — 4.5.4 and Article 14 below, no activity in respect of such Pooled Compounds shall be permitted outside of this Agreement.   4.5.2 Subject to Article 14 and to Section 4.5.4, if prior to First Commercial Sale of a GSK Initially Pooled Compound or a GSK Replacement Compound, Development of such compound is discontinued under this Agreement ("GSK Discontinued Compound"), all rights in respect of such GSK Discontinued Compound shall revert in full to GSK and such GSK Discontinued Compound shall automatically fall outside of this Agreement except that (i) GSK shall thereafter be prohibited from carrying out any further clinical Development work or clinical activity in respect of such GSK Discontinued Compound inside the Field for at least four (4) years after the termination of this Agreement, and (ii) for the avoidance of doubt, GSK shall pay to Theravance a royalty on Net Sales of any such GSK Discontinued Compound in accordance with Section 14.9.   4.5.3 Subject to Article 14 and Section 4.5.4, if prior to First Commercial Sale of a Theravance Compound, Development of such compound is discontinued under this Agreement ("Theravance Discontinued Compound"), all rights in respect of such Theravance Discontinued Compound shall revert in full to Theravance and such Theravance Discontinued Compound shall   19





  automatically fall outside of this Agreement except that (i) Theravance thereafter shall be prohibited from carrying out any further clinical Development work or clinical activity in respect of such Theravance Discontinued Compound inside the Field until after the termination of this Agreement, and (ii) for the avoidance of doubt, Theravance shall pay to GSK a royalty on Net Sales of any such Theravance Discontinued Compound in accordance with Section 14.9.   4.5.4 Notwithstanding Sections 4.5.2 and 4.5.3, for so long as there is one Collaboration Product being Developed under this Agreement, neither Party shall carry out clinical Development inside the Field with any Long Acting B2 Adrenoceptor Agonist that is not a Pooled Compound under this Agreement; provided, however, that this restriction shall not apply to any compound or product (including new product line extensions and/or re-formulation work) where the original compound or product is, as of the date of signature of this Agreement, already Commercialized.   ARTICLE 5 COMMERCIALIZATION   5.1 Global Marketing Plans.   5.1.1 General.

ARTICLE 6 FINANCIAL PROVISIONS   6.1 Signing Payment; Equity Investment; One-Time Fee.   6.1.1 Signing Payment. In partial consideration for the acquisition of license rights under the Theravance Patents and the Theravance Know-How by GSK under this Agreement, GSK shall on the Effective Date, pay to Theravance a non-creditable, non-refundable amount of Ten Million United States Dollars (U.S. $10,000,000).   6.1.2 Stock Purchase. On the Effective Date, GSK will purchase 4,000,000 shares of Theravance Series E Preferred Stock at a price of U.S.$10.00 per share for total consideration of Forty Million United States Dollars (U.S. $40,000,000). Such purchase will be made pursuant to the Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement attached hereto as Schedule 6.1.2.   6.1.3 One-Time Fee for AMI-15471. Within thirty days following receipt by GSK of Theravance's written notification of the decision by Theravance to nominate AMI-15471 as a "development candidate," and in further partial consideration for the acquisition of license rights under the Theravance Patents and the Theravance Know-How by GSK under this Agreement, GSK shall pay to Theravance a non-creditable, non-refundable amount of Five Million United States Dollars (U.S.$5,000,000). AMI-15471 will be declared a development candidate when Theravance (a) completes a study demonstrating lack of activity in the hERG assay (as per the Criteria in Schedule 1.19), and (b) establishes AMI- 15471 in a stable crystalline form.   21





  6.1.4 One-Time Fee for Each Theravance New Compound. Within thirty days following the acceptance by the Joint Project Committee or the Joint Steering Committee of each of the two Theravance New Compounds to be contributed to the collaboration pursuant to Section 4.1, and in further partial consideration for the acquisition of license rights under the Theravance Patents and the Theravance Know-How by GSK under this Agreement, GSK shall pay to Theravance a non-creditable, non-refundable amount of Five Million United States Dollars (U.S.$5,000,000) for each such Theravance New Compound.   6.2 Milestone Payments.   6.2.1 General. In further consideration of the covenants and agreements contained herein, the Parties shall also pay to each other the payments set forth below for each such Development milestone referred to therein (each, a "Development Milestone"); provided always that each such payment shall be made only one time for each Collaboration Product regardless of how many times such Development Milestones are achieved for such Collaboration Product, and no payment shall be owed for a Development Milestone which is not reached (except that, upon achievement of a Development Milestone for a particular Collaboration Product, any previous Development Milestone for that Collaboration Product for which payment was not made shall be deemed achieved and payment therefore shall be made); provided further that, in the event that more than one Development Milestone is achieved with respect to the same Collaboration Product at one time, then all applicable payments under Section 6.2 shall be made. For example, if TD-3327 as a single-agent Collaboration Product and a LABA/ICS Combination Product that contains TD- 3327 are approved in the same Marketing Authorization Approval, then in addition to the relevant milestone for the single-agent TD-3327 Collaboration Product, the relevant milestone for the LABA/ICS Combination Product shall be paid simultaneously. In the event of termination of development of a particular Collaboration Product and an alternative Collaboration Product replaces such Terminated Collaboration Product then milestone payments for such replacement compound shall not be paid in respect of milestones already achieved by the Terminated Collaboration Product. For example, if development of TD-3327 is terminated and TD-3327 is replaced by a another Collaboration Product which contains a Theravance compound, milestone payments for such replacement compound will only commence for milestones achieved that have not already been achieved by TD-3327.   6.2.2 GSK to Theravance. GSK shall make the following milestone payments to Theravance upon the achievement of the indicated Development Milestone for the first Collaboration Product in which the Long-Acting β2 Adrenoceptor Agonist is a Theravance Compound, and for the first LABA/ICS Combination Product in which the Long-Acting β2 Adrenoceptor Agonist is a Theravance Compound:            Milestone

* GSK will make a Phase I milestone payment for both TD-3327 and AMI-15471. The Phase I milestone for TD-3327 is defined as initiation of the methacholine challenge portion of the Phase I Study in normal volunteers and will trigger a payment of U.S. $10 Million. The Phase I milestone for AMI-15471 is defined as initiation of the first Phase I Study in normal volunteers and will trigger a payment of U.S. $10 Million.   **Phase IIa is defined as initiation of the first single dose study in patients where such study is statistically powered for efficacy based on FEV . Phase IIb is defined as initiation of the first four (4) week dosing, safety and efficacy study in patients.   Other Combination Products that contain a Long-Acting β2 Adrenoceptor Agonist that is a Theravance Compound are not subject to milestone payments by GSK only if all milestone payments through launch have otherwise been made to Theravance from any Collaboration Product as both a single-agent and as a combination product. The Parties intend that if the collaboration is successful in launching at least two Collaboration Products that contain a Theravance Compound, Theravance be paid the applicable milestones through launch for two products.   If GSK, either individually or as a member of the Joint Steering Committee or Joint Project Committee, discontinues the Development of a single agent Collaboration Product that is a Theravance Compound for reasons other than Technical Failure, and such compound is the LABA in a LABA/ICS Combination Product or in an Other Combination Product, it will compensate Theravance for the unpaid milestone payments otherwise due to Theravance under Section 6.2.2 by adding the unpaid milestone amounts for such discontinued single agent product onto the corresponding milestone payments for the relevant Combination Product.   6.2.3 Theravance to GSK. Theravance shall make the following milestone payments to GSK upon the achievement of the indicated Development Milestone for the first Collaboration Product in which the Long-Acting β2 Adrenoceptor Agonist is a GSK Compound   23

The Parties intend that if the collaboration is successful in launching at least two Collaboration Products that contain a GSK Compound, GSK be paid the applicable milestones through launch for two products.   6.2.4 Notification and Payment. In the event a Party achieves a Development Milestone, such Party shall promptly, but in no event more than ten (10) days after the achievement of each such Development Milestone, notify the other Party in writing of the achievement of same. For all Development Milestones achieved, each Party shall promptly, but in no event more than thirty (30) days after notification of the achievement of each such Development Milestone, remit payment to the other Party for such Development Milestone.   6.3 Payment of Royalties on Net Sales.   6.3.1 Royalty on Single-Agent Collaboration Products and LABA/ICS Combination Products.   Within twenty (20) days after the end of each Calendar Quarter , GSK shall pay Theravance royalty payments based on Net Sales in such Calendar Quarter during the Term as follows:        On total Annual Worldwide Net Sales up to and including U.S. $3 Billion:

  15   %                   On total Annual Worldwide Net Sales greater than U.S. $3 Billion:

  5   %     it being understood that Net Sales of a single agent Collaboration Product will be combined with Net Sales of a LABA/ICS Combination Product for purposes of the foregoing royalty calculation.   The quarterly royalty payments made under this Section 6.3.1 may be based on estimated Net Sales. Within thirty (30) days after the end of each Calendar Quarter, GSK shall calculate the actual amount of Net Sales for the previous Calendar Quarter and either credit or debit the difference between such actual and projected amount on the succeeding Calendar Quarter's royalty payment to Theravance. As soon as practical following the end of each Calendar Month, but in no event later than the 10 business day of the following month, GSK will provide Theravance with an estimate of Net Sales for such Calendar Month.   24

th





  The royalties payable under this Section 6.3 shall be paid on a Country-by-Country basis from the date of first commercial sale of each Collaboration Product in a particular Country for the Term of the Collaboration.   6.3.2 Royalty Adjustment. The 15% royalty payable on the first U.S. $3 Billion of total annual worldwide Net Sales under this Section 6.3 shall be reduced to 12% if all of the following occur: (i) all Theravance Compounds are discontinued by the collaboration for Technical Failure; (ii) Theravance only contributes one Theravance New Compound to the collaboration within 18 months following the Effective Date; and (iii) the Collaboration Product upon which the royalty is payable contains a LABA that is one of the GSK Initially Pooled Compounds. The 15% royalty payable on the first U.S. $3 Billion of total annual worldwide Net Sales under this Section 6.3 shall be reduced to 10% if all of the following occur: (i) all Theravance Compounds are discontinued by the collaboration for Technical Failure; (ii) Theravance fails to contribute any Theravance New Compound to the collaboration within 18 months following the Effective Date; and (iii) the Collaboration Product upon which the royalty is payable contains a LABA that is one of the GSK Initially Pooled Compounds. Nothing in the foregoing shall affect other royalties owed under this Agreement.   6.3.3 Royalties on Other Collaboration Products Launched After the LABA/ICS Combination Product. For any Other Collaboration Product launched after the LABA/ICS Combination Product, GSK shall within twenty (20) days after the end of each Calendar Quarter, pay Theravance royalty payments based on Net Sales in such Calendar Quarter during the Term as follows:

Annual Net Sales



Percentage Royalty

                  Up to U.S.$750 Million

  6.5   %                   Additional Net Sales up to U.S.$1.25 Billion

  8.0   %                   Additional Net Sales up to U.S.$2.25 Billion

  9.0   %                   Net Sales exceeding U.S.$2.25 Billion

  10.0   %     For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties agree that the royalty set forth in this Section 6.3.3 shall only be effective if GSK has launched and is selling a LABA/ICS Combination Product that is subject to the royalties under Section 6.3.1. If GSK is not selling a LABA/ICS Combination Product, then the royalty set forth in Section 6.3.1 shall apply to the first Other Combination Product launched by GSK, provided such Other Combination Product does not contain a product in-licensed by GSK; if such Other Combination Product contains a product in-licensed by GSK, then the royalty payable to Theravance will be reduced by 50% of any running royalties paid to a Third Party, provided that in no case will the royalty payable to Theravance be less than set forth in this Section 6.3.3.   25





  6.4 Royalty Responsibilities; Net Sales Reports.   6.4.1 Payments to Third Parties.   (a) If, as a result of a settlement approved by both Parties or as a result of a final non-appealable judgment, GSK is required to pay any amounts to a Third Party directly because using or selling a Theravance Compound is found to infringe the rights of such Third Party, GSK shall deduct fifty percent (50%) of any such amount paid to such Third Party from the royalties otherwise due Theravance for the Collaboration Product containing such Theravance Compound, provided in no event shall such reduction reduce the royalties otherwise payable to Theravance during any Calendar Year by more than fifty percent (50%); provided, further, that any excess deduction shall be carried over into subsequent years of this Agreement until the full deduction is taken.   (b) GSK shall pay any amounts owed to a Third Party as a result of the use of GSK Patents or GSK Know-How with respect to sales of Collaboration Products and shall not deduct any of such amounts from the royalties due Theravance. The foregoing is subject to Section 6.3.3.   6.4.2 Net Sales Report. Within thirty (30) days after the end of each Calendar Quarter, GSK shall submit to Theravance a written report setting forth Net Sales in the Territory on a Country-by-Country and Collaboration Product-by-Collaboration Product basis during such Calendar Quarter, total royalty payments due Theravance, relevant market share data and any payments made to any Third Party pursuant to Section 6.4.1(a) (each a "Net Sales Report").   6.5 GAAP. All financial terms and standards defined or used in this Agreement for sales or activities occurring in the United States shall be governed by and determined in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied. Except as otherwise set forth herein, all financial terms and standards defined or used in this Agreement for sales or activities occurring outside the United States shall be governed by and determined in accordance with United Kingdom generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied.   6.6 Currencies. Monetary conversion from the currency of a foreign country in which Collaboration Product is sold into US Dollars shall be calculated in accordance with either (a) the methodology referred to in GSK's then current Corporate Finance Reporting Policy or (b) as otherwise may be mutually agreed by the Parties. The following summarizes GSK's current methodology applied in accordance with its current Corporate Finance Reporting System: the cumulative year-to-date Average Rates are calculated by determining the average of (i) the preceding 31st December Spot Rate plus (ii) the Closing Spot Rates of the relevant months to date using the exact figures provided by the Reuters 2000 download. (By way of example, the Average Rate for the five months from January, 2002 to May, 2002 would be computed by taking the sum of the Spot Rates for the preceding 31st December, 2001, plus the month-end Spot Rates for the five months to May, 2002, divided by six).   6.7 Manner of Payments. All sums due to either Party under this Section 6 shall be payable in United States Dollars by bank wire transfer in immediately available funds to such bank account(s) as each of GSK and Theravance shall designate. GSK shall notify Theravance as to the date and amount of any such wire transfer to Theravance at least five (5) Business Days prior to such transfer. Theravance shall notify GSK as to the date and amount of any such wire transfer to GSK at least five (5) Business Days prior to such transfer.   26





  6.8 Interest on Late Payments. If either Theravance or GSK shall fail to make a timely payment pursuant to this Article 6, any such payment that is not paid on or before the date such payment is due under this Agreement shall bear interest, to the extent permitted by applicable law, at the average one-month London Inter-Bank Offering Rate (LIBOR) for the United States Dollar as reported from time to time in The Wall Street Journal, effective for the first date on which payment was delinquent and calculated on the number of days such payment is overdue or, if such rate is not regularly published, as published in such source as the Joint Steering Committee agrees.   6.9 Tax Withholding.   6.9.1 Any taxes, levies or other duties ("Taxes") paid or required to be withheld under the appropriate local tax laws by one of the Parties ("Withholding Party") on account of monies payable to the other Party under this Agreement shall, subject to Sections 6.9.2 and 6.9.3, be deducted from the amount of monies otherwise payable to the other Party under this Agreement. The Withholding Party shall secure and send to the other Party within a reasonable period of time proof of any such Taxes paid or required to be withheld by Withholding Party for the benefit of the other Party.   6.9.2 If GSK or any GSK Affiliate is or becomes liable to withhold any taxes from payments made to Theravance under Sections 6.1 and 6.2 of this Agreement, then GSK shall pay to Theravance an amount equal to the amount GSK or the applicable GSK Affiliate owes to the relevant tax authority provided always that if Theravance is able to obtain credit for any taxes withheld ("Creditable Taxes") against any liability to tax either in the year in which the receipt is taxable or any preceding years, Theravance shall reimburse to GSK an amount equivalent to the Creditable Taxes. Theravance shall provide GSK with such reasonable evidence as GSK may reasonably request to determine whether the taxes are creditable against taxes payable by Theravance.   6.9.3 If GSK or any GSK Affiliate is or becomes liable to withhold any taxes from payments made to Theravance under Section 6.3, then such taxes may be withheld by GSK or the applicable GSK Affiliate up to a limit of five percent (5%) of the relevant payment. GSK shall pay to Theravance an amount equal to the amount GSK owes to the relevant tax authority in excess of such five percent (5%) provided always that if Theravance is able to obtain credit for any taxes withheld ("Creditable Taxes") against any liability to tax either in the year in which the receipt is taxable or any preceding years, Theravance shall reimburse to GSK an amount equivalent to the Creditable Taxes. Theravance shall provide GSK with such reasonable evidence as GSK may reasonably request to determine whether the taxes are creditable against taxes payable by Theravance.   6.10 Financial Records; Audits. GSK shall keep, and shall cause its Affiliates and sublicensees to keep, such accurate and complete records of Net Sales as are necessary to determine the amounts due to Theravance under this Agreement and such records shall be retained by GSK or any of its Affiliates or sublicensees (in such capacity, the "Recording Party") for at least the three preceding Calendar Years to which the Net Sales relate. During normal business hours and with reasonable advance notice to the Recording Party, such records shall be made available for inspection, review and audit, at the request and expense of Theravance, by an independent certified public accountant, or the local equivalent, appointed by Theravance and reasonably acceptable to the Recording Party for the sole purpose of verifying the accuracy of the Recording Party's accounting reports and payments made or to be made pursuant to this   27





  Agreement; provided, however that such audits may not be performed by Theravance more than once per Calendar Year. Such accountants shall be instructed not to reveal to Theravance the details of its review, except for (i) such information as is required to be disclosed under this Agreement and (ii) such information presented in a summary fashion as is necessary to report the accountants' conclusions to Theravance, and all such information shall be deemed Confidential Information of the Recording Party; provided, however, that in any event such information may be presented to Theravance in a summary fashion as is necessary to report the accountants' conclusions. All costs and expenses incurred in connection with performing any such audit shall be paid by Theravance unless the audit discloses at least a five percent (5%) shortfall, in which case the Recording Party will bear the full cost of the audit for such Calendar Year. Theravance will be entitled to recover any shortfall in payments due to it as determined by such audit, plus interest thereon calculated in accordance with Section 6.8, or alternatively shall have the right to offset and deduct any such shortfall in payments due to it against payments Theravance is otherwise required to make to the Reporting Party under this Agreement. The documents from which were calculated the sums due under this Article 6 shall be retained by the relevant Party during the Term.   ARTICLE 7 PROMOTIONAL MATERIALS AND SAMPLES   7.1 Promotional Materials.   7.1.1 Review of Core Promotional Materials. Subject to applicable Law, in accordance with the direction of the Joint Project Committee, the Parties will jointly, through consultation and with the assistance of each other, review the core Promotional Materials. The relevant legal or regulatory personnel of each Party shall have the opportunity to review and comment on all such core Promotional Materials prior to use and such comments shall be considered by the Joint Project Committee in the review of such core Promotional Materials.   7.1.2 Markings of Promotional Materials. To the extent required by applicable Law, and further to the extent reasonably practicable, all Promotional Materials will indicate the contribution of the license from Theravance for the Collaboration Products. Subject to the foregoing, the Theravance Housemark and the GSK Housemark shall both be given exposure and prominence on all promotional materials, labelling, package inserts or outserts and packaging for the Collaboration Products.   7.2 Samples. Packaging, package inserts and outserts, Sample labels and labeling shall each contain reference to Theravance and GSK indicating, in the case of Theravance, the contribution of the license from Theravance for the Collaboration Products, if appropriate, and as may be required under applicable FDA rules and regulations.   7.3 Statements Consistent with Labeling. GSK shall ensure that its sales representatives detail the Collaboration Products in a fair and balanced manner and consistent with the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of the United States, as amended, including, but not limited to, the regulations at 21 C.F.R. (S) 202 in the United States.   7.4 Implications of Change in Control in Theravance. In the event that there is a Change in Control of Theravance and the references contemplated in Sections 7.1.2 and 7.2 are no longer made to "Theravance,", then other than to the extent required by applicable Law, GSK   28





  shall have the right, not to be unreasonably exercised, to terminate its obligations under Sections 7.1 and 7.2.   ARTICLE 8 REGULATORY MATTERS   8.1 Governmental Authorities. GSK shall be solely responsible for communicating with Governmental Authorities and will keep Theravance informed, through the Joint Project Committee and Joint Steering Committee, of any significant issue or issues arising therefrom.   8.2 Filings. GSK shall also be solely responsible for filing drug approval applications for Collaboration Products and will use Diligent Efforts in seeking appropriate approvals in those Countries of the Territory for Collaboration Products as GSK reasonably determines and sees fit. Such regulatory documents for each filing shall be centralized and held at the offices of GSK. Theravance shall provide such reasonable assistance as may be required by GSK where liaison between the Parties is, or may be, necessary to enable GSK to fulfill its responsibilities hereunder. GSK shall be responsible for maintaining the Approvals obtained under this Section and shall solely own all such Approvals in the Territory. GSK shall be fully responsible for bearing all costs and expense associated with undertaking and completing said registration activities in the Territory, including but not limited to the costs of preparing and prosecuting applications for such Approvals and fees payable to regulatory agencies in obtaining and maintaining same.   8.3 Exchange of Drug Safety Information. Subject to the second sentence of this Section 8.3, GSK shall be responsible for recording, investigating, summarizing, notifying, reporting and reviewing all Adverse Drug Experiences in accordance with Law and shall require that its Affiliates (i) adhere to all requirements of applicable Laws which relate to the reporting and investigation of Adverse Drug Experiences, and (ii) keep the Joint Project Committee apprised on a regular basis of such matters arising therefrom. The foregoing shall be subject to any of Theravance's own clinical safety obligations mandated by Law as a result of its ongoing Development activity related to TD-3327 (as such activity is more specifically referred to in Article 4) and, in acknowledgement of this, it is thereby contemplated that the Parties' respective clinical safety groups may need to discuss and agree, at the appropriate time after the Effective Date, appropriate safety data exchange procedures related to same.   8.4 Recalls or Other Corrective Action. Each Party shall, as soon as practicable, notify the other Party of any recall information received by it in sufficient detail to allow the Parties to comply with any and all applicable Laws. GSK shall promptly notify Theravance of any material actions to be taken by GSK with respect to any recall or market withdrawal or other corrective action related to a Collaboration Product prior to such action to permit Theravance a reasonable opportunity to consult with GSK with respect thereto. All costs and expenses with respect to a recall, market withdrawal or other corrective action shall be borne by GSK unless such recall, market withdrawal or other corrective action was due solely to the negligence, willful misconduct or breach of this Agreement by Theravance. GSK shall have sole responsibility for and shall make all decisions with respect to any recall, market withdrawals or any other corrective action related to the Collaboration Products.   8.5 Events Affecting Integrity or Reputation. During the Term, the Parties shall notify each other immediately of any circumstances of which they are aware and which could impair the integrity and reputation of the Collaboration Products or if a Party is threatened by the   29





  unlawful activity of any Third Party in relation to the Collaboration Products, which circumstances shall include, by way of illustration, deliberate tampering with or contamination of the Collaboration Products by any Third Party as a means of extorting payment from the Parties or another Third Party. In any such circumstances, the Parties shall use Diligent Efforts to limit any damage to the Parties and/or to the Collaboration Products. The Parties shall promptly call a Joint Steering Committee meeting to discuss and resolve such circumstances.   ARTICLE 9 ORDERS; SUPPLY AND RETURNS   9.1 Orders and Terms of Sale.

  12.3 Procedure for Indemnification.   12.3.1 Notice. Each Party will notify promptly the other in writing if it becomes aware of a Claim (actual or potential) by any Third Party (a "Third Party Claim") for which indemnification may be sought by that Party and will give such information with respect thereto as the other Party shall reasonably request. If any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) is instituted involving any Party for which such Party may seek an indemnity under Section 12.1 or 12.2, as the case may be (the "Indemnified Party"), the Indemnified Party shall not make any admission or statement concerning such Third Party Claim, but shall promptly notify the other Party (the "Indemnifying Party") orally and in writing and the Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party shall meet to discuss how to respond to any Third Party Claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding. The Indemnifying Party shall not be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party to the extent any admission or statement made by the Indemnified Party or any failure by such Party to notify the Indemnifying Party of the claim materially prejudices the defense of such claim.   12.3.2 Defense of Claim. If the Indemnifying Party elects to defend or, if local procedural rules or laws do not permit the same, elects to control the defense of a Third Party Claim, it shall be entitled to do so provided it gives notice to the Indemnified Party of its intention to do so within forty-five (45) days after the receipt of the written notice from the Indemnified Party of the potentially indemnifiable Third Party Claim (the "Litigation Condition"). The Indemnifying Party expressly agrees the Indemnifying Party shall be responsible for satisfying and discharging any award made to or settlement reached with the Third Party pursuant to the terms of this Agreement without prejudice to any provision in this Agreement or right at law which will allow the Indemnifying Party subsequently to recover any amount from the Indemnified Party to the extent the liability under such settlement or award was attributable to the Indemnified Party. Subject to compliance with the Litigation Condition, the Indemnifying Party shall retain counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party (such acceptance not to be unreasonably withheld, refused, conditioned or delayed) to represent the Indemnified Party and shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall not settle any claim for which it is seeking indemnification without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, refused, conditioned or delayed. The Indemnified Party shall, if requested by the Indemnifying Party, cooperate in all reasonable respects in the defense of such claim that is being managed and/or controlled by the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party shall not, without the written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, refused, conditioned or delayed), effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in which the Indemnified Party is, or based on the same set of facts could have been, a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by the Indemnified Party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of the Indemnified Party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding. If the Litigation Condition is not met, then neither Party shall have the right to control the defense of such Third Party Claim and the Parties shall cooperate in and be consulted on the material aspects of such defense at each Party's own expense; provided that if the Indemnifying Party does not satisfy the Litigation Condition, the Indemnifying Party may at any subsequent time during the pendency of the relevant Third Party Claim irrevocably elect, if permitted by local procedural rules or laws, to defend and/or to control the defense of the relevant Third Party Claim so long as the Indemnifying Party also agrees to pay the reasonable fees and costs incurred by the Indemnified Party in relation to the defense of such Third Party Claim from   36





  the inception of the Third Party Claim until the date the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense or control thereof.   12.4 Assumption of Defense. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, an Indemnified Party shall be entitled to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim with respect to the Indemnified Party, upon written notice to the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Section 12.4, in which case the Indemnifying Party shall be relieved of liability under Section 12.1 or 12.2, as applicable, solely for such Third Party Claim and related Losses.   12.5 Insurance. During the Term of this Agreement and for a period of one (1) year after the termination or expiration of this Agreement, GSK shall obtain and/or maintain at its sole cost and expense, product liability insurance (including any self-insured arrangements) in amounts which are reasonable and customary in the U.S. pharmaceutical industry for companies of comparable size and activities. Such product liability insurance or self-insured arrangements shall insure against all liability, including without limitation personal injury, physical injury, or property damage arising out of the manufacture, sale, distribution, or marketing of the Collaboration Products. GSK shall provide written proof of the existence of such insurance to Theravance upon request.   ARTICLE 13 PATENTS   13.1 Prosecution and Maintenance of Patents.   13.1.1 Prosecution and Maintenance of Theravance Patents. Theravance shall have the exclusive right and the obligation to (subject to Theravance's election not to file, prosecute, or maintain pursuant to Section 13.1.4) or to cause its licensors to, prepare, file, prosecute in a diligent manner (including without limitation by conducting interferences, oppositions and reexaminations or other similar proceedings), maintain (by timely paying all maintenance fees, renewal fees, and other such fees and costs required under applicable Laws) and extend all Theravance Patents and related applications. Theravance shall consult with GSK prior to abandoning any Theravance Patents or related applications that are material to the matters contemplated in this Agreement. Theravance shall regularly advise GSK of the status of all pending applications, including with respect to any hearings or other proceedings before any Governmental Authority, and, at GSK's request, shall provide GSK with copies of all documentation concerning such applications, including all correspondence to and from any Governmental Authority. Subject to Section 2.3.3, Theravance shall solicit GSK's advice and review of the nature and text of such patent applications and important prosecution matters related thereto in reasonably sufficient time prior to filing thereof, and Theravance shall take into account GSK's reasonable comments related thereto; provided, however, Theravance shall have the final decision authority with respect to any action relating to any Theravance Patent. Within the priority period, Theravance shall agree with GSK regarding the countries outside the United States in which corresponding applications should be filed ("OUS Filings"). It is presumed that a corresponding Patent Cooperation Treaty ("PCT") application will be filed unless otherwise agreed by the Parties. Theravance shall effect filing of all such applications within the priority period.   Subject to Section 13.1.4, Theravance shall be responsible for all costs incurred in the United States in connection with procuring Theravance Patents, including applications preparation, filing fees, prosecution, maintenance and all costs associated with reexamination and   37





  interference proceedings in the United States Patent and Trademark Office and United States Courts. GSK shall be responsible for all out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Theravance after the Effective Date that are associated with procuring corresponding OUS patents, including without limitation PCT and individual country filing fees, translations, maintenance, annuities, and protest proceedings. For all such OUS patent applications, Theravance will invoice GSK on a quarterly basis beginning April 1, 2003, setting forth all such expenses incurred. Reimbursement will be made to Theravance in United States Dollars within thirty (30) days of receipt of the invoice by GSK. GSK will within thirty (30) days following the Effective Date identify the GSK representative that should receive such invoices from Theravance. GSK's obligations hereunder are in addition to any obligations of GSK under Section 13.1.2(b)   13.1.2 Prosecution and Maintenance of Patents Covering Joint Inventions.   (a) For Patents covering Joint Inventions, the Parties shall agree, without prejudice to ownership, which Party shall have the right to prepare and file a priority patent application, and prosecute such application(s) and maintain any patents derived therefrom, with the Parties equally sharing the reasonable out-of-pocket costs for the preparation, filing, prosecution and maintenance of such priority patent application. The Parties will reasonably cooperate to obtain any export licenses that might be required for such activities. Should the agreed upon Party elect not to prepare and/or file any such priority patent application, it shall (i) provide the other Party with written notice as soon as reasonably possible after making such election but in any event no later than sixty (60) days before the other Party would be faced with a possible loss of rights, (ii) give the other Party the right, at the other Party's discretion and sole expense, to prepare and file the priority application(s), and (iii) offer reasonable assistance in connection with such preparation and filing at no cost to the other Party except for reimbursement of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the agreed upon Party in rendering such assistance. The other Party, at its discretion and cost, shall prosecute such application(s) and maintain sole ownership of any patents derived therefrom.   (b) Within nine (9) months after the filing date of a priority application directed to an Invention, the Party filing the priority application shall request that the other Party identify those non-priority, non-PCT ("foreign") Countries in which the other Party desires that the Party filing the priority application file corresponding patent applications. Within thirty (30) days after receipt by the other Party of such request from the Party filing the priority application, the other Party shall provide to the Party filing the priority application a written list of such foreign countries in which the other Party wishes to effect corresponding foreign patent applications filings. The Parties will then attempt to agree on the particular countries in which such applications will be filed, provided that in the event agreement is not reached, the application will be filed in the disputed as well as the non-disputed countries (all such filings referred to hereinafter as "Designated Foreign Filings"). Thereafter, within twelve (12) months after the filing date of the priority application, the Party filing the priority application shall effect all such Designated Foreign Filings. It is presumed unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Parties, that a corresponding PCT application will be filed designating all PCT member countries. As to each Designated Foreign Filing and PCT application, GSK shall bear the costs for the filing and prosecutions of such Designated Foreign Filing and PCT application (including entering national phase in all agreed countries). Should the Party filing the priority application not agree to file or cause to be filed a Designated Foreign Filing, the other Party will have the right to effect such Designated Foreign Filing in its name.   38





  (c) Should the filing Party pursuant to Section 13.1.2(a) or 13.1.2(b) no longer wish to prosecute and/or maintain any patent application or patent resulting from such application, the filing Party shall (i) provide the non-filing Party with written notice of its wish no later than sixty (60) days before the patent or patent applications would otherwise become abandoned, (ii) give the non-filing Party the right, at the non-filing Party's election and sole expense, to prosecute and/or maintain such patent or patent application, and (iii) offer reasonable assistance to the non- filing Party in connection with such prosecution and/or maintenance at no cost to the non-filing Party except for reimbursement of the filing Party's reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the filing Party in rendering such assistance.   (d) Should the non-filing Party pursuant to Section 13.1.2(c) not wish to incur its share of preparation, filing, prosecution and/or maintenance costs for a patent application filed pursuant to Section 13.1.2(a) or 13.1.2(b) or patents derived therefrom, it shall (i) provide the filing Party with written notice of its wish, and (ii) continue to offer reasonable assistance to the filing Party in connection with such prosecution or maintenance at no cost to the filing Party except for reimbursement of the non-filing Party's reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the non-filing Party in rendering such assistance.   (e) The Parties agree to cooperate in the preparation and prosecution of all patent applications filed under Section 13.1.2(a) and 13.1.2(b), including obtaining and executing necessary powers of attorney and assignments by the named inventors, providing relevant technical reports to the filing Party concerning the invention disclosed in such patent application, obtaining execution of such other documents which shall be needed in the filing and prosecution of such patent applications, and, as requested, updating each other regarding the status of such patent applications.   13.1.3 Prosecution and Maintenance of GSK Patents. GSK shall have the exclusive right and obligation to (subject to GSK's election not to file, prosecute or maintain pursuant to Section 13.1.5) or to cause its licensors to, prepare, file and prosecute in a diligent manner (including without limitation by conducting interferences, oppositions and reexaminations or other similar proceedings), maintain (by timely paying all maintenance fees, renewal fees, and other such fees and costs required under applicable Laws) and extend all GSK Patents and related applications. Consistent with Section 2.3.3, GSK will consult with Theravance within the priority period for any patent application that is material to this Agreement concerning Countries in which corresponding applications will be filed. In the event the Parties can not agree, GSK shall make the final decision. GSK shall consult with Theravance prior to abandoning any GSK Patents or related applications that are material to the matters contemplated in this Agreement. GSK shall regularly advise Theravance of the status of all pending applications, including with respect to any hearings or other proceedings before any Governmental Authority, and, at Theravance's request, shall provide Theravance with copies of documentation relating to such applications, including all correspondence to and from any Governmental Authority. Subject to Section 2.3.3, GSK shall solicit Theravance's advice and review of the nature and text of such patent applications and important prosecution matters related thereto in reasonably sufficient time prior to filing thereof, and GSK shall take into account Theravance's reasonable comments relating thereto; provided that GSK shall have the final decision authority with respect to any action relating to a GSK Patent.   13.1.4 GSK Step-In Rights. If Theravance elects not to file, prosecute or maintain the Theravance Patents or claims encompassed by such Theravance Patents necessary for GSK to exercise its rights hereunder in any Country, Theravance shall give GSK notice thereof within a reasonable period prior to allowing such Theravance Patents, or such claims encompassed by   39





  such Theravance Patents, to lapse or become abandoned or unenforceable, and GSK shall thereafter have the right, at its sole expense, to prepare, file, prosecute and maintain such Theravance Patents in such Country.   13.1.5 Theravance Step-In Rights. If GSK elects not to file, prosecute or maintain the GSK Patents or claims encompassed by such GSK Patents necessary for Theravance to exercise its license rights hereunder in any Country, GSK shall give Theravance notice thereof within a reasonable period prior to allowing such GSK Patents, or such claims encompassed by such GSK Patents, to lapse or become abandoned or unenforceable, and Theravance shall thereafter have the right, at its sole expense, to prepare, file, prosecute and maintain such GSK Patents in such Country. In the event that GSK elects not to file, prosecute or maintain GSK Patents or claims that would affect the royalty owed Theravance pursuant to Section 6.3, GSK shall reimburse Theravance for all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Theravance in connection with Theravance exercising its Step-In Rights under this Section.   13.1.6 Execution of Documents by Agents. Each of the Parties shall execute or have executed by its appropriate agents such documents as may be necessary to obtain, perfect or maintain any Patent Rights filed or to be filed pursuant to this Agreement, and shall cooperate with the other Party so far as reasonably necessary with respect to furnishing all information and data in its possession reasonably necessary to obtain or maintain such Patent Rights.   13.1.7 Patent Term Extensions. The Parties shall cooperate with each other in gaining patent term extension where applicable to Collaboration Products. The Joint Steering Committee shall determine which patents the Parties shall endeavor to have extended. All filings for such extension will be made by the Party to whom the patent is assigned after consultation with the other Party. In the event the Joint Steering Committee can not agree, the Party who is assigned the compound patent covering the LABA in the Collaboration Product will make the decision.   13.2 Patent Infringement.   13.2.1 Infringement Claims. With respect to any and all Claims instituted by Third Parties against Theravance or GSK or any of their respective Affiliates for patent infringement involving the manufacture, use, license, marketing or sale of a Collaboration Product in the United States during the Term (each, a "Patent Infringement Claim") as applicable, Theravance and GSK will assist one another and cooperate in the defense and settlement of such Patent Infringement Claims at the other Party's request.   13.2.2 Infringement of Theravance Patents. In the event that Theravance or GSK becomes aware of actual or threatened infringement of a Theravance Patent during the Term, that Party will promptly notify the other Party in writing (a "Patent Infringement Notice"). Theravance will have the right but not the obligation to bring an infringement action against any Third Party. If Theravance elects to pursue such infringement action, Theravance shall be solely responsible for the costs and expenses associated with such action and retain all recoveries. During the Term, in the event that Theravance does not undertake such an infringement action, upon Theravance's written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, refused, conditioned or delayed, GSK shall be permitted to do so in Theravance's or the relevant Theravance Affiliate's name and on Theravance's or the relevant Theravance Affiliate's behalf. If Theravance has consented to an infringement action but GSK is not recognized by the applicable court or other relevant body as having the requisite standing to pursue such action, then GSK may join Theravance as party-plaintiff. If GSK elects to pursue such infringement action, Theravance may be represented in   40





  such action by attorneys of its own choice and its own expense with GSK taking the lead in such action.   13.2.3 Infringement of GSK Patents. In the event that GSK or Theravance becomes aware of actual or threatened infringement of a GSK Patent during the Term, that Party will promptly notify the other Party in writing. GSK will have the right but not the obligation to bring an infringement action against any Third Party. If GSK elects to pursue such infringement action, GSK shall be solely responsible for the costs and expenses associated with such action and retain all recoveries. During the Term, in the event that GSK does not undertake such an infringement action, upon GSK's written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, refused, conditioned or delayed, Theravance shall be permitted to do so in GSK's or the relevant GSK Affiliate's name and on GSK's or the relevant GSK Affiliate's behalf. If GSK has consented to an infringement action but Theravance is not recognized by the applicable court or other relevant body as having the requisite standing to pursue such action, then Theravance may join GSK as a party-plaintiff. If Theravance elects to pursue such infringement action, GSK may be represented in such action by attorneys of its own choice and at its own expense, with Theravance taking the lead in such action.   13.3 Notice of Certification. GSK and Theravance each shall immediately give notice to the other of any certification filed under the "U.S. Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984" (or its foreign equivalent) claiming that a GSK Patent or a Theravance Patent is invalid or that infringement will not arise from the manufacture, use or sale of any Collaboration Product by a Third Party ("Hatch-Waxman Certification").   13.3.1 Notice. If a Party decides not to bring infringement proceedings against the entity making such a certification, such Party shall give notice to the other Party of its decision not to bring suit within twenty-one (21) days after receipt of notice of such certification.   13.3.2 Option. Such other Party then may, but is not required to, bring suit against the entity that filed the certification.   13.3.3 Name of Party. Any suit by Theravance or GSK shall either be in the name of Theravance or in the name of GSK, (or any Affiliate) or jointly in the name of Theravance and GSK (or any Affiliate) , as may be required by law.   13.4 Assistance. For purposes of this Article 13, the Party not bringing suit shall execute such legal papers necessary for the prosecution of such suit as may be reasonably requested by the Party bringing suit. The out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the Party bringing suit shall be reimbursed first out of any damages or other monetary awards recovered in favor of GSK or Theravance. The documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the other Party shall then be reimbursed out of any remaining damages or other monetary awards. The Party initiating and prosecuting the action to completion will retain any remaining damages or other monetary awards following such reimbursements.   13.5 Settlement. No settlement or consent judgment or other voluntary final disposition of a suit under this Article may be entered into without the joint written consent of GSK and Theravance (which consent will not be withheld unreasonably).   41





  ARTICLE 14 TERM AND TERMINATION   14.1 Term and Expiration of Term. Unless otherwise mutually agreed to by the Parties, this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall end upon expiration of the Term, unless terminated early as contemplated hereunder.

Any such termination shall become effective at the end of such 60-day period unless the Breaching Party has cured any such breach or default prior to the expiration of such 60-day period (or, if such default is capable of being cured but cannot be cured within such 60-day period, the Breaching Party has commenced and diligently continued actions to cure such default provided always that, in such instance, such cure must have occurred within one hundred twenty (120) days after written notice thereof was provided to the Breaching Party by the non-breaching Party to remedy such default).   14.3 GSK Right to Terminate Development of a Collaboration Product. On a Collaboration Product-by-Collaboration Product basis, and at any time during Development and prior to First Commercial Sale of the applicable Collaboration Product, GSK shall have the right to terminate Development of such Collaboration Product (upon the provision of ninety (90) days written notice) for reasons of Technical Failure or Commercial Failure following communication to, and assessment of such proposed termination by, the Joint Project Committee and Joint Steering Committee (in which case such Collaboration Product shall be referred to as a "Terminated Development Collaboration Product"). For the avoidance of doubt, a "Terminated Development Collaboration Product" can be any of the following: (i) a Pooled Compound and/or (ii) a Replacement Compound and/or (iii) a single agent LABA Collaboration Product and/or (iv) a LABA/ICS Combination Product and/or (v) an Other Combination Product.   14.4 GSK Right to Terminate Commercialization of a Collaboration Product Following First Commercial Sale.

For the avoidance of doubt, a Terminated Commercialized Collaboration Product can be any of the following: (i) a single agent LABA Collaboration Product and/or (ii) a LABA/ICS Combination Product and/or (iii) an Other Combination Product.   42





  14.5 Termination of the Agreement Due to Discontinuation of Development of All Collaboration Products and All Pooled Compounds . Any time following the third anniversary of the Effective Date, either Party may terminate this Agreement, subject to Section 14.10, upon the provision of ninety (90) days written notice if Development of all Collaboration Products and all Pooled Compounds have been discontinued for Technical Failure and/or Commercial Failure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that (i) Development of all Collaboration Products and all Pooled Compounds (including any Replacement Compounds) has ceased for at least three (3) months, (ii) all such termination and/or discontinuance decisions have been validly approved by the Joint Steering Committee, and (iii) both parties have provided written notice to the other that such party does not intend to contribute any additional Replacement Compounds to the collaboration, then either Party shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement, subject to Section 14.10, upon the provision of ninety (90) days written notice.   14.6 Effects of Termination.   14.6.1 Effect of Termination for Material Breach.   (a) Material Breach by Theravance. In the event this Agreement is terminated by GSK pursuant to Section 14.2 for material breach by Theravance, all licenses granted by Theravance to GSK under this Agreement shall survive, subject to GSK's continued obligation to pay milestones and royalties to Theravance hereunder. In such event, GSK shall retain all of its rights to bring an action against Theravance for damages and any other available remedies in law or equity, and shall be entitled to set-off against any monies payable to Theravance hereunder all amounts GSK reasonably believes constitute its damages incurred by such breach, subject to final judicial resolution or settlement. Also, Theravance shall, at its sole expense, promptly transfer to GSK copies of all data, reports, records and materials in its possession or control that relate to the Collaboration Products that contain a GSK Compound and return to GSK, or destroy at GSK's request, all relevant records and materials in its possession or control containing Confidential Information of GSK (provided that Theravance may keep one copy of such Confidential Information of GSK for archival purposes only in accordance with Section 10.1).   (b) Material Breach By GSK. In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Theravance pursuant to Section 14.2 for material breach by GSK:   (i) GSK shall, at its sole expense, promptly transfer to Theravance copies of all data, reports, records and materials in its possession or control that relate to the Theravance Compounds and return to Theravance, or destroy at Theravance's request, all relevant records and materials in its possession or control containing Confidential Information of Theravance (provided that GSK may keep one copy of such Confidential Information of Theravance for archival purposes only in accordance with Section 10.1). (ii) GSK shall, at its sole expense, transfer to Theravance, or shall cause its designee(s) to transfer to Theravance, ownership of all regulatory filings made or filed for any Collaboration Product that contains a LABA as a single agent (to the extent that any are held in GSK's or such designee(s)'s name), and such transfer to be as permitted by applicable Laws and regulations; otherwise GSK shall cooperate as necessary to permit Theravance to exercise its rights hereunder. (iii) Theravance shall have the non-exclusive right to access, use and cite in any regulatory filing any data relating to formulation of a LABA/ICS Combination Product or Other Combination Product.   43

If GSK terminates a Collaboration Product at any time after initiation of the first Phase III Study concerning such Collaboration Product, and Development of all other Collaboration Products and Pooled Compounds have been discontinued for Technical Failure and/or Commercial Failure, then at the sole election of Theravance, the following shall apply:   (a) GSK shall, at its sole expense, promptly transfer to Theravance copies of all data, reports, records and materials in its possession or control that relate to the Theravance Compounds and return to Theravance, or destroy at Theravance's request, all relevant records and materials in its possession or control containing Confidential Information of Theravance (provided that GSK may keep one copy of such Confidential Information of Theravance for archival purposes only in accordance with Section 10.1).   (b) GSK shall, at its sole expense, transfer to Theravance, or shall cause its designee(s) to transfer to Theravance, ownership of all regulatory filings made or filed for the Terminated Development Collaboration Product that contains a LABA as a single agent (to the extent that any are held in GSK's or such designee(s)'s name), such transfer to be as permitted by any Third Party licenses or other such prior rights and applicable Laws and regulations, otherwise GSK shall cooperate as necessary to permit Theravance to exercise its rights hereunder.   (c) Theravance shall have the non-exclusive right to access, use and cite in any regulatory filing any data relating to formulation of a LABA/ICS Combination Product or Other Combination Product.   (d) For such Terminated Development Collaboration Product (excluding the non-LABA component of a LABA/ICS Combination Product and/or Other Combination Product and GSK's Diskus delivery device and any information directed thereto), GSK shall grant to Theravance the appropriate licenses in the Territory under the GSK Patents, GSK Inventions and GSK Know- How related to the LABA compound, dry powder inhaler formulation, metered dose inhaler formulation, and metered dose inhaler device, as applicable, to enable Theravance to Develop and Commercialize the Terminated Development Collaboration Product in the Field.   44





  (e) In the event of a Change in Control of Theravance prior to termination by GSK under Section 14.3, none of the provisions under this Section 14.6.2 shall survive as they pertain to any Collaboration Product other than a Theravance compound as a single agent LABA.   14.6.3 Effect of Termination by GSK of a Terminated Commercialized Collaboration Product. The provisions of this Section 14.6.3 shall apply only where a Terminated Commercialised Collaboration Product is not being or has not been replaced by an alternative Collaboration Product under this Agreement and provided that, in GSK's reasonable good faith judgment, exercise by Theravance alone or with a Third Party of any of the rights or activities contemplated by this Section 14.6.3 (which such rights or activities shall include access to a GSK compound and/or GSK proprietary formulations or devices including Diskus, (collectively "GSK Property")) will not materially damage GSK's continued development, regulatory or commercial use of such GSK Property. GSK will use reasonable efforts to assist Theravance in locating a mutually acceptable Third Party to carry out the rights and activities contemplated by this Section 14.6.3. Subject to the foregoing:   (a) If GSK terminates a Collaboration Product after First Commercial Sale of such Collaboration Product in one or more of the Major Market Countries, Theravance shall have the right in its sole discretion and at its sole expense, for its own benefit or together with a Third Party, to commercialize such Terminated Commercialized Collaboration Product in any of such Major Market Countries where it has been terminated.   (b) If GSK terminates Commercialization of a Collaboration Product in all Countries of the Territory following the first commercial sale in any Country of the Territory, Theravance shall have the right in its sole discretion and at it sole expense, for its own benefit or together with a Third Party, to Commercialise such Terminated Commercialized Collaboration Product in the Territory.   (c) Subject to Section 14.6.3(a), GSK shall grant to Theravance the appropriate licenses in the Territory (or in the case of a Country-by-Country termination, in the relevant Countries) under the GSK Patents, GSK Inventions and GSK Know-How to enable Theravance by itself and/or through one or more Third Party sublicensees, to Commercialize the Terminated Commercialized Collaboration Product. GSK shall also provide Theravance with all such information and data which GSK, or its sublicensees reasonably have available in such Country, for example access to drug master file, clinical data and the like, and shall execute such instruments as Theravance reasonably requests, to enable Theravance to obtain the appropriate regulatory approvals to market such Terminated Commercialized Collaboration Product in such Country and for any other lawful purpose related to Commercialization of such Terminated Commercialized Collaboration Product in such Country.   (d) In the event Theravance exercises its rights under Section 14.6.3(a) and (b) above, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith a separate commercialization and supply agreement for such Terminated Commercialized Collaboration Product which shall ensure that, based on commercially reasonable terms   45





  (recognizing the Commercialized status of the Terminated Commercialized Collaboration Product), Theravance has a continuous and uninterrupted supply of such Terminated Commercialized Collaboration Product, for a suitable period of time to enable Theravance to secure Third Party supply.   (e) In the event of a Change in Control of Theravance, prior to termination by GSK under Section 14.4, none of the provisions under this Section 14.6.3 shall survive as they pertain to any Collaboration Product other than to a single agent LABA, its dry powder inhaler formulation, metered dose inhaler formulation, and metered dose inhaler device, as applicable; and the Parties will meet in good faith to explore other potential commercial options e.g. use of one or more Third Parties for possible continued Commercialisation of such Terminated Commercialised Collaboration Product if it is a LABA/ICS Combination Product or Other Combination Product.   (f) If GSK, in the exercise of its reasonable good faith judgment, determines that exercise by Theravance alone or with a Third Party of any of the rights or activities contemplated by this Section 14.6.3 will materially damage GSK's continued development, regulatory or commercial use of GSK Property, then GSK shall grant to Theravance, for such Terminated Commercialized Collaboration Product (excluding the non-LABA component of a Combination Product and/or Other Combination Product and GSK's Diskus delivery device and any information directed thereto), the appropriate licenses in the Territory under the GSK Patents, GSK Inventions and GSK Know-How related to the LABA compound, dry powder inhaler formulation, metered dose inhaler formulation, and metered dose inhaler device, as applicable, to enable Theravance to Commercialize a product containing the LABA Compound in the Field.   14.6.4 Effect of Termination of the Agreement Due to Discontinuation of Development Prior to First Commercial Sale of All Collaboration Products and All Pooled Compounds. In the event that the Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 14.5, the following shall occur:   (i) Return of Materials.

Theravance shall, at its sole expense, promptly transfer to GSK copies of all data, reports, records and materials in its possession or control that relate to the GSK Compounds and return to GSK, or destroy at GSK's request, all relevant records and materials in its possession or control containing Confidential Information of GSK (provided that Theravance may keep one copy of such Confidential Information of GSK for archival purposes only in accordance with Section 10.1).   (ii) Transfer of Regulatory Filings. GSK shall, at its sole expense, transfer to Theravance, or shall cause its designee(s) to transfer to Theravance, ownership of all regulatory filings made or filed for any Terminated Development Collaboration Product (to the extent that any are held in GSK's or such designee(s)'s name), but only where the Terminated Collaboration Product contains a Theravance Compound as a single agent and such transfer to be as permitted   46





  by applicable Laws and regulations. GSK, at its sole discretion, shall also give due consideration to transferring to Theravance any additional regulatory filings for a Terminated Development Collaboration Product which contains a Theravance Compound as a Combination Product.   (iii) License Rights. All licenses granted by Theravance to GSK with respect to the Collaboration Products under this Agreement shall terminate.   (iv) Stock Return. GSK shall return to Theravance all available formulated and API stocks that contain a Theravance Compound and which are then held by GSK or cause such API stocks to be provided to Theravance if held by a vendor or other Third Party on behalf of GSK.

Neither Party shall be obligated to make a Development Milestone payment under Section 6.2 which is triggered by an event occurring after the effective date of termination of this Agreement with respect to a Collaboration Product.   14.9 Subsequent Royalties. If after termination of this Agreement either Party subsequently Develops and Commercializes any Long- Acting β2 Adrenoceptor Agonist for the treatment / prophylaxis of respiratory diseases which (i) was never a Pooled Compound or Collaboration Product or (ii) was a GSK Discontinued Compound or a Theravance Discontinued Compound, it will pay to the other Party a royalty on Net Sales of any such products at the rate of 3% for a single-agent product and 2% for the first combination product for a period of 15 years from the date of launch on a Country-by-Country basis; provided, however, that this royalty shall not apply to any compound or product (including new product line extensions and/or re-formulation work) where the original compound or product is, as of the date of signature of this Agreement, already Commercialized.   14.10 Accrued Rights; Surviving Obligations. Termination, relinquishment or expiration of this Agreement for any reason shall be without prejudice to any rights that shall have accrued to the benefit of any Party prior to such termination, relinquishment or expiration. Such termination, relinquishment or expiration shall not relieve any Party from obligations which are expressly or by implication intended to survive termination, relinquishment or expiration of this Agreement, including without limitation Article 10, and shall not affect or prejudice any provision of this Agreement which is expressly or by implication provided to come into effect on, or continue in effect after, such termination, relinquishment or expiration.   47

This Agreement is not a partnership agreement and nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to establish a relationship of co-partners or joint venturers between the Parties.   16.2 Registration and Filing of This Agreement. To the extent, if any, that either Party concludes in good faith that it or the other Party is required to file or register this Agreement or a notification thereof with any Governmental Authority, including without limitation the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Competition Directorate of the Commission of the European Communities or the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, in accordance with Law, such Party shall inform the other Party thereof. Should both Parties jointly agree that either of them is required to submit or obtain any such filing, registration or notification, they shall cooperate, each at its own expense, in such filing, registration or notification and shall execute all documents reasonably required in connection therewith. In such filing, registration or notification, the Parties shall request confidential treatment of sensitive provisions of this Agreement, to the extent permitted by Law. The Parties shall promptly inform each other as to the activities or inquiries of any such Governmental Authority relating to this Agreement, and shall reasonably cooperate to respond to any request for further information there from on a timely basis.   16.3 Force Majeure. The occurrence of an event which materially interferes with the ability of a Party to perform its obligations or duties hereunder which is not within the reasonable control of the Party affected or any of its Affiliates, not due to malfeasance by such Party or its Affiliates, and which could not with the exercise of due diligence have been avoided (each, a "Force Majeure Event"), including, but not limited to, an injunction, order or action by a Governmental Authority, fire, accident, labor difficulty, strike, riot, civil commotion, act of God, inability to obtain raw materials, delay or errors by shipping companies or change in law, shall not excuse such Party from the performance of its obligations or duties under this Agreement, but shall merely suspend such performance during the continuation of the Force Majeure. The Party prevented from performing its obligations or duties because of a Force Majeure Event shall promptly notify the other Party of the occurrence and particulars of such Force Majeure and shall provide the other Party, from time to time, with its best estimate of the duration of such Force Majeure Event and with notice of the termination thereof. The Party so affected shall use Diligent Efforts to avoid or remove such causes of nonperformance as soon as is reasonably practicable. Upon termination of the Force Majeure Event, the performance of any suspended obligation or duty shall promptly recommence. The Party subject to the Force Majeure Event shall not be liable to the other Party for any direct, indirect, consequential, incidental, special, punitive, exemplary or other damages arising out of or relating to the suspension or termination of any of its obligations or duties under this Agreement by reason of the occurrence of a Force Majeure Event, provided such Party complies in all material respects with its obligations under this Section 16.3.   16.4 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be construed, and the respective rights of the Parties determined, according to the substantive law of the State of Delaware notwithstanding the provisions governing conflict of laws under such Delaware law to the contrary, except matters of intellectual property law which shall be determined in accordance with the intellectual property laws relevant to the intellectual property in question.   16.5 Attorneys' Fees and Related Costs. In the event that any legal proceeding is brought to enforce or interpret any of the provisions of this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs and expenses of litigation whether or not the action or proceeding proceeds to final judgment.   51





  16.6 Assignment. This Agreement may not be assigned by either Party without the prior written consent of the other Party; provided, however that either Party may assign this Agreement, in whole or in part, to any of its Affiliates if such Party guarantees the performance of this Agreement by such Affiliate; and provided further that either Party may assign this Agreement to a successor to all or substantially all of the assets of such Party whether by merger, sale of stock, sale of assets or other similar transaction. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and subject to the terms of the foregoing sentence, inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto, their permitted successors, legal representatives and assigns.   16.7 Notices.

  the validity of the remaining provisions of this Agreement. The Parties will replace an invalid provision or fill any gap with valid provisions which most closely approximate the purpose and economic effect of the invalid provision or, in case of a gap, the Parties' presumed intentions. In the event that the terms and conditions of this Agreement are materially altered as a result of the preceding sentences, the Parties shall renegotiate the terms and conditions of this Agreement in order to resolve any inequities. Nothing in this Agreement shall be interpreted so as to require either Party to violate any applicable laws, rules or regulations.   16.9 Headings.

Any term or condition of this Agreement may be waived at any time by the Party that is entitled to the benefit thereof, but no such waiver shall be effective unless set forth in a written instrument duly executed by or on behalf of the Party waiving such term or condition. No waiver by any Party of any term or condition of this Agreement, in any one or more instances, shall be deemed to be or construed as a waiver of the same or any other term or condition of this Agreement on any future occasion. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, all rights and remedies available to a Party, whether under this Agreement or afforded by law or otherwise, will be cumulative and not in the alternative to any other rights or remedies that may be available to such Party.   16.11 Entire Agreement.

None of the provisions of this Agreement shall be for the benefit of or enforceable by any Third Party, including without limitation any creditor of either Party hereto. No such Third Party shall obtain any right under any provision of this Agreement or shall by reasons of any such provision make any Claim in respect of any debt, liability or obligation (or otherwise) against either Party hereto.   16.14 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any two counterparts, each of which, when executed, shall be deemed to be an original and both of which together shall constitute one and the same document.   53





  16.15 Single Closing Condition. The obligation of each Party to consummate the transaction contemplated hereby is subject to the satisfaction of the following condition (the "Closing Condition"): All filings under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and any other similar competition or merger control laws that are necessary in any jurisdiction with respect to the transaction contemplated hereby shall have been made and any required waiting period under such laws shall have expired or been terminated and any Governmental Authority that has power under or authority to enforce such laws shall have, if applicable, approved, cleared or decided neither to initiate proceedings or otherwise intervene in respect of the transaction contemplated hereby nor to refer the transaction to any other competent Governmental Authority. Each Party shall use good faith efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other party in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the transaction contemplated by this Agreement, including, but not limited to satisfaction of the Closing Condition and each Party shall keep the other Party reasonably apprised of the status of matters relating to the completion of same. In connection with the foregoing, the Parties hereby agree to negotiate in good faith to make as soon as practicable any modification or amendment to this Agreement or any agreement related hereto that is required by the United States Federal Trade Commission, Department of Justice or equivalent Governmental Authority, provided that no Party shall be required to agree to any modification or amendment that, in the reasonable opinion of such Party's external legal or financial counsel, would be adverse to such Party. This Agreement may be terminated by either Party upon written notice any time after June 1, 2003 if the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall not have been consummated by June 1, 2003 due to failure to satisfy the Closing Condition; provided, however, that the terminating Party shall not have breached in any material respect its obligations under this Agreement in any manner that shall have been the proximate cause of, or resulted in, the failure to satisfy the Closing Condition or otherwise to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by such date.   54

  Schedule 1.19   Criteria for Theravance New Compounds and Replacement Compounds   1. Single optical isomer, which is patentable. 2. Potency in vitro and in vivo compatible with potential to develop in a DPI device. 3. Intrinsic agonist activity not less than that of salmeterol. 4. Selectivity at β adrenoceptors, relative to β and β  adrenoceptors, similar or superior to that of formoterol, assessed in assays determining equi- potent molar ratios relative to that of isoprenaline (isoproterenol). 5. Selectivity at non-β adrenoceptors >100. 6. No significant inhibition of the hERG potassium channel at a concentration at least 30 fold greater than the anticipated therapeutic maximum concentration in plasma. 7. Duration of agonist activity in vivo to be clearly longer than that of salmeterol. This would be at least 72 hours in the Theravance model. The exact duration criterion for either the GSK or the Theravance model might be modified in the light of forthcoming clinical data from the program. 8. Stable compound suitable for formulation to pursue FTIM studies, with crystalline form identified. 9. Oral bioavailability to be less than 10% in the rat and less than 25% in the dog. 10.
