2. Research Program.

2.1 Performance. The Parties will diligently perform their respective activities set forth in the Research Plan (such activities, collectively, the "Research Program") in accordance with the timelines set forth therein, with the objective of identifying Hit Compounds and Lead Scaffolds that modulate the applicable Target. Without limiting the foregoing, OntoChem will (a) provide all deliverables set forth in the Research Plan (each, a "Deliverable") and (b) obtain any authorizations, approvals and licenses required for performance of the Research Plan. If any terms set forth in the Research Plan conflict with the terms set forth in this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement will control unless expressly indicated to the contrary in the Research Plan. The Research Plan may not be amended without the prior written consent of both Parties. If, from time to time, the Parties desire to expand the scope of the Research Program, then they will negotiate in good faith a potential amendment of the Research Plan in regard to such expanded scope, on commercially reasonable terms, but neither Party will be obligated to enter into any such amendment.

2.2 Weekly Updates. OntoChem will provide Anixa with weekly (or more frequently as requested) updates regarding its progress under the Research Program via teleconference, videoconference or e-mail, and the Parties will make appropriate personnel available in a timely manner to discuss and provide feedback in regard to such updates.

2.3 Delivery of Data. In conjunction with each weekly update described in Section 2.2, OntoChem will deliver to Anixa all data generated under the Research Plan since the preceding update. In addition, Anixa will have the right to reasonably request additional information relating to such data, and OntoChem will respond to such requests promptly with any such additional information in its possession or control, provided that, for clarity, OntoChem will not be required to perform any new or additional research in order to generate any such additional information.

2.4 Selection of Lead Scaffolds. Within one year following completion of all activities under the Research Plan (the "Selection Deadline"), Anixa, in good faith consultation with OntoChem, will have the right to select up to two hundred (200) Hit Compounds (each, a "Selected Hit Compound"), by providing OntoChem with written notice of such Selected Hit Compound(s) (the "Selection Notice"), and each Selected Hit Compound, along with all Variants of such Selected Hit Compound referenced in the Selection Notice, is hereby designated as a "Lead Scaffold" under this Agreement. Commencing upon selection of a Selected Hit Compound, Anixa (itself and through its Affiliates and designees) will have sole authority over and control of the further development, manufacture, and commercialization of the corresponding Lead Scaffold and any product candidate or product incorporating a compound from such Lead Scaffold. Following the Selection Deadline, Anixa will have no further rights with respect to any Hit Compound that is not a Selected Hit Compound or included within a Lead Scaffold (each, a "Rejected Hit Compound"), provided that, during the period of two (2) years following the Selection Deadline, neither OntoChem nor any of its Affiliates will use or disclose to any third party any Rejected Hit Compound or any Variant thereof, including the identity, structure or SAR information of any such compound, for application as anti-viral agents or protease inhibitors, for purposes of modulating any Target or for treatment of virus-related conditions. In case OntoChem finds a novel and unexpected antiviral use of those Rejected Hit Compounds during this 2-years period, it will notify Anixa about these findings and Anixa has the right of first negotiation during a period of 6 months after this notification. If Anixa decides to not license those uses or compounds for this novel antiviral use, OntoChem is free to develop those molecules further as its own intellectual property without any further restrictions.

2.5 Subcontractors. OntoChem may engage one or more subcontractors to perform its activities under the Research Plan with the prior written approval of Anixa and provided that, with respect to any such subcontractor, OntoChem will (a) be responsible and liable for the performance of such subcontractor and (b) enter into a written agreement (i) consistent with terms and conditions of this Agreement, including with respect to confidentiality and intellectual property, and (ii) prohibiting such subcontractor from further subcontracting. For clarity, vendors where commercial building blocks or compounds will be purchased are nor regarded as subcontractors.

2.6 Target Exclusivity. During the term of this Agreement, except in the performance of its obligations or exercise of its rights under this Agreement, neither OntoChem nor any of its Affiliates will discover, research, develop, manufacture or commercialize any compound or product directed to any Target, either independently or for or in collaboration with a third party (including the grant of a license to any third party), or have any of the foregoing activities performed on behalf of OntoChem or any of its Affiliates by a third party. For clarity, the foregoing includes the screening (including via computational methods) of any compound library or virtual compound library against any Target.

2.7 Records. Each Party will maintain complete and accurate records of all activities performed by or on behalf of such Party under the Research Program and all Inventions made or generated by or on behalf of such Party in the performance of the Research Program. Such records will be in sufficient detail and in good scientific manner appropriate for patent and regulatory purposes. Each Party will provide the other Party with the right to inspect such records, and upon request will provide copies of all such records, to the extent reasonably required for the exercise or performance of such other Party's rights or obligations under this Agreement, provided that any information disclosed under this Section 2.7 will be subject to the terms and conditions of Section 5. Each Party will retain such records for at least three (3) years following expiration or termination of this Agreement or such longer period as may be required by applicable law or regulation.
