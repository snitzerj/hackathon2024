7.7. Cost Calculation Process and Review. [*], IAC and Sonos shall meet to review any changes that have occurred in the total cost for each Product since the prior review and according to the cost model formula described in Exhibit G. [*].

7.8. Purchase Price Variance (PPV). Consistent with Section 6.4 of this Agreement, Sonos and IAC shall compare the cost model formula results between the invoiced pricing for Products [*] and the actual cost data that applied to the formula for the period. [*] Additionally, IAC and Sonos may agree to settle other costs that are incurred [*] in the next PPV calculation. Based on the results of the PPV calculation, the Parties will execute a credit or debit (positive or negative) memo for the entire Purchase Price Variance amount to be applied against the next payment(s) made by Sonos. IAC agrees to provide Sonos with any requested documentation relevant to the PPV calculation, including but not limited to copies of invoices from Components suppliers.

7.9. Component Procurement, Supply Management, Component Buffer Inventory, and Excess Components. Sonos desires to empower IAC to place Component purchase orders and otherwise manage the Component supply chain necessary to execute the on-time manufacture and shipment of Products. IAC shall be responsible to maintain accurate and up to date Component Lead Times and cancellation terms for all Components required to manufacture Products, and to place purchase orders for all Components according to Component Lead Times and the most recent Sonos Purchase Orders and Rolling Forecast. For Components that more than one supplier is qualified for usage in Products ("multi-sourced Components"), IAC shall execute Component purchase orders according to the volume share instruction given by Sonos. For such multi-sourced Components, IAC and Sonos shall agree to a process to, on [*], review and revise according to Sonos' instruction the purchase order volume share to be placed by IAC between qualified Component suppliers. In the event of a change in quantities of Products in a Sonos Purchase Order or Rolling Forecast, IAC shall respond quickly to adjust its purchase orders for all Components and to confirm revised supply plans with all Component suppliers. Within [*] of receiving a new Sonos Rolling Forecast, IAC shall review Product manufacturing capacity and Component availability and provide Sonos a written shipment commitment plan (including shipment quantities by date).

[*]. In the event Sonos instructs IAC to scrap any Components, IAC shall notify Sonos at least twenty-four (24) hours in advance of scrapping the Components and Sonos reserves the right to witness such scrap.

7.9.1. Component Buffer Inventory. IAC agrees to maintain [*] of buffer inventory for Components to support possible short lead time increases in Product quantities. The [*] of Component inventory is IAC's responsibility to manage, and can be achieved through any one of the following methods: 1) [*] 2) [*] 3) [*]

The Component buffer inventory amount shall be calculated by [*]. As this [*] increases or decreases, IAC will manage the Component buffer inventory up or down as required. All Component inventories will be utilized by IAC for the manufacture of Products on a [*] basis. For Component buffer inventory stored at a Component supplier factory, Sonos and IAC shall develop a process to regularly validate that the correct levels of Component buffer inventory are in fact in place. [*]. As a Product approaches end of life, Sonos will instruct IAC in writing to reduce or eliminate all Component buffer inventories in order to minimize the risk of an Excess Component occurrence.

7.9.2. Clear to Build Reporting. On a [*] basis and covering at least [*] of the then-current Sonos Rolling Forecast, IAC shall provide Sonos with a written "Clear to Build" report for each Product. This report shall include each Component required for that Product and incorporate each Component supplier's supply commitment to IAC. The report shall compare the supplier supply commitments to IAC's Component requirements in order to meet the current Rolling Forecast. While the detailed format of the report will be agreed between Sonos and IAC, the intent of the Clear to Build report is to proactively highlight potential Component supply shortages so that they can be resolved in advance of becoming an impact to IAC's manufacture of Products. IAC agrees, if requested by Sonos, to publish an updated Clear to Build report more frequently than [*] during periods where significant Component shortage risks are present.

7.9.3. Component Discontinuance Purchase. In the event IAC or Sonos receives a manufacture discontinuance or end of life notice for a Component and the Component being discontinued does not have a replacement or substitute approved by Sonos prior to the last time buy date from the manufacturer, IAC agrees to purchase and store such discontinued Component during the term of this Agreement at a quantity specified in writing by Sonos and a Sonos PO is placed on IAC for the specified Component quantity. [*].

16.0 MISCELLANEOUS.

16.1. Force Majeure. Except for the obligation to make payments herein, neither party shall be liable for delays in delivery or performance of its obligations, or for failure to deliver or perform its obligations under this Agreement due to a cause or circumstances beyond its reasonable control, including, without limitation, an act of nature, act of civil, government, or military authority, act of terrorism, governmental priority, strike or other labor disturbance, flood, fire, explosion, epidemic, other hostilities, or failure of the Internet (not resulting from the actions or inactions of such party). For clarification purposes, an industry wide inability to obtain a Third Party Component is a force majeure event; however, all other material shortages shall not be considered force majeure events. The party claiming excuse because of force majeure shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to promptly correct such failure or delay in performance and shall promptly notify the other party to this Agreement of any delay or failure to perform which may be excused by this provision, which notification will also specify the expected date of resumption of performance. In the event of any such delay, the date of performance shall be extended for a period equal to the time lost by reason of the delay. If, however, either party is unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement for reasons excused by this provision for a period in excess of ninety (90) consecutive days, the other party may terminate this Agreement without penalty upon written notice to the other Party.

16.5. Notices. Any notice required or permitted to be given by any party under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be personally delivered or sent by a reputable overnight mail service (e.g., Federal Express), or by first class mail (certified or registered), or by facsimile confirmed by first class mail (registered or certified), to the Program Manager of the other party.

The rights and liabilities of the parties under this Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties' respective successors and permitted assigns.

16.7. Waiver and Modification. Failure by any party to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision. Any waiver, amendment or other modification of any provision of this Agreement will be effective only if in writing and signed by the parties.

16.8. Construction. The Parties agree that any principle of construction or rule of law that provides that an agreement shall be construed against the drafter of the agreement in the event of any inconsistency or ambiguity in such agreement shall not apply to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Titles and headings to articles and sections of this Agreement are inserted for convenience of reference only and are not intended to affect the interpretation or construction of this Agreement.

16.9. Severability. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this Agreement to be unenforceable, that provision of the Agreement will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to affect the intent of the parties, and the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect.

16.10. Dispute Settlement; Governing Law.

Exhibit F

Sonos Supplier Performance Review F.1 Introduction.

Sonos supplier management strategy is based on developing strong working relationships with its suppliers. The results Sonos seek will not occur from random sourcing or selecting suppliers solely on competitive quotations. It will result from working closely with the best existing suppliers to improve quality, productivity, cost, and all other elements of supplier performance.

The basic strategy entails establishing mutual performance expectations and metrics, providing supplier performance feedback, initiating corrective actions to ensure continuous improvements, and rewarding the best suppliers with the opportunity for future new business. The Sonos Supplier Performance Review program provides a framework for effective communication between Sonos and its suppliers regarding the specific elements of supplier performance. The result of establishing our expectations and supplier performance feedback will ensure maximum customer satisfaction and increased profitability for all contributors to the system. To accomplish these objectives, Sonos aims to: • Establish and strengthen long-term partnerships that result in mutual success between the Parties • Set expectations and metrics that are aggressive yet realistic and achievable • Utilize a team approach to achieve performance improvements • Be open to 2-way feedback and commit ourselves to continuous improvement, just as we expect from our supply and manufacturing partners

Successful supplier performance in the areas of Quality, Business, Engineering, Supply Chain & Operational Excellence is expected and necessary for both parties to achieve repeat business, increased sales and profitable growth. F.2 Supplier Performance Review Metrics.

IAC must maintain a competitive advantage by providing products of the highest quality and a competitive total cost, with operations that demonstrate best in class manufacturing, quality, engineering and supply chain innovation and execution. The Parties will mutually agree in good faith upon valid performance metrics, goals, and a relevant scoring template and process.

The Parties agree to meet [*] to review IAC's performance and scoring for the period. It is targeted to alternate meeting locations between Sonos' USA HQ office and IAC's factory. Dates and locations for such reviews will be agreed between the Parties with reasonable notice. Page 35 of 38 *Confidential Treatment Requested
