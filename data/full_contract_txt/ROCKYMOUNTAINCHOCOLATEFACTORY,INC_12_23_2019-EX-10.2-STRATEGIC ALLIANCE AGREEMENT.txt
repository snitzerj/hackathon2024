Subject to, and only upon the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in, this Section 4.1 and Section 4.5, the Company shall cause the Director Designee to be (x) nominated for election to the Board of Directors and included in the Board of Director's slate of nominees recommended to the shareholders of the Company for each election of directors, and recommend to the shareholders of the Company that the Director Designee be elected to the Board of Directors and (y) included in the proxy statement (if any) prepared by management of the Company in connection with soliciting proxies for every meeting of the shareholders of the Company called with respect to the election of members of the Board of Directors, and at every adjournment or postponement thereof, and on every action or approval by written consent of the shareholders of the Company or the Board of Directors with respect to the election of members of the Board of Directors. When applicable pursuant to Section 4.1 and Section 4.5, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the election of the Director Designee and otherwise support the Director Designee for election in a manner no less rigorous and favorable than the manner in which the Company supports, and has historically supported, its other nominees in the aggregate. Except as otherwise required by applicable Law, the Company shall not take any action to cause the removal without cause of the Director Designee, unless it is directed to do so by the Farids Group. 12





Section 4.3 Eligibility of Director Designee. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Article IV, the Company shall not be obligated to cause to be nominated for election to the Board of Directors (or to be included in the Board of Directors' slate of nominees to the Company's stockholders or any proxy statement prepared by management of the Company in connection with soliciting proxies for meetings of the stockholders of the Company called with respect to the election of members of the Board of Directors) or recommend to the Company's stockholders the election of the Director Designee in the event that (i) the Director Designee fails to satisfy all applicable requirements (other than those relating to independence) regarding qualifying as a director of the Company under (A) Nasdaq rules (or the rules of the principal market on which shares of Common Stock are then listed) regarding service as a director and (B) applicable Law; (ii) the Director Designee has been involved in any of the events enumerated in Item 2(d) or (e) of Schedule 13D under the Exchange Act, (iii) the Director Designee is currently the target of an investigation by any governmental authority or agency relating to felonious criminal activity or is subject to any order, decree, or judgment of any court or agency prohibiting service as a director of any public company or providing investment or financial advisory services or (iv) the Director Designee has declared or otherwise indicated (whether publicly or to the Company or the Board of Directors) that she or he is unwilling or unable to serve as a director or otherwise takes actions inconsistent with her or his election. If any event described in clause (i) through (iv) of the preceding sentence occurs, (x) if the Director Designee is TF, then the Farids Group shall forfeit its rights under this Agreement to designate the Director Designee as a member of the Board of Director and shall not have any right to a replacement designee and (y) if the Director Designee is an individual other than TF, then the TF Group shall designate a replacement designee who shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company and shall satisfy the eligibility requirements set forth in this Section 4.3 and such replacement designee shall thereafter constitute a "Director Designee" under this Agreement. The Company shall promptly notify the Farids Group in writing of any objection to the Director Designee in advance of the date on which proxy materials are mailed by the Company in connection with such election of directors.

ARTICLE V RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER Section 5.1 Restrictions on Transfer. (a) Until the second anniversary of the Closing Date, the Farids Group agrees not to make any Transfer of all or any portion of the Purchased Shares, except that the Farids Group shall be permitted to make Permitted Transfers. (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Farids Group agrees that it will not effect any Transfer of Purchased Shares unless such Transfer is made pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act or pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and, in either case, in compliance with all applicable state securities laws and all applicable securities laws of any other jurisdiction. The Company agrees, and the Farids Group understands and consents, that the Company will not take any action to cause or permit the Transfer of any Purchased Shares to be made on its books (or on any register of securities maintained on its behalf) unless the Transfer is permitted by and has been made in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and all applicable securities laws. The Farids Group agrees that in connection with any Transfer of Purchased Shares that is not made pursuant to a registration statement, the Company may, in its sole discretion, request an opinion, certifications and other information in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company and from counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Company stating that such transaction is exempt from registration under the Securities Act. (c) The Purchased Shares shall be stamped or otherwise imprinted with legends substantially similar to the following (in addition to any legend required under applicable state securities laws) or if held in electronic form, shall be held in an account by the Company's stock transfer agent subject to restrictions on Transfer substantially consistent with the following legend, which shall be furnished in accordance with applicable Law: THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED HEREBY HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE "ACT"), AND MAY NOT BE OFFERED, SOLD OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED, ASSIGNED, PLEDGED OR HYPOTHECATED EXCEPT (A) PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE ACT COVERING ANY SUCH TRANSACTION OR (B) PURSUANT TO AN EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION THEREUNDER, SUBJECT TO THE COMPANY'S RIGHT TO RECEIVE AN OPINION OF COUNSEL, CERTIFICATIONS AND OTHER INFORMATION IN FORM AND SUBSTANCE REASONABLY SATISFACTORY TO THE COMPANY AND FROM COUNSEL REASONABLY SATISFACTORY TO THE COMPANY STATING THAT SUCH TRANSACTION IS EXEMPT FROM SUCH REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS. 14





THE SALE, PLEDGE, HYPOTHECATION OR TRANSFER OF THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE IS SUBJECT TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF A CERTAIN STRATEGIC ALLIANCE AGREEMENT DATED AS OF DECEMBER 20, 2019, AMONG FARIDS & CO. LLC, EDIBLE ARRANGEMENTS, LLC AND THE COMPANY (AS THE SAME MAY BE AMENDED AND IN EFFECT FROM TIME TO TIME). NO SALE, PLEDGE, HYPOTHECATION OR TRANSFER OF THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE MAY BE MADE EXCEPT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF SUCH STRATEGIC ALLIANCE AGREEMENT. COPIES OF SUCH AGREEMENT MAY BE OBTAINED UPON WRITTEN REQUEST TO THE SECRETARY OF THE COMPANY. (d) The Farids Group acknowledges and agrees that any Transfer of the limited liability company interests, partnership interests, shares or other similar equity interests in any member of the Farids Group or a parent entity of such member will be deemed to constitute a Transfer of Purchased Shares, and any proposed Transfer of all or any portion of any such interests in any member of the Farids Group or a parent entity of such member shall be subject to compliance with the terms of this Agreement as such terms apply to the Farids Group. (e) The Company acknowledges and agrees that the Farids Group may from time to time pledge, and/or grant a security interest in, some or all of the legended Purchased Shares in connection with applicable securities laws, pursuant to a bona fide margin agreement in compliance with a bona fide margin loan. Such a pledge would not be subject to approval or consent of the Company and no legal opinion of legal counsel to the pledgee, secured party or pledgor shall be required in connection with the pledge, but such legal opinion shall be required in connection with a subsequent transfer or foreclosure following default by the Farids Group transferee of the pledge. No notice shall be required of such pledge, but the Farids Group's transferee shall promptly notify the Company of any such subsequent transfer or foreclosure. The Farids Group acknowledges that the Company shall not be responsible for any pledges relating to, or the grant of any security interest in, any of the Purchased Shares or for any agreement, understanding or arrangement between the Farids Group and its pledgee or secured party. At the Farids Group's expense, the Company will execute and deliver such reasonable documentation as a pledgee or secured party of Purchased Shares may reasonably request in connection with a pledge or transfer of the Purchased Shares, including the preparation and filing of any required prospectus supplement under Rule 424(b)(3) of the Securities Act or other applicable provision of the Securities Act to appropriately amend the list of selling stockholders thereunder. (f) The legend set forth in Section 5.1(c) above shall be removed and the Company shall issue one or more certificates without such legend or any other legend to the holder of the Purchased Shares upon which it is stamped or issue to such holder by electronic delivery, if (i) such Purchased Shares are registered for resale under the Securities Act, (ii) such Purchased Shares are sold or transferred pursuant to Rule 144, or (iii) such Purchased Shares are eligible for resale under the Securities Act without regard to current public information, manner of sale or volume limitations. Any fees (with respect to the Company's transfer agent, Company counsel or otherwise) associated with the removal of such legend shall be borne by the Company. 15





Section 5.2 Remedy for Prohibited Transfer. In the event that any member of the Farids Group Transfers any Purchased Shares in contravention of Section 5.1, such Transfer shall be null and void, and the Company agrees it will not take any action to effect such a Transfer nor will it treat any alleged transferee as the holder of such Purchased Shares. ARTICLE VI REGISTRATION RIGHTS Section 6.1 Demand Registration. (a) If the Company shall receive a written request (a "Demand Request") from the Farids Group that the Company file a registration statement under the Securities Act covering the registration of all or a portion of the Registrable Securities owned by the Farids Group, then the Company shall, subject to the limitations of this Section 6.1, effect, as expeditiously as reasonably possible, the registration under the Securities Act of all Registrable Securities in accordance with the intended method of distribution thereof that the Farids Group requests to be registered, subject to the provisions of Section 6.1(c); provided, however, that any Eligible Resale Registration Statement shall be filed within 90 days following receipt of such Demand Request and any Resale Shelf Registration Statement shall be filed within 30 days following receipt of such Demand Request, as applicable. The Farids Group shall have the right to make two (2) Demand Requests on or after the date that is the second anniversary of the date of this Agreement; provided, that the Farids Group shall not make more than one (1) Demand Request within any six-month period. (b) If the Farids Group intends to distribute the Registrable Securities covered by its request by means of an underwritten public offering, it shall so advise the Company as a part of their request made pursuant to this Section 6.1. The Farids Group shall have the right to select the investment bank or banks and managers to administer any offering made in connection with a Demand Request, including the lead managing underwriter; provided that such investment banks or managers shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company; provided, further, that if the Farids Group declines to exercise such right, the Company shall select the investment bank or banks and managers to administer the offering, but the Farids Group shall continue to have such right pursuant to this Section 6.1(b) in any subsequent underwritten public offering. (c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall not be obligated to (i) effect a registration pursuant to Section 6.1 unless the Registrable Securities requested to be registered by the Farids Group, together with all other shares of Common Stock requested to be registered by any other holder of piggyback registration rights (each, an "Other Piggyback Holder") pursuant to any agreement containing similar registration rights as those contained in this Article VI (such other shares, the "Other Registrable Securities"), are reasonably expected to result in aggregate gross cash proceeds in excess of (x) in the case of a Resale Shelf Registration Statement, three (3) million dollars ($3,000,000) and (y) in the case of any other form of registration statement, one (1) million dollars ($1,000,000) or (ii) prepare, file, effect or maintain a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (or any successor to Form S-3) or any similar shelf registration statement (other than a Resale Shelf Registration Statement) under the Securities Act for the purposes of compliance with any Demand Right pursuant to this Section 6.1. 16





Section 6.2 Piggyback Registrations. (a) From and after the second anniversary of the date of this Agreement, the Company shall notify the Farids Group (unless the Farids Group has demanded such registration pursuant to Section 6.1) in writing at least five (5) business days prior to the initial public filing of any Eligible Registration Statement. Such notice from the Company shall state the intended method of distribution of the Registrable Securities included in such Eligible Registration Statement. The Company shall afford the Farids Group the opportunity to include Registrable Securities in such Eligible Registration Statement so long as it agrees to sell its Registrable Securities pursuant to the same method of distribution. If the Farids Group desires to include Registrable Securities held by it in any such Eligible Registration Statement, it shall, within four (4) business days after the above-described notice from the Company, so notify the Company in writing. Any such notice from the Farids Group shall (i) specify the amount of Registrable Securities that the Farids Group would like to include in such Eligible Registration Statement and (ii) include the agreement of the Farids Group to participate in any related underwritten offering on the same terms as the other participating Holders. Upon such written notice from the Farids Group, the Company will use its best efforts to effect the registration under the Securities Act of all Registrable Securities which the Farids Group has requested to be registered. If the Farids Group decides not to or is unable to include all of its Registrable Securities in any Eligible Registration Statement filed by the Company, the Farids Group shall nevertheless continue to have the right to include Registrable Securities in any subsequent Eligible Registration Statement as may be filed by the Company, all upon the terms and conditions set forth herein. Prior to the effectiveness of the applicable Eligible Registration Statement, the Farids Group may withdraw from such Eligible Registration Statement any of the Registrable Securities at any time upon written notice to the Company. (b) Underwriting. If the Eligible Registration Statement under which the Company gives notice under this Section 6.2 is for an underwritten offering, the Company shall so advise the Farids Group. In such event, the right of the Farids Group to be included in an Eligible Registration Statement pursuant to this Section 6.2 shall be conditioned upon the Farids Group's participation in such underwriting by executing and delivering a custody agreement and power of attorney in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company with respect to such Registrable Securities (the "Custody Agreement and Power of Attorney"), which Custody Agreement and Power of Attorney shall permit the Farids Group to, prior to the effectiveness of such Eligible Registration Statement, withdraw any of the Registrable Securities at any time from such Eligible Registration Statement upon written notice to the Company and the custodian. The Custody Agreement and Power of Attorney will provide, among other things, that (i) the Farids Group will, to the extent applicable, deliver to and deposit in custody with the custodian and attorney-in-fact named therein one or more certificates representing such Registrable Securities, accompanied by duly executed stock powers in blank, and irrevocably appoint said custodian and attorney-in-fact with full power and authority to act under the Custody Agreement and Power of Attorney on the Farids Group's behalf with respect to the matters specified therein, including, but not limited to, the entry into an underwriting agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement"") in customary form with the underwriter(s) and such other documents and agreements reasonably required in connection with such registration or offering and (ii) the Farids Group will perform its obligations under such Underwriting Agreement and any other agreement entered into in connection with such registration and/or offering. The Farids Group also agrees to execute such other documents and agreements as the Company may reasonably request to effect the provisions of this Section 6.2 and any transactions contemplated hereby. 17





Section 6.3 Priority on Registrations. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article VI, if the lead managing underwriter or underwriters advise, in the case of a requested registration pursuant to Section 6.1, the Farids Group or, in all other cases, the Company that marketing factors (including, but not limited to, an adverse effect on the per share offering price) require a limitation of the number of shares to be included in an underwritten offering (including Registrable Securities), then the Farids Group or the Company, as the case may be, shall so advise all holders of Registrable Securities and all Other Piggyback Holders who have requested to participate in such offering, that (i) if the requested registration is pursuant to Section 6.1, the number of shares that may be included in the underwriting shall be allocated first to the Farids Group for its own account, and second to the Company (to the extent it is selling shares of Common Stock in such offering) and the Other Piggyback Holders who have duly requested shares to be included therein on a pro rata basis based on the number of shares proposed to be sold by the Company and the number of Other Registrable Securities requested to be included by such Other Piggyback Holders, and (ii) if the requested registration is not pursuant to Section 6.1, the number of shares that may be included in the underwriting shall be allocated first to the Company for its own account (to the extent such registration was initiated by the Company) or to such Holder of Other Registrable Securities who demanded such registration pursuant to demand rights similar to those set forth in this Agreement, and second to the Company (to the extent such registration was not initiated by the Company), the Farids Group and the Other Piggyback Holders who have duly requested shares to be included therein on a pro rata basis based on the number of shares proposed to be sold by the Company (to the extent such registration was not initiated by the Company), the number of Registrable Securities requested to be included by the Farids Group and the number of Other Registrable Securities requested to be included by all such Other Piggyback Holders. For any Other Piggyback Holder which is a partnership, limited liability company or corporation, the partners, members or shareholders, as applicable, of such Other Piggyback Holder and the estates and Family Members of any such partners, members and shareholders and any trusts for the benefit of any of the foregoing Person(s) shall be deemed to be a single "Other Piggyback Holder," and any pro rata reduction with respect to such "Other Piggyback Holder" pursuant to this Section 6.3 shall be based upon the aggregate amount of shares carrying registration rights owned by all Persons deemed to constitute such "Other Piggyback Holder" (as defined in this sentence). Section 6.4 Termination, Effectiveness, Postponement and Suspension of Registration. (a) Right to Terminate Registration. If the Farids Group determines for any reason not to proceed with any proposed registration requested pursuant to Section 6.1, the Farids Group shall promptly notify the Company in writing. Upon receipt of such notice, the Company shall withdraw or terminate such registration whether or not any Other Piggyback Holder has elected to include any Other Registrable Securities in such registration. In addition, the Company shall have the right to withdraw or terminate any proposed registration initiated by it and a Holder of Other Registrable Securities shall have the right to withdraw or terminate any proposed registration initiated by it, whether or not the Farids Group or any Other Piggyback Holder has elected to include Registrable Securities or Other Registrable Securities, as the case may be, in such registration. The Company shall promptly give notice of the withdrawal or termination of any registration to the Farids Group, to the extent the Farids Group has elected to participate in such registration. The Registration Expenses of any such withdrawn or terminated registration shall be borne by the Company in accordance with Section 6.5. 18





(b) Effectiveness of the Registration Statement. The Company shall maintain the effectiveness of the Eligible Registration Statement until the earlier of (i) the date on which all Registrable Securities included in such Eligible Registration Statement have actually been sold and (ii) the date that is (x) 180 days (in respect of a Resale Shelf Registration Statement) or (y) 90 days (in respect of any Eligible Registration Statement other than a Resale Shelf Registration Statement) from the effective date of such Eligible Registration Statement. (c) Postponement or Suspension of Registration. If the filing, initial effectiveness or continued use of an Eligible Registration Statement in respect of a registration pursuant to this Agreement at any time would require the Company to make a public disclosure of material non-public information, (1) which disclosure in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors (after consultation with external legal counsel) (x) would be required to be made in any registration statement so that such registration statement would not contain a material misstatement or omission, (y) would not be required by applicable Law to be made at such time but for the filing, effectiveness or continued use of such Eligible Registration Statement and (z) would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or a material adverse effect on the Company's ability to effect a material proposed acquisition, disposition, financing, business opportunity, reorganization, recapitalization or similar transaction or (2) during a customary "blackout" period of the Company, then the Company may, upon giving prompt written notice of such determination to the Farids Group, delay the filing or initial effectiveness of, or suspend the use of, such Eligible Registration Statement; provided, that the Company shall not be permitted to do so pursuant to clause (1) above (x) more than two times during any twelve (12) month period or (y) for a period exceeding thirty (30) days on any one occasion (unless a longer period is consented to by the Farids Group) (the "Suspension Period"). In the event the Company exercises its rights under the preceding sentence, the Farids Group agrees to suspend, promptly upon its receipt of the notice referred to above, its use of any prospectus relating to such registration in connection with any sale or offer to sell Registrable Securities. If so requested by the Company, the Farids Group shall use its reasonable best efforts to deliver to the Company (at the Company's expense) all copies, other than permanent file copies then in the Farids Group's possession, of the prospectus relating to such Registrable Securities at the time of receipt of such notice. The Company agrees that, in the event it exercises its rights under this Section 6.4(c), it shall (i) promptly notify the Farids Group of the termination or expiration of any Suspension Period, (ii) within thirty (30) days after delivery of the notice referred to above (unless a longer period is consented to by the Farids Group), resume the process of filing or request for effectiveness, or update the suspended registration statement, as the case may be, as may be necessary to permit the Farids Group to offer and sell its Registrable Securities in accordance with applicable Law and (iii) if an Eligible Registration Statement that was already effective had been suspended as result of the exercise of such rights by the Company, promptly notify the Farids Group after the termination or expiration of any Suspension Period of the applicable time period during which the Eligible Registration Statement is to remain effective, which shall be extended by a period of time equal to the duration of the Suspension Period. 19





Section 6.5 Expenses of Registration. Except as specifically provided herein, all Registration Expenses incurred in connection with any registration under Sections 6.1 and 6.2 shall be borne by the Company. All underwriting fees and selling commissions relating to the distribution of the Registrable Securities and all taxes, if any, on the transfer and sale, respectively, of the Registrable Securities being sold that are incurred in connection with any registrations hereunder shall be borne by the Farids Group. For the avoidance of doubt, all underwriting fees, selling commissions and taxes incurred in connection with any registration hereunder relating to securities sold by the Company shall be borne by the Company. Section 6.6 Obligations of the Company. If and whenever the Company is required to effect the registration of any Registrable Securities under the Securities Act as provided in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 (to the extent the Farids Group has requested to include Registrable Securities in an Eligible Registration Statement pursuant to clause (a) of such Section 6.1 or 6.2, as the case may be), the Company shall effect such registration to permit the sale of such Registrable Securities in accordance with the intended method or methods of distribution thereof, and pursuant thereto the Company shall cooperate in the sale of the securities and shall, as expeditiously as reasonably possible: (a) Prepare and file with the SEC an Eligible Registration Statement on such form as shall be available for the sale of the Registrable Securities by the Farids Group in accordance with the intended method of distribution thereof and the provisions of this Article VI, and use its reasonable best efforts to cause each such Eligible Registration Statement to become effective and remain effective as provided herein; provided, however, that before filing any Eligible Registration Statement or Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto (not including documents that would be incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference), the Company shall afford the Farids Group, its counsel and the managing underwriter, if any, an opportunity to review copies of all such documents proposed to be filed. The Company shall not file any Eligible Registration Statement or Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto in respect of which the Farids Group has a right to review prior to the filing of such document, if the Farids Group, its counsel or the managing underwriter, if any, shall reasonably object, in writing, on a timely basis. (b) Prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and post-effective amendments to each Eligible Registration Statement as may be necessary to keep such Eligible Registration Statement continuously effective for the effectiveness period; and comply with the provisions of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to it with respect to the disposition of all securities covered by such Eligible Registration Statement as so amended or in such Prospectus as so supplemented. 20





(c) Notify the Farids Group, its counsel and the managing underwriter, if any, promptly (but in any event within 10 business days), and confirm such notice in writing, (i) when a Prospectus or any prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment has been filed, and, with respect to an Eligible Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment, when the same has become effective (including in such notice a written statement that the Farids Group may, upon request, obtain, without charge, one conformed copy of such Eligible Registration Statement or post-effective amendment including financial statements and schedules, all documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference and all exhibits), (ii) of the issuance by the SEC of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of a Eligible Registration Statement or of any order preventing or suspending the use of any preliminary prospectus or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose, (iii) if at any time when a prospectus is required by the Securities Act to be delivered in connection with sales of the Eligible Registrable Securities the representations and warranties of the Company contained in any agreement (including any underwriting agreement) contemplated by Section 6.6(k) below cease to be true and correct in all material respects, (iv) of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification or exemption from qualification of an Eligible Registration Statement or any of the Registrable Securities for offer or sale in any jurisdiction, or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose, (v) of the happening of any event that makes any statement made in such Eligible Registration Statement or related Prospectus or any document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference untrue in any material respect or that requires the making of any changes in such Eligible Registration Statement, Prospectus or documents so that, in the case of such Eligible Registration Statement, it will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and that in the case of the Prospectus, it will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and (vi) of the Company's reasonable determination that a post-effective amendment to an Eligible Registration Statement would be appropriate. (d) Use its reasonable best efforts to prevent the issuance of any order suspending the effectiveness of an Eligible Registration Statement or of any order preventing or suspending the use of a Prospectus or suspending the qualification (or exemption from qualification) of any of the Registrable Securities for sale in any jurisdiction, and, if any such order is issued, to obtain the withdrawal of any such order at the earliest possible moment.

(f) Furnish to the Farids Group and each managing underwriter, if any, without charge, one conformed copy of the Eligible Registration Statement or Statements and each post-effective amendment thereto, including financial statements and schedules, all documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference and all exhibits. 21





(g) Deliver to the Farids Group, its counsel and the underwriters, if any, without charge, as many copies of the Prospectus or Prospectuses (including each form of prospectus) and each amendment or supplement thereto as such Persons may reasonably request; and, the Company hereby consents to the use of such Prospectus and each amendment or supplement thereto by the Farids Group and the underwriters, if any, in connection with the offering and sale of the Registrable Securities covered by such Prospectus and an amendment or supplement thereto. (h) Prior to any public offering of Registrable Securities, to use its reasonable best efforts to register or qualify, and cooperate with the Farids Group, the underwriters, if any, the sales agent and their respective counsel in connection with the registration or qualification (or exemption from such registration or qualification) of such Registrable Securities for offer and sale under the securities or "blue sky" laws of such jurisdictions within the United States as the Farids Group or the managing underwriter, if any, reasonably request in writing; use its reasonable best efforts to keep each such registration or qualification (or exemption therefrom) effective during the period during which the related Eligible Registration Statement is required to be kept effective and use its reasonable best efforts to do any and all other acts or things necessary or advisable to enable the disposition in such jurisdictions of the Registrable Securities covered by the applicable Eligible Registration Statement; provided, however, that the Company will not be required to (A) qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not then so qualified or (B) take any action that would subject it to general service of process or taxation in any such jurisdiction where it is not then so subject. (i) Upon the occurrence of any event contemplated by clause (v) or (vi) of Section 6.6(c) above, as promptly as practicable prepare a supplement or post-effective amendment to the Eligible Registration Statement or a supplement to the related Prospectus or any document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference, or file any other required document so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of the Registrable Securities being sold thereunder, such Prospectus will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. (j) Enter into an underwriting agreement in form, scope and substance as is customary in underwritten offerings and take all such other actions as are reasonably requested by the managing underwriter in order to expedite or facilitate the registration or the disposition of such Registrable Securities, and in such connection, (i) make such customary representations and warranties to the underwriters, with respect to the business of the Company and its subsidiaries, and the Eligible Registration Statement, Prospectus and documents, if any, incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference therein; (ii) obtain opinions of counsel to the Company and updates thereof (which counsel and opinions shall be reasonably satisfactory (in form, scope and substance) to the managing underwriter), addressed to the underwriters covering the matters customarily covered in opinions requested in underwritten offerings and such other matters as may be reasonably requested by the underwriters; and (iii) obtain "comfort" letters and updates thereof from the independent certified public accountants of the Company (and, if necessary, any other independent certified public accountants of any subsidiary of the Company or of any business acquired by the Company for which financial statements and financial data are, or are required to be, included in the Eligible Registration Statement), addressed to each of the underwriters, such letters to be in customary form and covering matters of the type customarily covered in "comfort" letters in connection with underwritten offerings. The above shall be done at each closing under such underwriting agreement, or as and to the extent required thereunder. 22

Section 6.8 Indemnification. In the event any Registrable Securities are included in an Eligible Registration Statement under Section 6.1 or 6.2: (a) To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Company will indemnify and hold harmless the Farids Group, the partners, members, directors and officers of any member of the Farids Group, any underwriter (as defined in the Securities Act), the directors and officers of such underwriter, and each person, if any, who controls any member of the Farids Group or such underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act (collectively, the "Non-Company Indemnified Parties"), against any losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (joint or several) to which they may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or other federal or state law, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or suits, actions or proceedings in respect thereof) and reasonable documented expenses that arise out of or are based upon any of the following statements, omissions or violations by the Company: (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in such Eligible Registration Statement or incorporated by reference therein, including any preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or summary prospectus contained therein or any amendments or supplements thereto or any document incorporated by reference therein, or any other such disclosure document (including reports and other documents filed under the Exchange Act and any document incorporated by reference therein) or related document or report, (ii) any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein (in the case of an Eligible Registration Statement only), or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in the case of a prospectus, in the light of the circumstances when they were made, or (iii) any violation or alleged violation by the Company or any of its subsidiaries of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, any state securities law or any rule or regulation promulgated under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or any federal, state, foreign or common law, rule or regulation in connection with the offering covered by such Eligible Registration Statement (collectively, a "Violation"); and the Company will reimburse each such Non-Company Indemnified Party for any reasonable legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability, suit, action or proceeding; provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 6.8(a) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability, suit, action or proceeding if such settlement is effected without the consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, nor shall the Company be liable in any such case for any such loss, claim, damage, liability, suit, action or proceeding to the extent that it arises out of or is based upon a Violation which occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished expressly for use in connection with such Eligible Registration Statement by such Non-Company Indemnified Party. 23





(b) To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Farids Group will, jointly and severally, indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, any underwriter (as defined in the Securities Act), the directors and officers of such underwriter, and each person, if any, who controls such underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (joint or several) to which the Company or any such director, officer, employee, agent, representative, controlling person or underwriter may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or other federal or state law, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or suits, actions or proceedings in respect thereof) and reasonable documented expenses that arise out of or are based upon any of the following statements, omissions or violations: (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in such Eligible Registration Statement or incorporated by reference therein, including any preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or summary prospectus contained therein or any amendments or supplements thereto or any document incorporated by reference therein, or any other such disclosure document (including reports and other documents filed under the Exchange Act and any document incorporated by reference therein) or related document or report, (ii) any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein (in the case of an Eligible Registration Statement only), or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in the case of a prospectus, in the light of the circumstances when they were made, or (iii) any violation or alleged violation by the Company or any of its subsidiaries of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, any state securities law or any rule or regulation promulgated under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or any federal, state, foreign or common law, rule or regulation in connection with the offering covered by such Eligible Registration Statement (collectively, a "Holder Violation"), in each case to the extent (and only to the extent) that such Holder Violation occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished by the Farids Group expressly for use in connection with such Eligible Registration Statement; and the Farids Group will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company or any such director, officer, employee, agent, representative, controlling person or underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability, suit, action or proceeding if it is judicially determined that there was such a Holder Violation; provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 6.8(b) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability, suit, action or proceeding if such settlement is effected without the consent of the Farids Group, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned; provided, further, that in no event shall any indemnity under this Section 6.8(b) exceed the net proceeds from the offering received by the Farids Group upon the sale of the Registrable Securities giving rise to such indemnification obligation. 24





(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 6.8 (an "Indemnified Party") of written notice of the commencement of any claim, damage, suit, action or proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation) being brought or asserted against it, such Indemnified Party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against any indemnifying party under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 6.8 (an "Indemnifying Party"), deliver to the Indemnifying Party a written notice of the commencement thereof; provided, that the failure of the Indemnified Party to deliver written notice to the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve it from any liability it may have under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 6.8 except to the extent such failure has materially prejudiced the Indemnifying Party's ability to defend such action (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses). The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate in, and, to the extent the Indemnifying Party so desires, jointly with any other Indemnifying Party who has received a similar notice, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party to represent the Indemnified Party in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of such counsel relating to such proceeding, and after notice from the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the Indemnifying Party shall not, except as specified below, be liable to such Indemnified Party under paragraph (a) or (b) above, as the case may be, for any legal expenses of other counsel. In any such proceeding, an Indemnified Party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, with the fees and expenses to be paid by the Indemnified Party; provided the Indemnifying Party will pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel if (i) the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall have so mutually agreed; (ii) the Indemnifying Party has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party; (iii) the Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded, based on the advice of counsel, that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Party; or (iv) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interest between them. It is understood and agreed that the Indemnifying Party shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel that is required to effectively defend against any such proceeding) for all Indemnified Parties, and that all such fees and expenses shall be paid or reimbursed promptly. The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Party agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No Indemnifying Party shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Party is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Party, unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Party. 25





(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 6.8 is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to an Indemnified Party with respect to any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to herein, the Indemnifying Party, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party thereunder, shall to the extent permitted by applicable Law contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as a result of such loss, claim, damage or liability in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Indemnifying Party on the one hand and of the Indemnified Party on the other in connection with the actions that resulted in such loss, claim, damage or liability, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the Indemnifying Party and of the Indemnified Party shall be determined by a court of law by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Indemnifying Party or by the Indemnified Party and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission; provided, that in no event shall any contribution by a Holder hereunder exceed the net proceeds from the offering made under such Eligible Registration Statement received by such Holder. (e) The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to Section 6.8(d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. (f) The obligations of the Company and the Farids Group under this Section 6.8 shall survive completion of any offering of Registrable Securities in an Eligible Registration Statement and the termination of this Agreement. (g) The obligations of the parties under this Section 6.8 will be in addition to any liability, without duplication, which any party may otherwise have to any other party. Section 6.9 "Market Stand-Off" Agreement. The Farids Group hereby agrees that the Farids Group shall not Transfer, make any short sale of, grant any option for the purchase of, or enter into any hedging or similar transaction with the same economic effect as a sale or other Transfer, any Lock-Up Security held by the Farids Group (other than those included in the registration) for a period specified by the representative(s) of the underwriters of Registrable Securities or any other securities sold in any offering in respect of which the Farids Group received notice from the Company in accordance with Section 6.2, such period not to exceed one hundred and eighty (180) days following the pricing date of any underwritten offering; provided that the Farids Group shall only be required to comply with this Section 6.9 if the Farids Group beneficially own (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act, or any successor provision) at least 3.0% or more of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at such time. The Company may impose stop transfer instructions with respect to any Lock-Up Security subject to the foregoing restriction until the end of said one hundred and eighty (180) day or shorter period. 26

The underwriters of Registrable Securities are intended third party beneficiaries of Sections 6.8 and 6.10 and shall have the right, power and authority to enforce the provisions hereof as though they were a party hereto. Section 6.11 Termination. The rights and obligations of the Farids Group set forth in this Article VI (other than those set forth in Sections 6.8 and 6.9) shall terminate on the date that the Farids Group owns less than 3% of the issued and outstanding Common Stock, but in no event earlier than the Expiration Date (as defined in the Warrant).
