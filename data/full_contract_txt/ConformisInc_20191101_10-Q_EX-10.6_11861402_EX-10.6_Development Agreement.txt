ARTICLE II   RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM   2.1 R&D Work Plan. The Parties agree to conduct the R&D Program pursuant to the R&D Work Plan and to perform   their respective obligations therein. To the extent Conformis' performance under the R&D Program is delayed due to Stryker's   delay in performing any of its obligations in accordance with the timelines in the R&D Work Plan, the applicable timelines shall be   deemed extended by a period of time corresponding to the length of such portion of the delay attributable to Stryker, on a day-by-   day basis.

To the extent working with Agents or other Third Parties is permitted under the R&D Work   Plan, should a Party wish to engage an Agent or any other Third Party in connection with the R&D Work Plan or any other work   under this Agreement, such Party must obtain in advance a written agreement by such Agent or other Third Party (i) to assign to   the Party all Inventions conceived, created or generated by the Agent or other Third Party, and (ii) to maintain all Confidential   Information in confidence as set forth in Section 5.2.

is intended to be exploited under the Other Agreements, (2) misappropriate any Confidential Information of any Third Party, or   (3) otherwise violate any Intellectual Property rights of any Third Party. For clarity, disclosure of a matter on the Disclosure   Schedules to the Asset Purchase Agreement shall not be deemed consent by Stryker under this Section 3.2.   3.3 Completion. After a Deliverable has been furnished to Stryker, Stryker (or its Agent designee) will be entitled to   analyze and test the Deliverable to determine if it operates in accordance with and otherwise conforms to the applicable   Acceptance Criteria set forth in R&D Work Plan. Conformis shall provide such assistance as Stryker may reasonably request in   such determination. Stryker shall have [**] ("Acceptance Notification Period") following the date the Deliverable is received by   Stryker to Accept or reject the Deliverable as described in Section 3.4.   3.4 Acceptance or Rejection. Respecting any Deliverable for Milestone #1 or Milestone #2, as set forth below, if   Stryker determines that a Deliverable operates in accordance with and otherwise conforms to the applicable Acceptance Criteria   pursuant to the R&D Work Plan, then Stryker will notify Conformis in writing that Stryker Accepts such Deliverable. If Stryker   reasonably determines that a Deliverable does not operate in accordance with or otherwise conform to the applicable Acceptance   Criteria, then Stryker will provide Conformis with a written notice of rejection within the Acceptance Notification Period   describing the defect in view of the relevant Acceptance Criteria and including sufficient detail with respect to such Stryker testing   and testing results as Conformis reasonably requests ("Failure Notice"). Conformis shall have [**] (or such longer period of time   as may be agreed between the parties in good faith should the scope and complexity of the applicable Deliverable warrant some   longer period of time) ("Redelivery Period") following the date it receives the Failure Notice to correct and redeliver the   Deliverable. If Conformis timely delivers a corrected version of the Deliverable within the Redelivery Period, then Stryker will be   9   Source: CONFORMIS INC, 10-Q, 11/1/2019



entitled to repeat its acceptance analysis and testing process for the purposes of determining Acceptance as set forth in the R&D   Work Plan until such Deliverable operates in accordance with or otherwise conforms to the applicable Acceptance Criteria;   provided, however, that if Stryker properly rejects a particular Deliverable three (3) or more times in accordance with this Article   III, or if Conformis fails to deliver a version or corrected version, as the case may be, of the Deliverable within any respective [**]   period, Stryker may, terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.2(c) (in the event of such three (3) rejections, Stryker   "Finally Rejects" the Deliverable). Such termination, together with the provisions of Section 5.2 of the License Agreement,   constitutes as Stryker's sole remedy and Conformis' exclusive liability in the event of any such rejection or failure by Conformis to   deliver materially conforming Deliverables hereunder so long as such rejection or failure does not arise from Conformis' fraud,   willful misconduct, gross negligence or bad faith. Stryker shall be deemed to have accepted a Deliverable timely furnished to it   unless (a) the Deliverable fails to operate in accordance with and otherwise conform the applicable Acceptance Criteria, and (b)   Stryker provides Conformis a written Failure Notice within the Acceptance Notification Period in accordance with this Section   3.4 (any acceptance or deemed acceptance, described in this Section 3.4, "Acceptance" or "Accept"). Acceptance of a   Deliverable shall not constitute a waiver of any rights Stryker may have based on Conformis' warranties set forth in this   Agreement.   3.5 Payment for Milestones. Stryker shall pay to Conformis the following milestone payments for the development   work to be conducted hereunder if and when the following milestones are met, as follows:   (a) Milestone #1 - Within thirty (30) days following the date on which Stryker receives the first prototype of the Patient-   Specific Instrumentation delivered to it by Conformis in accordance with the R&D Work Plan, Stryker shall pay to Conformis a   total of two million U.S. dollars ($2,000,000); and   10   Source: CONFORMIS INC, 10-Q, 11/1/2019



(b) Milestone #2 - Within thirty (30) days following the date on which there is a design freeze of the Patient-Specific   Instrumentation for the KIB Product in accordance with the R&D Work Plan, Stryker shall pay to Conformis a total of three   million U.S dollars ($3,000,000).   3.6 Payment. Stryker shall make all payments to Conformis required herein by wire transfer in accordance with the Wire   Instructions. Such payments are non-refundable and non-creditable except as set forth in the Other Agreements.   ARTICLE IV   RESTRICTIVE COVENANT   4.1 Exclusivity. Except as specifically provided in the Distribution Agreement, Conformis shall be prohibited from   developing or assisting another in developing, or causing another to develop, Patient-Specific Instrumentation for Off-The-Shelf   Knee Implants for any Third Party in the field of orthopedics until January 1, 2032 (or earlier, to the extent set forth in Section   2.3.3.4 or Section 2.3.5 of the Distribution Agreement), with the exception that Conformis (including any entity involved in a   Change of Control of Conformis, any such entity an "Acquirer"), may develop Patient-Specific Instrumentation for any Off-The-   Shelf Implants of Conformis, an Acquirer or any of their Affiliates. For purposes of clarity, the foregoing does not prevent   Conformis from granting any license, release, covenant not to sue or other immunity to any third party under any Patents, including   any such immunity that would authorize manufacture, use or sale of Patient-Specific Instrumentation for Off-The-Shelf Knee   Implants outside the Buyer Field.

(c) All right, title and interest in and to the Improved Conformis Background IP and KIB Product IP ("Joint IP") shall be   owned jointly by the Parties.

Each Party to whom ownership is to vest in Joint IP by operation of law or by assignment by its employees or Agents agrees   to assign and hereby assigns to the other Party an undivided one-half right, title and interest in and to all Joint IP; and to facilitate   such assignment, the Party possessing such ownership agrees (i) to regularly ensure that its employees and consultants timely make   any appropriate assignments to it; and (ii) at the other Party's reasonable request, to execute and have its employees and   consultants execute, as necessary, all assignments and any other documentation to perfect the undivided one-half right, title and   interest in and to the other Party of such Joint IP.   (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the foregoing does not constitute either (1) the grant by Conformis to Stryker   of any license or immunity of any kind with respect to the Conformis Background IP or Conformis Foreground IP, regardless of   the extent to which the Joint IP constitutes improvements to the Conformis Background IP or Conformis Foreground IP, (2) the   grant by Stryker to Conformis of any license or immunity of any kind with respect to the Stryker Background IP, or (3) the grant   by either Party of any license or immunity of any kind under any Intellectual Property rights owned by such Party, regardless of   whether the exploitation of the Joint IP would infringe such Intellectual Property rights. Neither Party shall assign a partial interest in   12   Source: CONFORMIS INC, 10-Q, 11/1/2019



the Joint IP or Joint IP Rights to any Affiliate or Third Party (i.e., neither Party shall create any additional joint owners of the Joint   IP), but each Party may assign all of its right, title and interest in and to the Joint IP and Joint IP Rights to an Affiliate or Third Party   pursuant to and in accordance with Section 10.2.   (e) Conformis shall promptly disclose to Stryker all (i) Improved Stryker Background IP, and (ii) Joint IP. Stryker shall   promptly disclose to Conformis all Joint IP.
