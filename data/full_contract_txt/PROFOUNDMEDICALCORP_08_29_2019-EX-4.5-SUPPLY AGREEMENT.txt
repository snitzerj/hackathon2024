12.6 Termination of this Agreement in accordance with this clause 12, is without prejudice to any right to claim for amounts or interest accrued prior to the date of such termination under this Agreement. 12.7 All terms and conditions of this Agreement which are intended (whether expressed or not) to survive the duration or termination of this Agreement will so survive, including, for greater certainty, clauses 2.3, 2.4, 6, 10, 12, 13, 14, and 18. 12.8 Within [Redacted - Commercially Sensitive - Time Period] of the Effective Date, the parties shall negotiate, acting reasonably and in good faith, a transition plan (the "Transition Plan") to provide for a smooth transfer and transition of the manufacturing activities under this Agreement to Customer, an Affiliate of Customer or a third party manufacturer designated by Customer. The Transition Plan shall be negotiated based on the key transition terms outlined in Schedule 5 hereto (the "Transition Plan Term Sheet"). In connection with the negotiation and ultimately implementation of the Transition Plan, Parties shall install a project team which: (a) shall have a manager ("Project Manager"), one from Philips, who has experience in transferring manufacturing actives, and one from Customer, who has experience in setting up manufacturing activities; (b) shall be committed with sufficient capacity - made available by both Parties - to execute the Transition Plan within the given time frame (quantity), and the Parties shall ensure that sufficient and reasonable organizational resources are provided to each such Project Manager to ensure a smooth, uninterrupted and efficient transition of the manufacturing of the Product; (c) shall be sufficiently skilled and experienced with the activities under this Agreement (quality); (d) shall be fully dedicated to the timely and adequate execution of the Transition Plan. 12.9 The Parties shall perform such activities as set forth in the Transition Plan and shall otherwise perform all such obligations in good faith to ensure a smooth transfer of the manufacturing activities under this Agreement to Customer. In connection with the Transition Plan, Customer will pay all reasonable freight cost and any Philips' employee (or third parties engaged by Philips) at [Redacted - Commercial Sensitive - Billing Rate], as needed, in connection with the implementation of the Transition Plan. For greater certainty, Philips will only engage third party support to assist with the transition if such additional support is required in order to implement the Transition Plan and such additional support is previously approved by Customer in writing (not to be unreasonably withheld). If to the opinion of the Project Team, circumstances occur in which the timely and/or proper execution of the Transition Plan is obstructed, this shall be immediately reported to the relevant executive officers of both Parties for immediate resolution.

If the Delivery of Products, services and/or documentation is subject to the granting of an export or import license by certain governmental authorities or otherwise restricted or prohibited due to export/import control regulations, Philips may suspend its obligations and Customer's and/or end-user's rights until such license is granted or for the duration of such restrictions or prohibitions.

Philips shall give Customer prompt written notice of any upcoming inspections or audits by a Governmental Authority, governmental entity or any third party entity authorized by a Governmental Authority of the Philips facility or any of the foregoing, shall provide Customer with a written summary of such inspection or audit within five (5) Business Days following completion thereof. Philips agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly rectify or resolve any deficiencies (consisting of any failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements under applicable Law then in force) noted by a Governmental Authority, governmental entity or any third party entity authorized by a Governmental Authority in a report or correspondence issued to Philips or Customer. Subject to any specific arrangements agreed upon by the parties and subject to any limitations due to the fact (and until) Philips is the legal manufacturer, Customer shall be responsible for communicating with any Governmental Authority concerning the Product or the marketing, distribution, sale use of the Product, and Philips shall provide Customer with such assistance as Customer may reasonably require to assist it in such communications. Philips shall have no such communications specifically related to the Product, except to the extent (and notwithstanding its confidentiality undertakings in this Agreement) that they relate to Philips's manufacture, testing, storage and preparation for shipment of Product under this Agreement or as required of Philips directly by the Governmental Authority (including but not limited to due to the fact (and until) Philips is the legal manufacturer of the Product), in which case Philips shall be responsible for such communications. Notwithstanding the foregoing and except to the extent that an immediate or urgent communication is necessary under the circumstances or required by applicable Law, Philips in good faith shall consult in advance with Customer regarding all communications with any Governmental Authority that relate to Product or to Philips' ability to manufacture the Product pursuant to this Agreement.
