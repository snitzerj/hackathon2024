Vendor shall timely, diligently and continuously pursue and use reasonable best efforts to obtain as soon as possible any Permits required to be obtained in connection with or in order to perform the Work and otherwise fulfill its obligations under this Agreement, the Build Addendum and/or the Maintenance Addendum, including without limitation requesting assistance from AT&T as appropriate. Upon Vendor's reasonable request for AT&T's assistance in obtaining any such Permit, the Parties agree to cooperate in good faith to obtain such Permit. To the extent that Vendor (x) has timely notified AT&T of related Delay Information contemplated in Subsection (a) above, (y) has complied with this Section 3.3(b) and (z) is nevertheless unable to obtain or delayed in obtaining a required Permit which is reasonably likely to result in Vendor missing a Delivery Date or Completion Date (a "Permitting Delay"), then the Parties shall cooperate in good faith to extend such Delivery Date or Completion Date and such Permitting Delay shall constitute an Excusable Delay; provided, however that if the Parties cannot agree on a new Delivery Date or Completion Date or in the event of a Permitting Delay preventing or delaying Vendor's performance which AT&T determines is reasonably likely to cause a material delay of the ultimate Delivery Date or Completion Date applicable to a Cell Site, AT&T may elect to, after consultation with Vendor and good faith discussion to negotiate another resolution:

(i) terminate its obligations solely with respect to each Cell Site affected by or related to such Permitting Delay under this Agreement and exercise any of the Termination Remedies set forth in the Build Addendum, without liability to Vendor; provided that AT&T shall pay to Vendor, an amount equal to the demonstrated costs incurred by Vendor for any Work completed (in accordance with applicable Specifications and requirements) to the extent such Work is transferred to AT&T as of the effective time of termination of the applicable terminated Cell Site, which amount shall not exceed $[***]; or

(ii) suspend this Agreement or any part hereof for the duration of such Permitting Delay (as such period is reasonably determined by AT&T) solely with respect to any Cell Site affected by or related to such Permitting Delay, obtain Work elsewhere (including AT&T's performance of the Work itself), at AT&T's cost and expense (which shall reduce the Structured Payments applicable to such Cell Site by such amount, but in no event shall such reduction cause the Structured Payments to be less than an amount equal to the demonstrated costs incurred by Vendor up to the date of suspension), and provide notice to Vendor when AT&T desires for Vendor to resume its performance under this Agreement for the remaining Work at such Cell Site.

(c) Actual Delays. Except in the case of an Excusable Delay and subject to any applicable cure period, in the event of any actual delay reasonably attributable to Vendor that causes Vendor to miss a Delivery Date or Completion Date, Vendor will provide written notice to AT&T and if the condition remains uncured after the expiration of any applicable cure period set forth in this Agreement, the Build Addendum and/or the Maintenance Addendum, AT&T may exercise any remedies available to AT&T under this Agreement, the Build Addendum and/or the Maintenance Addendum, as applicable.

3.4 Anticorruption Laws. Vendor hereby represents and warrants that the employees, agents, consultants, partners, officers, directors, members or representatives of Vendor and its

Subcontractors, if any, performing Services or other activities under this Agreement (each and any of the foregoing individuals, for the purpose of this Section, a "Vendor Representative") shall comply with the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and all applicable anticorruption laws (including commercial bribery laws). Vendor Representatives shall not directly or indirectly pay, offer, give, promise to pay or authorize the payment of any portion of the compensation received in connection with this Agreement or any other monies or other things of value in connection with its performance to a Government Official, as such term is defined below, to obtain or retain business or secure any improper advantage nor shall it permit such actions by a third party in connection with this Agreement. For purposes of this Section, "Government Official" means: (i) an officer or employee of any government or any department, agency, or instrumentality thereof, including government-owned or government-controlled commercial entities; (ii) an officer or employee of a public international organization; (iii) any person acting in an official capacity for or on behalf of any government or department, agency, or instrumentality or public international organization; (iv) any political party or official thereof; (v) any candidate for political office; or (vi) any other Person at the suggestion, request or direction or for the benefit of any of the above-described Persons.

3.5 Assignment and Delegation; Change of Control.

(a) Neither Party may assign, delegate, or otherwise transfer any of its duties or obligations under this Agreement, voluntarily or involuntarily, without the prior written consent of the other Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed and which shall be signed by an authorized representative of the Party giving such consent); provided, however, that without the consent of Vendor, AT&T may assign its rights, or delegate its duties, or both, in whole or in part, to any present or future Affiliate of AT&T so long as AT&T Mobility LLC shall remain liable for such Affiliate's failure to satisfy its obligations hereunder.

(b) Each Party may assign its rights under the Agreement, but any assignment of rights will be void to the extent that (i) the assignment purports to impose upon the non-assigning Party additional costs or obligations or requires AT&T to make payments to any Person other than Vendor, (ii) the assignment purports to preclude AT&T from dealing solely and directly with Vendor in all matters pertaining to this Agreement, including with respect to payments of Structured Payments and Maintenance Fees or (iii) the assignee is a Restricted Entity.

(c) Subject to Section 3.5(b), in the event that Vendor, prior to Location Acceptance at all Cell Sites and without the prior written consent of AT&T, consummates (i) any sale, assignment, transfer, license, lease or conveyance of any interest in any Cell Site or any of the Material or Services contemplated in this Agreement or (ii) any Change of Control of Vendor to a Restricted Entity or to any other Person who, in AT&T's reasonable discretion, lacks the financial or operational resources, skill or expertise to fulfill the obligations of Vendor contemplated by this Agreement, then AT&T may terminate this Agreement and exercise any other remedies available to AT&T under this Agreement or at law or equity, including any of its Termination Remedies set forth in the Build Addendum. If, following Location Acceptance of all Cell Sites, Vendor consummates any Change of Control of Vendor to any Restricted Entity without the prior written consent of AT&T, then AT&T shall have the right, in its sole

discretion, to (x) immediately terminate the Maintenance Addendum without further liability or obligation (other than payment of Maintenance Fees for Maintenance Services performed prior to the date of such termination), but not this Agreement or the obligation to make the Structured Payments herein; and/or (y) prepay all of the remaining Structured Payments at any time in one lump sum payment without penalty, liability or obligations (including any "make- whole" obligation or Close-Out Costs (as such term is defined in the Build Addendum)).

(d) Any assignment, delegation or transfer for which consent is required hereby and which is made without such consent given in writing will be void. No assignment by a Party will relieve such Party of its obligations under this Agreement.

3.6 Compliance with Laws. Vendor shall comply with all Laws applicable to Vendor's performance under this Agreement, including all Work contemplated herein and all Material, Services and Deliverables provided hereunder, and AT&T's utilization of the Cell Sites. Vendor shall procure all approvals, bonds, certificates, insurance, inspections, licenses, and permits that such Laws require for the performance of this Agreement. Vendor shall create and maintain any necessary records and provide any certificate, affidavit or other information or documentation requested or as otherwise required by AT&T: (a) to show compliance by Vendor and its Subcontractors with Laws, (b) to comply or otherwise establish AT&T's compliance with Laws or (c) to allow AT&T to timely respond to any complaints, filings, or other proceedings.

3.7 Conflict of Interest. Vendor represents and warrants that, to its knowledge, no officer, director, employee or agent of AT&T has been or will be employed, retained or paid a fee, or otherwise has received or will receive, any personal compensation or consideration, by or from Vendor or any of Vendor's officers, directors, employees or agents in connection with the obtaining, arranging or negotiation of this Agreement or other documents entered into or executed in connection with this Agreement.

Vendor shall not offer or give gratuities in the form of gifts, entertainment, concessions, or otherwise to AT&T or its employees or representative(s), or any person related by blood or marriage to such individuals for the express or implied purpose of obtaining or securing favorable treatment with respect to this Agreement, or in the inspection or acceptance of the Services to be performed thereunder. Vendor shall not engage in any conduct which will constitute or appear to constitute a conflict of interest between Vendor's responsibility to AT&T under this contract and Vendor's responsibility to any person, business, or other entity with which Vendor may have had any dealings.

3.8 Construction and Interpretation

(a) This Agreement has been prepared jointly and has been the subject of arm's length and careful negotiation. Each Party has been given the opportunity to independently review this Agreement with legal counsel and other consultants, and each Party has the requisite experience and sophistication to understand, interpret and agree to the particular language of its provisions. Accordingly, the drafting of this Agreement is not to be attributed to either Party.

Proprietary and Confidential This Agreement and information contained therein is not for use or disclosure outside of AT&T, its Affiliates, and third party representatives, and Vendor except under written agreement by the contracting parties. 11

(b) Article, Section and paragraph headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and are not to affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. The word "include" in every form means to include without limitation by virtue of enumeration and a derivative of a defined term shall have the meaning appropriate to the context of its use. Whenever this Agreement refers to a consent or approval to be given by either Party, unless such consent is expressly required to be given in writing and signed by the Party giving approval or consent, then such consent or approval is effective if given in an email from the individuals identified in Section 3.26 or designated by Vendor as its Project Manager pursuant to Section 18 of the Build Addendum. The Parties agree that time is of the essence with respect to AT&T's approval rights pursuant to this Agreement and the Build Addendum and Maintenance Addendum and Vendor is relying on the timeliness of such approvals or consents as set forth herein in order to complete the Services. The use of singular words includes the plural and vice versa.

3.9 Cumulative Remedies. The rights and remedies of the Parties set forth in this Agreement are not exclusive of, but are cumulative to, any rights or remedies now or subsequently existing at law, in equity, by statute or otherwise, except in those cases where this Agreement specifies that a particular remedy is sole or exclusive, but neither Party may retain the benefit of inconsistent remedies. No single or partial exercise of any right or remedy with respect to one breach of this Agreement precludes the simultaneous or subsequent exercise of any other right or remedy with respect to the same or a different breach.

3.10 Delivery, Performance and Acceptance

(a) Vendor acknowledges that AT&T is responsible for the deployment of the FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network (the "NPSBN") in accordance with the terms of AT&T's agreement with the FirstNet Authority and that AT&T has provided certain terms of such agreement to Vendor but has not provided Vendor with a copy of such agreement with the FirstNet Authority. Therefore, Vendor understands generally that AT&T's business requires prompt Delivery of Material and provision of Services by the specified Delivery Dates. Furthermore, the Parties agree that dates for Delivery of Material and Services are firm subject to any Excusable Delay, time is of the essence, and, subject to any Excusable Delay, Vendor will complete such Delivery in strict conformance with the Specifications.

(b) Vendor shall perform or cause to be performed testing sufficient to ensure that all of the Material and Deliverables perform in accordance with the Specifications, including all of the Cell Site optimization and testing contemplated by the Build Addendum. If testing indicates that any of the Cell Sites (or any of the Material or Deliverables relating thereto) does not conform to the Specifications, then Vendor shall notify AT&T, in writing, of such non- conformance promptly following Vendor's knowledge of such non- conformance. AT&T will advise Vendor whether Vendor should Deliver the non-conforming Cell Site or any of the Deliverables or Material relating thereto. In the event AT&T and Vendor agree in a signed writing to Deliver non-conforming Cell Sites or any of the Deliverables or Material relating thereto ("Provisional Location Acceptance"), Vendor shall use all commercially reasonable efforts promptly to cure any such non- conformance after Provisional Location Acceptance of

the non-conforming Cell Site; provided, however, that if Vendor has not cured all such non- conformance with respect to the Cell Site within nine (9) months following Provisional Location Acceptance (or sixty (60) days if the non-conformance is caused by the existence of a Lien, and in each case subject to an Excusable Delay), then AT&T may elect in its sole discretion, to complete any outstanding work, and recoup any costs by an offset against the Maintenance Fees due to Vendor for all Cell Sites. If such non-conforming Cell Site has not been cured within such nine (9) month cure period (or 60-day cure period in the case of a Lien), AT&T shall have no further obligation to pay any Maintenance Fees to Vendor with respect to such non-conforming Cell Site until the non-conformance has been cured. Provisional Location Acceptance of any such non-conforming Cell Site or receipt of any of the Deliverables or Material relating thereto shall not constitute Location Acceptance and shall not constitute a waiver of any of AT&T's rights, warranties, or remedies under this Agreement or elsewhere, including Termination Remedies under the Build Addendum. Location Acceptance of any such non-conforming Cell Site shall not occur until all non-conformance has been cured; provided, that AT&T shall begin making Structured Payments for such Cell Site upon Provisional Location Acceptance in the same manner as if it were Location Acceptance.

(c) In no event shall Location Acceptance be deemed to occur absent a signed writing from AT&T prior to the date Vendor completes its Delivery of all Material and Services in accordance with the Specifications related to the Cell Site as required by the Build Addendum.

(d) If AT&T advises Vendor of, or Vendor becomes aware of a landlord complaint, Vendor shall, if necessary, promptly respond to the landlord complaint, shall commence any agreed upon corrections promptly, and shall diligently pursue the same until completion.

(e) In addition to the provisions set forth in this Section, AT&T shall be able to exercise any or all remedies available to it under the Build Addendum and Maintenance Addendum.

3.11 Entire Agreement. Except to the extent otherwise expressly referenced herein, including the matters set forth in the Transport Agreement and the Master License Agreement, this Agreement and all addendums, appendices, exhibits, attachments, schedules and documents incorporated herein by reference, constitutes the final, complete, and exclusive expression of the Parties' agreement on the matters contained in this Agreement. The terms of this Agreement shall govern in lieu of all other pre-printed, standardized or other provisions that may otherwise appear in any other paper or electronic record of either Party (such as standard terms on order or acknowledgment forms, advance shipping notices, invoices, time sheets, and packages, shrink wrap terms, and click wrap terms). Except to the extent set forth in the Transport Agreement and the Master License Agreement, all prior written and oral negotiations and agreements, and all contemporaneous oral negotiations and agreements, between the Parties on the matters contained in this Agreement are expressly merged into and superseded by this Agreement. The Parties do not intend that the provisions of this Agreement be explained, supplemented, or qualified through evidence of trade usage or any prior course of dealings or any course of performance under any prior agreement. In entering into this Agreement, neither Party has relied upon any statement, estimate, forecast, projection, representation, warranty, action or agreement of the other Party except for those expressly contained in this Agreement. There are no

conditions precedent to the effectiveness of this Agreement other than any such condition expressly stated in this Agreement.

3.12 Force Majeure

(a) Except for AT&T's obligations to make the Structured Payments and pay the Maintenance Fees, a Party is excused from performing its obligations under this Agreement only if, to the extent that, and for so long as such Party's performance is actually prevented or delayed by acts of God or the public enemy, acts of civil or military authority, terrorists acts, embargoes, epidemics, war, riots, insurrections, fires, explosions, earthquakes, floods, and weather events that are beyond its reasonable control and could not have been prevented or avoided by its exercise of due diligence and such Party gives written notice to the other Party, as soon as practicable under the circumstances, of the act or event that so prevents such Party from performing its obligations (each, a "Force Majeure Event"). After Vendor provides written notice to AT&T of any Force Majeure Event in accordance with the preceding sentence, the Parties shall extend the applicable Delivery Date or Completion Date for the length of such Force Majeure Event and, subject to Subsection (b) below, such Force Majeure Event shall be an Excusable Delay.

(b) If Vendor is the Party whose performance is prevented or delayed by a Force Majeure Event and AT&T determines that the Force Majeure Event is reasonably likely to cause a material delay of the ultimate Delivery Date or Completion Date for any Cell Site, then AT&T may elect to, after consultation with Vendor and good faith discussion to negotiate another resolution:

(i) terminate its obligations with respect to each Cell Site affected by or related to such Force Majeure Event under this Agreement and exercise any of the Termination Remedies set forth in the Build Addendum, in each case without liability to Vendor; provided that AT&T shall pay to Vendor, an amount equal to demonstrated costs incurred by Vendor for any Work completed (in accordance with applicable Specifications and requirements) to the extent such Work is transferable to and usable by AT&T as of the effective time of termination of the applicable terminated Cell Site, which amount shall not exceed $[***]; or

(ii) suspend this Agreement or any part hereof for the duration of such Force Majeure Event solely with respect to any Cell Site affected by or related to such Force Majeure Event, obtain Work elsewhere (including AT&T's performance of the Work itself), at AT&T's cost and expense (which shall reduce the Structured Payments applicable to such Cell Site by such amount, but in no event shall such reduction cause the Structured Payments to be less than an amount equal to the demonstrated costs incurred by Vendor up to the date of suspension), and provide notice to Vendor when AT&T desires for Vendor to resume its performance under this Agreement for the remaining Work at such Cell Site.

3.13 Government Contract Provisions and Flow Downs

(a) To the extent that Vendor's performance is required to comply with certain executive orders (including E.O. 11246 and E.O. 13201) and statutes (including Section 503 of the

(c) Vendor agrees to comply with all Government Flow Downs and Contract Clauses to the extent applicable to Vendor's performance as specifically required by that certain contract awarded to an Affiliate of AT&T by the FirstNet Authority regarding the FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network (the "FirstNet Agreement") and such Government Flow Downs and Contract Clauses that may be applicable are attached to this Agreement as Exhibit A, the terms of which are hereby fully incorporated into the Agreement.

3.14 Governing Law. The laws of the State of New York (excluding any laws that direct the application of another jurisdiction's law) govern all matters arising out of or relating to this Agreement and all of the transactions it contemplates, including its validity, interpretation, construction, performance, and enforcement.

3.15 Indemnity

(a) Except for Covered Losses that are exclusively provided for in the Section entitled "Infringement," Vendor shall indemnify, hold harmless, and defend the AT&T Indemnified Parties, in accordance with this Section, against any Third Party Loss arising from, or in connection with, or resulting from, (i) any default, violation, breach or nonperformance by Vendor or any Vendor Person of Vendor's representations, warranties, covenants and obligations under this Agreement, the Build Addendum or the Maintenance Addendum, (ii) the Deliverables, Material or Services furnished by Vendor or any Vendor Person and the use, construction, maintenance, operation or occupancy of any Cell Site by Vendor or any Vendor Person, (iii) the negligent or willful acts or omissions of Vendor and each Vendor Person with respect to this Agreement or (iv) Employment Claims. Subject to AT&T's obligation to reimburse or indemnify Vendor as set forth in Subsection (c) or (d) below, respectively, Vendor's duty to indemnify, hold harmless, and defend the AT&T Indemnified Parties against any Third Party Loss extends to any Third Party Loss that may be caused or alleged to be caused in part by the negligence of any of the AT&T Indemnified Parties to the fullest extent that such indemnification is permitted by applicable Law.

(b) AT&T shall promptly notify Vendor in writing of any claim, demand, suit, cause of action or legal proceeding that may give rise to a claim against Vendor for defense and indemnification under this Section 3.15. If AT&T fails to give notice, Vendor is still obligated to indemnify, hold harmless and defend the AT&T Indemnified Parties, except that Vendor is not liable for any Litigation Expense that AT&T incurs before the time when notice is given or for any Loss or Liability to the extent that Vendor can show that such delay or failure to provide notice actually and materially prejudiced it in defending against such Loss or Liability.

(c) Vendor shall conduct the defense (employing one or more competent attorneys from a nationally recognized law firm), at Vendor's expense, against any claim, demand, suit or cause of action within the scope of Subsection (a) above, whether or not litigation is actually commenced or the allegations are meritorious and, upon AT&T's request, keep AT&T informed as to the progress of such defense. At its own option and expense, AT&T may employ separate counsel, including in- house counsel, to conduct the AT&T

Indemnified Parties' defense against such a claim. AT&T and Vendor shall cooperate in the defense of any such claim. Vendor may control the defense and settlement of such a claim, but if the settlement of a claim may have an adverse effect on any of the AT&T Indemnified Parties, then Vendor shall not settle such claim without the consent of AT&T, and AT&T shall not unreasonably withhold, condition or delay its consent. To the extent that Vendor pays any part of a judgment, award or settlement with respect to the Third Party Loss and any other expenses related to the resolution of the Third Party Loss, including costs, interest, and Attorneys' Fees, as a result of being self-insured (including any deductible) or as a result of insurance coverage being insufficient to cover the amount of the judgment, award or settlement, upon final resolution of the claim, demand, suit or cause of action, AT&T shall reimburse Vendor for the pro-rata portion of any such payment based on the AT&T Indemnified Parties' fault relative to Vendor's fault.

(d) In addition to AT&T's obligation to reimburse Vendor as set forth in Subsection (c) above, AT&T shall indemnify, hold harmless and defend the Vendor Indemnified Parties against any Third Party Loss arising solely from or in connection with, resulting solely from, or relating solely to (i) the AT&T Provided Equipment furnished by AT&T or (ii) the negligent or intentionally wrongful acts or omissions of any of the AT&T Indemnified Parties under this Agreement; in each case in the same manner as set forth in Subsection (b) and in the first four sentences of Subsection (c), with the appropriate changes having been made.

(e) Subject to AT&T's obligation to reimburse or indemnify Vendor as set forth in Subsection (c) and (d) above, respectively, Vendor shall bring no claim or action for indemnification, contribution, or subrogation against any of the AT&T Indemnified Parties nor shall Vendor implead any of them in any action brought by another, based on injury to the person or death arising out or relating to Vendor's performance under this Agreement. If, through any such action, Vendor ever acquires a Lien on a judgment against any of the AT&T Indemnified Parties, then Vendor shall assign such Lien to AT&T. Vendor waives any immunity from indemnification (only with respect to the AT&T Indemnified Parties) that Vendor may hold, by virtue of Vendor's compliance with its workers' compensation obligations in any jurisdiction, even if such immunity arises under the constitution or statutes of such jurisdiction.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section, the Parties intend that any amount for which any of the AT&T Indemnified Parties might otherwise have an obligation of reimbursement to Vendor for its pro-rata portion pursuant to this Section will be net of any insurance proceeds or other amounts paid by Vendor's insurance company ("Insurance Proceeds") that actually reduce the amount that Vendor is required to pay on account of a Third Party Loss. Accordingly, the amount with respect to which AT&T is required to reimburse Vendor its pro-rata portion will be reduced by any Insurance Proceeds theretofore actually paid on behalf of Vendor in respect of the related Third Party Loss. If Vendor receives a reimbursement required by this Section from AT&T in respect of the AT&T Indemnified Parties' pro-rata share

of the amount of any Third Party Loss and subsequently receives Insurance Proceeds or the benefit of any payments made for Vendor or on its behalf by any insurance company or other entity with respect to such Third Party Loss, then Vendor will pay to AT&T, within fifteen (15) days after such receipt of Insurance Proceeds or benefit of any payments, an amount equal to the excess of the reimbursement that Vendor received from AT&T over the amount of the reimbursement that would have been due under this Section from AT&T if the Insurance Proceeds had been received, realized or recovered before the reimbursement was made by AT&T. An insurer that would otherwise be obligated to pay any amount as a result of a Third Party Loss shall not be relieved of the responsibility with respect thereto or, by virtue of the indemnification or reimbursement provisions hereof, have any subrogation rights with respect thereto, it being expressly understood and agreed that no insurer or any other third party shall be entitled to a "wind-fall" (i.e., a benefit they would not be entitled to receive in the absence of the indemnification provisions) by virtue of the indemnification or reimbursement provisions hereof. Vendor shall have a good faith obligation to seek, and AT&T shall provide its reasonable cooperation to Vendor in its efforts, to collect or recover any Insurance Proceeds that may in any way be available to reduce the amount of any Third Party Loss.

3.16 Information

(a) In connection with this Agreement, including Vendor's performance of its obligations hereunder and AT&T's receipt of Work, either Party may find it beneficial to disclose to the other Party (which may include permitting or enabling the other Party's access to) certain of its Information. For the purpose of this clause, AT&T's disclosure of Information to Vendor includes any Information that Vendor receives, observes, collects, stores, or accesses, in any way, in connection with this Agreement and all such Information disclosed by AT&T hereunder shall be and shall remain the sole and exclusive property of AT&T. Information of a disclosing Party shall be deemed to be confidential or proprietary only if it is clearly marked or otherwise identified by the disclosing Party as being confidential or proprietary, provided that if it is orally or visually disclosed (including Information conveyed to an answering machine, voice mail box or similar medium), the disclosing Party shall designate it as confidential or proprietary at the time of such disclosure, however, failure to do so shall not prevent such Information from receiving the protections afforded to it in this Section 3.16. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a disclosing Party shall not have any such obligation to so mark or identify, or to so designate, Information that the disclosing Party discloses to or is otherwise obtained by the other Party's employees, contractors, or representatives (i) who are located on the disclosing Party's premises; (ii) who access the disclosing Party's systems; or (iii) who otherwise obtain AT&T Information and/or AT&T Customer Information in connection with this Agreement; any such Information so disclosed shall automatically be deemed to be confidential and proprietary. Additionally, the failure to mark or designate information as being confidential or proprietary will not waive the confidentiality where it is reasonably obvious, under the circumstances surrounding disclosure, that the Information is confidential or proprietary; any such Information so disclosed or obtained shall automatically be deemed to be confidential and proprietary. For greater certainty, Information provided by either Party to the other Party prior to the Effective Date of this Agreement in connection with a separate

non-disclosure agreement (howsoever denominated) is also subject to the terms of this Agreement. Neither Party shall disclose Information under this Agreement that includes, in any form, any of the following: customer or employee personal information, credit card and credit related information, health or financial information, and/or authentication credentials, without the express consent of the disclosing Party, which consent shall be in writing and signed by the disclosing party.

(b) With respect to the Information of the disclosing Party, the receiving Party shall:

(i) hold all such Information in confidence with the same degree of care with which it protects its own confidential or proprietary Information, but with no less than reasonably prudent care;

(ii) restrict disclosure of such Information solely to its and its Affiliates' employees, contractors, directors, advisors, financing sources and agents with a need to know such Information, advise such persons of their confidentiality obligations with respect thereto, and ensure that such persons are bound by obligations of confidentiality reasonably comparable to those imposed in this Agreement;

(iii) use such Information only as needed to perform its obligations (and, if AT&T is the receiving Party, to receive the benefits of the Work provided) under this Agreement;

(iv) except as necessary under the immediately preceding Subsection (iii), not copy, distribute, or otherwise use any such Information or allow anyone else to copy, distribute, or otherwise use such Information; and ensure that any and all copies bear the same notices or legends, if any, as the originals; and

3.17 Infringement

(a) Definitions. For purposes of this Section:

(i) "Infringement Loss" shall mean any Liability, loss, claim, demand, suit, cause of action, settlement payment, cost, expense, interest, award, judgment, damages (including punitive and exemplary damages and increased damages for willful infringement), Liens, fines, fees, penalties, and Litigation Expense.

(ii) "Provided Elements" shall mean any Material, Services or Deliverables or other products, hardware, software, interfaces, systems, content, services, processes, methods, documents, materials, data or information, or any functionality therein, provided to any AT&T Indemnified Party by or on behalf of Vendor (including by any of Vendor's Subcontractors or distributors or any Vendor Person) pursuant to this Agreement (including under any addendum, order, statement of work, exhibit, schedule or other document under, subordinate to, or referencing this Agreement); provided, however, that Provided Elements shall not include any AT&T Provided Equipment.

(b) Obligations.

(i) Vendor shall indemnify, hold harmless, and defend (which shall include cooperating with AT&T as set forth below in the defense of) each of the AT&T Indemnified Parties against any Infringement Loss or other Liability resulting from, arising out of or relating to any allegation, threat, demand, claim or lawsuit brought by any third party ("Covered Claim"), regardless of whether such Covered Claim is meritorious, of:

1. infringement (including direct, contributory and induced infringement) of any patent, copyright, trademark, service mark, or other Intellectual Property Right in connection with the Provided Elements, including any Covered Claim of infringement based on:

A. making, repair, receipt, use, importing, sale or disposal (and offers to do any of the foregoing) of Provided Elements (or having others do any of the foregoing, in whole or in part, on behalf of or at the direction of the AT&T Indemnified Parties), or

B. use of Provided Elements in combination with products, hardware, software, interfaces, systems, content, services, processes, methods, documents, materials, data or information not furnished by Vendor, including use in the form of the making, having made or using of an apparatus or system, or the making or practicing of a process or method unless the function performed by the Provided Elements in such combination is of a type that is neither normal nor reasonably anticipated for such Provided Elements (a "Combination Claim");

2. misappropriation of any trade secret, proprietary or non-public information in connection with the Provided Elements;

any and all such Infringement Loss or other Liabilities referenced in this Subsection (b)(i) being hereinafter referred to as a "Covered Loss."

(ii) Insofar as Vendor's obligations under Subsection (b)(i) result from, arise out of, or relate to a Covered Claim that is a Combination Claim, Vendor shall be liable to pay only its Proportionate Share of the Covered Loss associated with such Combination Claim. The "Proportionate Share" payable by Vendor shall be a portion of the Covered Loss determined, not at AT&T's sole discretion, but rather on an objectively fair and equitable basis (taking into account the relevant facts and circumstances and using the same standards that would be applied by a court or other neutral adjudicator under applicable Law) to be attributable to Vendor based on the relative materiality of the role played by the applicable Provided Elements in the Combination Claim. If Vendor believes AT&T's assessment of Vendor's Proportionate Share is not fair and equitable, then Vendor's Proportionate Share shall be determined, insofar as possible, through good faith negotiation between the Parties; provided, however, that a failure of the Parties to agree on Vendor's Proportionate Share shall not relieve Vendor of its obligations to pay its Proportionate Share under this Section. Vendor shall make payments in satisfaction of its Proportionate Share obligation whenever such payments become due. In no event shall Vendor be liable, with regard to a Combination Claim, for more than its Proportionate Share. If the Parties cannot mutually agree on Vendor's Proportionate Share within sixty (60) days of AT&T's providing Vendor with AT&T's assessment of Vendor's Proportionate Share, either Party may notify the other Party that a dispute has occurred, at which point the Parties shall follow the dispute resolution procedures set forth in Section 4.8 ("Dispute Resolution"), provided that in preparation for the escalation set forth in Section 4.8(a), Vendor shall notify AT&T in writing of the percentage which Vendor believes, in good faith, constitutes Vendor's Proportionate Share ("Vendor's Minimum Share"). If arbitration is invoked under Section 4.8(b), all arbitrators shall be qualified by education, training, and experience in both the intellectual property law (e.g., patent law) and the technology relevant to any dispute under this Section. Throughout the course of attempting to resolve the dispute, Vendor shall continue to pay Vendor's Minimum Share to AT&T as such payments become due. When Vendor's Proportionate Share is finally determined (either through escalation or arbitration, as the case may be) ("Determined Proportionate Share"), there shall be a true-up and Vendor shall promptly pay to AT&T the aggregate amount of past underpayments (i.e., the difference between monies previously due computed at the Determined Proportionate Share, minus those amounts that Vendor had actually paid to AT&T), if any. Thereafter, Vendor shall promptly pay its Determined Proportionate Share. (In the event that the Determined Proportionate Share is less than the Vendor's Minimum Share, AT&T shall refund to Vendor any past overpayments.) In no event shall AT&T's acceptance of payments computed at Vendor's Minimum Share prejudice or waive any of AT&T's rights under this Agreement.

(iii) AT&T shall have sole control over the defense of (1) any Combination Claim and (2) any other Covered Claim that involves Vendor and one or more other suppliers of AT&T or its Affiliates ((1) and (2) being hereinafter referred to separately and collectively as a "Compound Claim"). Vendor shall cooperate with AT&T to facilitate the defense and may, at its option and at its own expense, participate with AT&T in the defense with counsel of its own choosing. Where AT&T controls the defense under this Subsection (b)(iii), AT&T shall make good faith efforts to enter into a reasonable joint defense or common interest agreement with Vendor.

(iv) Insofar as Vendor's obligations under Subsection (b)(i) result from, arise out of, or relate to a Covered Claim other than a Compound Claim, Vendor shall have the discretion, but not the obligation, to control the defense of the Covered Claim. In the event that Vendor controls the defense of the Covered Claim, Vendor shall retain as its lead counsel, subject to AT&T's approval (which shall not be withheld, conditioned or delayed except for reasons of apparent or actual conflict of interest), one or more competent attorneys from a nationally recognized law firm who have significant experience in litigating intellectual property claims of the type at issue, and the AT&T Indemnified Parties may, at their option and sole expense, participate with Vendor in the defense of such Covered Claim.

(v) AT&T shall notify Vendor promptly of any Covered Claim; provided, however, that any delay in such notice shall not relieve Vendor of its obligations under this Section, except insofar as Vendor can show that such delay actually and materially prejudiced Vendor.

(vi) In no event shall Vendor settle, without AT&T's prior written consent, any Covered Claim, in whole or in part, in a manner that would require any AT&T Indemnified Party to discontinue or materially modify its products or services (or offerings thereof). In no event shall Vendor enter into any agreement related to any Covered Claim or to the Intellectual Property Rights asserted therein that discharges or mitigates Vendor's liability to the third-party claimant but fails to fully discharge all of AT&T's liabilities as to the Covered Loss.

(c) Continued Use of Provided Elements Upon Injunction. Without in any manner limiting the foregoing indemnification, if, as a result of a Covered Claim, (i) the AT&T Indemnified Parties' rights under this Agreement are restricted or diminished, or (ii) an injunction, exclusion order, or other order from a court, arbitrator or other competent tribunal or governmental authority preventing or restricting the AT&T Indemnified Parties' use or enjoyment of the Provided Elements is issued, imminent, or reasonably likely to be issued, then, in addition to its other obligations set forth in this Section, Vendor, in any case at its sole expense (or, in the case of a Combination Claim, at its fairly and equitably apportioned expense) and at no loss, cost or damage to the AT&T Indemnified Parties or their customers, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain for the AT&T Indemnified Parties the right to continue using or conducting other activities with respect to the Provided Elements (or, in the case of a Combination Claim, shall use commercially reasonable efforts, in cooperation as reasonably needed with other interested parties, to obtain for the AT&T Indemnified Parties the right to continue using or conducting other activities with respect to the Provided Elements in the combination at issue); provided that if Vendor is unable to obtain such right, then Vendor

shall, after consulting with and obtaining the written approval of the AT&T Indemnified Parties, provide modified or replacement non-infringing Provided Elements that are (or, in the case of a Combination Claim, shall use commercially reasonable efforts, in cooperation as reasonably needed with other interested parties, to provide a modified or replacement non- infringing combination, with the Provided Elements being modified or replaced as needed therein, that is) equally suitable and functionally equivalent while retaining the quality of the original Provided Elements and complying fully with all the representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement and all Specifications; provided further that if Vendor is unable in this way to provide such modified or replacement non-infringing Provided Elements, then AT&T shall have the right, at its option and without prejudice to any other rights or remedies that AT&T has in contract, law or equity: (1) to exercise any of the Termination Remedies set forth in the Build Addendum and to terminate AT&T's obligations under this Agreement with respect to the impacted Cell Sites and receive a reduction in the Maintenance Fees with respect to such Cell Site(s), and/or (2) to require Vendor, as applicable, to remove, accept return of, or discontinue the provision of the Provided Elements, to refund to AT&T the purchase price thereof or other monies paid therefor (subject, in the case of Provided Elements other than services, to reduction based on the amount of depreciation or amortization over the useful life of the Provided Elements at issue), and to reimburse AT&T for any and all reasonable out-of- pocket expenses of removing, returning or discontinuing such Provided Elements.

(d) Elimination of Charges. After AT&T ceases, as a result of actual or claimed infringement or misappropriation, to exercise the rights granted under this Agreement with respect to the Provided Elements, AT&T has no obligation to pay Vendor any Structured Payments or Maintenance Fees that would otherwise be due under this Agreement for such rights.

(e) Exceptions. Vendor shall have no liability or obligation to any of the AT&T Indemnified Parties for that portion of a Covered Loss which is based on (and only to the extent such portion is based on):

(i) use of the Provided Elements by the AT&T Indemnified Parties in a manner that constitutes a material breach of this Agreement; or

(ii) an unauthorized modification of the Provided Elements by an AT&T Indemnified Party; or

(iii) Vendor's conformance to the AT&T Indemnified Party's written specifications, unless any one or more of the following is true:

1. there was a technically feasible non-infringing means of complying with those specifications, unless Vendor can show that, at the time of such compliance, such non- infringing means would have been cost-prohibitive (whether on an individual Cell Site basis, or across multiple Cell Sites as set forth in the Build Addendum); or

2. the relevant specifications are designed to bring the Provided Elements into compliance with, or have the Provided Elements conform to, an industry standard, which standard is promulgated by a generally recognized industry standards-setting body and which standard is not required for compliance with an applicable law, ordinance, regulation,

3. products, services, or other items that substantially meet such written specifications, and that in other respects are substantially similar to the Provided Elements are typically provided by or on behalf of Vendor to third parties in connection with Services substantially similar to those provided herein; or

4. the relevant specifications for the Provided Elements are of Vendor's (or one or more of its sub- suppliers') origin, design, or selection.

(f) OTHER LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY NOT APPLICABLE. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION IN THIS AGREEMENT TO THE CONTRARY (AND WHETHER OR NOT SUCH A PROVISION CONTAINS LANGUAGE TO THE EFFECT THAT THE PROVISION TAKES PRECEDENCE OVER OTHER PROVISIONS CONTRARY TO IT), WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, NONE OF THE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY (INCLUDING ANY LIMITATIONS REGARDING TYPES OF OR AMOUNTS OF DAMAGES OR LIABILITIES) CONTAINED ANYWHERE IN THIS AGREEMENT WILL APPLY TO VENDOR'S OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS SECTION.

(i) maintain the insurance coverages and limits required by this Section and any additional insurance and/or bonds required by Laws:

1. at all times during the term of this Agreement and until completion of all Work associated with this Agreement, whichever is later; and

2. with respect to any coverage maintained in a "claims-made" policy, for two (2) years following the term of this Agreement or completion of all Work associated with this Agreement, whichever is later.

(b) The Parties agree that:

(i) the failure of AT&T to request such certificate of insurance or failure of AT&T to identify a deficiency will not be construed as a waiver of Vendor's obligation to maintain the insurance required under this Agreement;

(ii) the insurance required under this Agreement does not represent that coverage and limits will necessarily be adequate to protect Vendor, nor shall it be deemed as a limitation on Vendor's liability to AT&T in this Agreement;

The Vendor invoice must specify in detail, if applicable, (i) quantities of each item of Material, Deliverable, and Services, (ii) prices of each item of Material, Deliverable, and Services, (iii) whether the item is taxable and the amount of tax per item, (iv) total amounts for each item, (v) total amount of applicable sales or use taxes, (vi) discounts, if any, (vii) shipping charges, if any, (viii) total amount due, (ix) remit to address, (x) description of Material, Deliverables, and Services, and (xi) special service charges, if any. Each invoice shall specifically reference that the invoice will be paid in accordance with the terms set forth in this Agreement and all payments for amounts due on such invoice for Material, Deliverables, and Services provided under the Build Addendum will be made in accordance with the Structured Payments Schedule attached as Schedule 3 to the Build Addendum. AT&T will promptly review such invoice and, unless AT&T disputes in good faith the amounts set forth therein, will promptly acknowledge that the Structured Payment set forth therein is due in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Build Addendum. In the event that AT&T disputes in good faith any amounts set forth in any such invoice, AT&T shall give written notice of such disputed amounts to Vendor prior to the due date of the first Structure Payment set forth in such invoice. Vendor will provide a payment request to AT&T on a monthly basis on the first day of each calendar month for the Structured Payments set forth in the Build Addendum and the Maintenance Fees set forth in the Maintenance Addendum, in each case as provided in the respective addendum.

3.21 Limitation of Damages. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, neither Party shall be liable to the other Party for any special, consequential, incidental or punitive damages, however caused, based on any theory of liability except to the extent such damages are payable by such Party (a) pursuant to its indemnification obligations under Section 3.15 and infringement indemnification obligations under Section 3.17, (b) arising out of or resulting from such Party's breach of its confidentiality obligations set forth in this Agreement (including Section 3.16, Section 3.48, Section 4.2 and Exhibit A attached hereto) or (c) in connection with a Third Party Loss arising out of or resulting from such Party's violation of applicable Law.

3.22 Offset Right. Any amounts payable (including any recoupment claims or other amounts to be reimbursed) by Vendor or its Affiliates to AT&T or its Affiliates under this Agreement (including under the Build Addendum or the Maintenance Addendum) may be offset against the Maintenance Fees or any payment due or to become due to Vendor or its Affiliates from AT&T or its Affiliates under the Transport Agreement, Master License Agreement; provided, however, that AT&T's offset right under this Section 3.22 shall not apply to any Structured Payments for any Cell Site that has reached Location Acceptance and AT&T hereby waives all such rights of setoff and recoupment against such Structured Payments. Prior to exercising its right to offset amounts pursuant to this Section 3.22, AT&T shall provide written notice to Vendor of its intention to offset such amounts and to the extent any dispute between the Parties exists in respect of the amount to be offset, AT&T must first utilize the Escalation Procedure in Section 4.8(a).

3.23 Material and Services Furnished by Vendor and AT&T. Vendor shall furnish all Services, including individuals to provide field and administrative support, and Vendor shall furnish all Material required to perform the Work, except those items specifically listed in this Agreement, the Build Addendum or the Maintenance Addendum to be furnished by AT&T. Any material provided by AT&T shall remain AT&T's material and shall be used only in connection with Work under this Agreement. Vendor shall protect and preserve AT&T's material and shall promptly return at the end of contracted Work, at Vendor's expense, any material not used, unless AT&T instructs Vendor otherwise in writing. AT&T shall receive full title and ownership rights to all Material furnished by Vendor relating to any Cell Site upon Location Acceptance of such Cell Site.

3.24 Non-Exclusive Market. Other than with respect to the Cell Sites expressly contemplated in the Build Addendum, this Agreement does not grant Vendor any right or privilege to provide to AT&T any Work of the type described in or purchased under this Agreement in any market or geographic area. Except for obligations arising under the Build Addendum or the Maintenance Addendum and any work orders or trouble tickets thereunder that have not been terminated as provided herein, this Agreement does not obligate AT&T to purchase or license any such Work from Vendor.

Vendor shall promptly notify AT&T of any of the following which is connected with any Deliverables: (a) any material investigation, indictment, lawsuit, or administrative or other proceeding, or (b) the revocation of any license, permit or other document issued to Vendor by any governmental authority necessary for Vendor to complete its obligations as set forth herein. Prior to Location Acceptance of all Cell Sites pursuant to the Build Addendum, Vendor must notify AT&T immediately (and in any event within three (3) business days) in writing, if it breaches (or is given written notice of an alleged breach or prospective breach of) a material covenant in any material financial or material operational arrangement of Vendor. Following Location Acceptance of all Cell Sites pursuant to the Build Addendum, Vendor must notify AT&T immediately (and in any event within three (3) business days) in writing, if it breaches (or is given written notice of an alleged breach or prospective breach of) a material covenant in any material financial or material operational arrangement of Vendor that could reasonably be expected to adversely impact Vendor's ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement.

This Agreement shall govern in lieu of all other pre-printed or standardized provisions that may otherwise appear in any other paper or electronic record of either Party (such as standard terms on order or acknowledgment forms, advance shipping notices, invoices, time sheets, and packages, shrink wrap terms, and click wrap terms).

3.29 Ownership of Paid-For Development, Use and Reservation of Rights

(a) Paid-For Development. AT&T shall be the exclusive owner of all right, title, and interest in and to all Paid- For Development (defined below), including, without limitation, all Intellectual Property Rights therein and thereto. Vendor shall assign or have assigned to AT&T and hereby assigns to AT&T all Intellectual Property Rights in and to the Paid-For Development. "Paid- For Development" shall mean any and all Items to the extent produced or developed by or on behalf of Vendor or its employees, agents, or direct or indirect contractors or suppliers (and whether completed or in-progress), and forming part of any Deliverable, Material or Service pursuant to this Agreement (including, without limitation, under the Build Addendum, Maintenance Addendum or any statement of work, exhibit, schedule, order or other document under, subordinate to, or referencing this Agreement) for which AT&T has been or will be charged Structured Payments, Maintenance Fees or any monies in connection with a Change Order. Paid-For Development shall always include (without limitation) any modifications, alterations or updates that fall within the definition of Paid-For Development but shall not

include any Items produced by Vendor for its own use in connection with performance of the Services and for which AT&T has not been charged.

(b) License Grant to AT&T. Vendor hereby grants and promises to grant and have granted to AT&T and its Affiliates a royalty-free, nonexclusive, sublicensable, assignable, transferable, irrevocable, perpetual, world- wide license in and to any applicable Intellectual Property Rights of Vendor to use, copy, modify, distribute, display, perform, import, make, sell, offer to sell, and exploit (and have others do any of the foregoing on or for AT&T's or any of its customers' behalf or benefit) any Intellectual Property Rights of Vendor or any third party that are not included in Material or Paid-For Development but necessary to operate the Cell Sites or receive the full benefit of the Work.

(c) Further Acts and Obligations. Vendor will take or secure such action (including, but not limited to, the execution, acknowledgment, delivery and assistance in preparation of documents or the giving of testimony) as may be reasonably requested by AT&T to evidence, transfer, perfect, vest or confirm AT&T's right, title and interest in any Paid-For Development. Vendor shall, in all events and without the need of AT&T's request, secure all Intellectual Property Rights in any Paid-For Development (and any licenses specified above) from each employee, agent, Subcontractor or sub-contractor of Vendor who has or will have any rights in the Paid- For Development or Intellectual Property Rights.

(d) Reservation of Rights and Limited License. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, AT&T is not transferring or granting to Vendor any right, title, or interest in or to (or granting to Vendor any license or other permissions in or to) any or all: (i) Items created by or on behalf of AT&T or directly or indirectly provided to Vendor (in any form, including, without limitation, verbally) by or on behalf of AT&T or its third party providers, including the AT&T Provided Equipment (as such term is defined in the Build Addendum) ("AT&T Provided Items"); (ii) Paid-For Development or (iii) Intellectual Property Rights, including, without limitation, any Intellectual Property Rights in or to any AT&T Provided Items or Paid- For Development. The sole exception to the foregoing reservation of rights is that AT&T hereby grants Vendor a limited, nonexclusive, non-transferable license (that shall automatically terminate upon the termination or expiration of this Agreement), under any rights owned by AT&T, to use the AT&T Provided Items and Paid- For Development solely as instructed by AT&T and to the extent necessary for Vendor to perform its obligations under this Agreement, subject further to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. In no way expanding the foregoing license, said license in no manner permits Vendor to (and Vendor hereby promises not to without the explicit prior written and signed consent of AT&T Intellectual Property, LLC ("ATTIP Consent")) make use of any AT&T Provided Items, Paid- For Development or AT&T Intellectual Property Rights either for the benefit of any third party or other than as instructed in writing by AT&T (AT&T may be willing, in its sole discretion, to grant ATTIP Consent in exchange for appropriate additional compensation). Paid-For Development and AT&T Provided Items shall constitute AT&T Information under this Agreement.

3.30 Publicity. Other than use of AT&T's name in connection with Permit applications, Vendor shall not use AT&T's or its Affiliates' names, trademarks, service marks, designs,

logos or symbols. In addition, Vendor shall not use any language or pictures which could in AT&T's judgment imply AT&T's or its Affiliates' identities, or endorsement by AT&T, its Affiliates or any of its or their employees, in any (i) written, electronic, or oral advertising or presentation, or sales meeting, or (ii) brochure, newsletter, book, electronic database, testimonial quotation, thank you letter, reference letter or other communication of whatever nature, without prior written ATTIP Consent.

Vendor and its employees, agents, and Subcontractors shall refer any questions from the media or third parties regarding the Work to AT&T and shall not discuss the Work with the media or third parties, without the prior written ATTIP Consent. For the purpose of clarity, any disclosure of the existence of this Agreement or the Work by Vendor as required by Law, including the regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, shall not be a violation of this section; provided that, prior to any such disclosure being made in the first instance, Vendor shall give AT&T a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon (including any press release). To the extent that any disclosure required to be made by Vendor to the Securities and Exchange Commission has been previously reviewed by AT&T, then Vendor shall not be required to provide AT&T with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon prior to such disclosure being made thereafter so long as no substantive changes have been made thereto. A breach of this "Publicity" Section shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement.

3.31 Records and Audits

(a) Vendor shall maintain complete and accurate records relating to the Work and the performance of this Agreement. AT&T and its auditors (including internal audit staff and external auditors) and governmental authorities shall have the right to review such records ("AT&T Audits") held and created by Vendor, to verify the following:

(i) the accuracy of Vendor's invoices and AT&T's payment obligations hereunder;

(ii) that the Work charged for was actually performed;

(iii) that the Services have been and are being provided in accordance with this Agreement;

(iv) the integrity of Vendor's systems that process, store, support, maintain, and transmit AT&T data;

(v) Vendor's records relating to the performance of Vendor's Subcontractors with respect to any portion of the Services; and

(vi) that Vendor and its Subcontractors are complying with Section 3.6 hereof.

When the FirstNet Authority or other governmental authority requests to review Vendor's records, AT&T and its auditors will review these records first if the FirstNet Authority or other governmental authority permits such review, and provide the records to the requesting governmental authority; provided, however, the FirstNet Authority and other governmental authorities retain the right to perform audits independent of AT&T.

(b) Subject to Subsection (g) below, Vendor shall provide and shall require that its Subcontractors provide to AT&T, its auditors (including internal audit staff and external auditors), and governmental authorities access at all reasonable times to:

(i) any facility at which the Services or any portion thereof are being performed;

(ii) systems and assets used to provide the Services or any portion thereof;

(iii) Vendor employees and Subcontractor employees providing the Services or any portion thereof; and

(iv) all Vendor and Subcontractor records, including financial records relating to the invoices and payment obligations and supporting documentation, pertaining to the Services.

The scope of AT&T Audits shall also include:

(i) practices and procedures used in performing the Services;

(ii) systems, communications and information technology used in performing the Services;

(iii) general controls and security practices and procedures;

(iv) supporting information and calculations regarding invoices and compliance with service requirements;

(v) quality initiatives and quality assurance; and

(vi) compliance with the terms of this Agreement.

AT&T's access to the records and other supporting documentation shall include the right to inspect and photocopy Vendor's documentation and the documentation of its Subcontractors as provided to Vendor, and the right to retain copies thereof outside of their physical location with appropriate safeguards, if such retention is deemed reasonably necessary by AT&T and only to the extent that all such records are maintained by AT&T in accordance with Section 3.16 hereof.

(c) AT&T Audits may be conducted once a year (or more frequently if requested by governmental authorities who regulate AT&T's business, if required by applicable Law or if auditors require follow-up access to complete audit inquiries or if an audit uncovers any problems or deficiencies), upon at least ten (10) business days advance notice (unless otherwise mandated by Law) and during business hours. Vendor will cooperate, and will ensure that its Subcontractors cooperate, in the AT&T Audits, and will make the information reasonably required to conduct the AT&T Audits available on a timely basis.

(d) If, as a result of an AT&T Audit, AT&T determines that Vendor has not performed or has unsatisfactorily performed any obligation under this Agreement, then Vendor will promptly remedy the non-performance or unsatisfactory performance.

(e) Vendor will maintain and retain the records set forth in Subsection (a) during the term of the Agreement and for three (3) years thereafter (unless a discovery or legal hold request is made with respect to such records, in which case Vendor shall retain such records until AT&T notifies Vendor that such discovery or legal hold request has expired). Vendor will provide AT&T, at AT&T's request and cost, with paper and electronic copies of documents and information reasonably necessary to verify Vendor's compliance with this Agreement. Upon notification by AT&T of a discovery or legal hold request, Vendor shall fully cooperate with such request and immediately preserve any Vendor records covered by such request and promptly provide such Vendor records requested by AT&T related to the inquiry.

(f) Except as provided in Subsection (d), all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by AT&T in connection with an AT&T Audit shall be paid by AT&T. Vendor shall be solely responsible for all costs and expenses incurred by Vendor in connection with its obligations under this Section. In the event that either Party requires that an audit be performed by an independent auditor, unless otherwise specified herein, the Party requesting such independent auditor will be responsible for the costs and expenses associated with the independent auditor.

(g) With respect to AT&T requests for audits or inspections of Vendor's Subcontractors, the following applies:

(i) If Vendor's agreement with its applicable Subcontractor permits an AT&T Audit, AT&T shall be permitted to conduct such audit directly or through a third party representative. Vendor shall work with AT&T in facilitating the Subcontractor's cooperation for an expeditious and thorough audit or inspection.

(ii) If Vendor's contract with its applicable Subcontractor precludes AT&T from directly conducting an audit or inspection, Vendor shall use reasonable best efforts to enable AT&T to perform an audit of the Subcontractor with Vendor coordinating the audit process. Failing those efforts, Vendor shall, upon AT&T's request and at AT&T's expense, conduct the audit or inspection on behalf of AT&T, subject to terms agreed to by Vendor and AT&T for the Subcontractor audit, such as areas to be audited, applicable fees, and the timeframe for reporting audit results to AT&T. If AT&T's request for a Vendor audit or inspection arises from, in AT&T's good faith opinion, materially or consistently deficient Service provided by the Subcontractor under AT&T's account, and the audit in both Parties' opinions confirms such deficiencies, Vendor shall not charge AT&T a fee for the Vendor's audit of its Subcontractor.

(iii) If Vendor's contract with its applicable Subcontractor does not allow Vendor access to the facilities and systems of Subcontractor required to conduct the audit described in Subsection (b) above, then Vendor shall provide a list of such Subcontractors and the services being provided by such Subcontractor to AT&T for its review. To the extent AT&T deems it reasonably necessary to require such access, then Vendor will renegotiate its contract with the applicable Subcontractor in order to obtain the audit rights described in Subsection (b) above.

3.32 Restricted Entities. Vendor may not deliver or obtain any Material or Deliverables from or use any Restricted Entities to provide any Services under this Agreement, without prior written consent from AT&T. Vendor may not use, in connection with any Deliverable, Material or Service provided hereunder, any element, equipment, location, instrumentality or the like where a Restricted Entity has a security interest in that element, equipment, location, instrumentality or the like. Vendor may not obtain financing from any Restricted Entity or use any Cell Sites or Material owned, leased from, operated or financed by any Restricted Entity.

3.33 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the Parties agree that the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force if both the economic and legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not affected in any manner that is materially adverse to either Party by severing the provision determined to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable.

3.34 Supplier Citizenship and Sustainability. Vendor shall conduct business with an abiding respect for corporate citizenship, sustainability, and human rights ("Citizenship and Sustainability"). Upon AT&T's request, which request may only be made once per calendar year, Vendor shall provide to AT&T reasonable information, reports, or survey responses to demonstrate Vendor's operation of its business in the context of Citizenship and Sustainability.

3.35 Survival of Obligations. Obligations and rights under this Agreement that by their nature would reasonably continue beyond the termination or expiration of this Agreement (including those in the Sections entitled "Compliance with Laws," "Construction and Interpretation," "Cumulative Remedies," "Entire Agreement," "Governing Law," "Information," "Indemnity," "Infringement," "Insurance," "Limitation of Damages," "Order of Precedence," "Ownership of Paid-For Development, Use and Reservation of Rights," "Publicity," "Severability," "AT&T Supplier Information Security Requirements (SISR)," "Warranty," "Customer Information," "Dispute Resolution" and the representations, warranties, indemnities and Termination Remedies) will survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement.

3.36 Taxes

(a) Vendor shall invoice AT&T the amount of any federal excise, state, and local transaction taxes imposed upon the sale of Material, Delivery of Deliverables, and provision of Services under this Agreement. All such taxes must be stated as separate items on the applicable Material, Deliverable, or Services invoice listing the taxing jurisdiction imposing the tax. Installation, labor and other non-taxable charges must be separately stated. AT&T shall pay all applicable taxes to Vendor that are stated on and at the time the Material, Deliverables, or Services invoice is submitted by Vendor. Vendor shall remit taxes to the appropriate taxing authorities. Vendor shall honor tax exemption certificates, and other appropriate documents, which AT&T provides to Vendor, pursuant to relevant tax provisions of the taxing jurisdiction providing the exemption.

(b) Vendor will pay any penalty, interest, additional tax, or other charge that may be levied or assessed as a result of the delay or failure of Vendor, for any reason other than AT&T's failure to reimburse Vendor in a timely manner for such amounts, to pay any tax or file any return or information required by law, rule, or regulation or by this Agreement to be paid or filed by Vendor.

(c) Upon AT&T's request, the Parties shall consult with respect to the basis and rates upon which Vendor shall pay any taxes or fees for which AT&T is obligated to reimburse Vendor under this Agreement. If AT&T determines that, in good faith and pursuant to applicable Law, any such taxes or fees are not payable or should be paid on a basis less than the full price or at rates less than the full tax rate, AT&T shall notify Vendor in writing of such determinations, Vendor shall make payment in accordance with such determinations, and AT&T shall be responsible for such determinations. If collection is sought by the taxing authority for a greater amount of taxes than that so determined by AT&T, Vendor shall promptly notify AT&T. If AT&T desires to contest such collection, AT&T shall promptly notify Vendor. Vendor shall cooperate with AT&T in contesting such determination, but AT&T shall be responsible and shall reimburse Vendor for any tax, interest, or penalty in excess of AT&T's determination and shall reimburse Vendor for Litigation Expense incurred by Vendor in connection with contesting such determination.

(d) If the parties agree, where such agreement shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed, that AT&T has paid Vendor for any taxes in excess of the amount that AT&T is obligated to pay Vendor under this Agreement, AT&T and Vendor shall consult in good faith to determine the appropriate method(s) to seek recovery of such excess payments, which method(s) may include, but are not limited to, (i) Vendor crediting any excess payments against tax amounts or other payments due from AT&T solely to the extent Vendor has successfully made corresponding adjustments to its payments to the relevant tax authority, (ii) Vendor timely filing claims for refund and any other documents required to recover any excess payments and Vendor promptly remitting to AT&T all such refunds and interest received, and (iii) Vendor immediately refunding to AT&T such excess payments.

(e) If any taxing authority advises Vendor that it intends to audit Vendor with respect to any taxes for which AT&T is obligated to reimburse Vendor under this Agreement, Vendor shall (i) promptly so notify AT&T, (ii) afford AT&T an opportunity to participate with Vendor in such audit with respect to such taxes, and (iii) keep AT&T fully informed as to the progress of such audit. Except as set forth in Subsection (c) above, each Party shall bear its own expenses with respect to any such audit, and the responsibility for any additional tax, interest, or penalty resulting from such audit is to be determined in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Section 3.36. Vendor's failure to comply with the notification requirements of this Section 3.36 will relieve AT&T of its responsibility to reimburse Vendor for taxes only to the extent that Vendor's failure actually and materially prejudiced AT&T's ability to contest imposition or assessment of those taxes.

(f) In addition to its rights under Subsections (c), (d), and (e) above with respect to any tax or tax controversy covered by this Section 3.36, AT&T is entitled to contest, pursuant to applicable Law and tariffs and at its own expense, any tax previously invoiced that AT&T is ultimately

obligated to pay. AT&T is entitled to the benefit of any refund or recovery of amounts actually received by AT&T or Vendor that AT&T has previously paid to Vendor resulting from such a contest. Vendor shall cooperate in any such contest, but AT&T shall reimburse Vendor for Litigation Expense incurred by Vendor in obtaining a refund or credit for AT&T.

(g) If either Party is audited by a taxing authority or other governmental entity in connection with taxes under this Section 3.36, the other Party shall reasonably cooperate with the Party being audited in order to respond to any audit inquiries in an appropriate and timely manner, so that the audit and any resulting controversy may be resolved expeditiously.

(h) AT&T and Vendor shall reasonably cooperate with each other with respect to any tax planning to minimize taxes.

(i) Vendor and any of its Affiliates, as appropriate, receiving payments hereunder shall provide AT&T with a valid United States Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") Form W-8BEN, W-8BEN- E, W-8ECI, W-8EXP, W- 8IMY, or W-9 (or any successor form prescribed by the IRS). AT&T may reduce any payment otherwise due to Vendor in connection with the sale of Material, Delivery of Deliverables, or provision of Services under this Agreement by the amount of any tax imposed on Vendor that AT&T is required to pay directly to a taxing or other governmental authority ("Withholding Tax"). Alternatively, if applicable Law permits, AT&T agrees that it will honor a valid exemption certificate or other mandated document evidencing Vendor's exemption from payment of, or liability for, any Withholding Tax as authorized or required by statute, regulation, administrative pronouncement, or other Law of the jurisdiction providing said exemption. AT&T shall provide Vendor with documentation evidencing withholding in a reasonable time.

3.37 Termination and Suspension

(a) Mutual Agreement - This Agreement, the Build Addendum and/or the Maintenance Addendum may be terminated at any time upon the mutual written consent of the Parties.

(b) Termination for Convenience - This Agreement, the Build Addendum and the Maintenance Addendum may not be terminated by either Party at any time for its own convenience.

(c) Termination for Cause

(i) If either Party breaches any provision of this Agreement (which for purposes of this Section 3.37(c) shall not mean any breaches of the Build Addendum or Maintenance Addendum) and (i) if the breach is one that by its nature could be cured, and such breach is not cured within thirty (30) days (or such other applicable cure period expressly provided herein and applicable to such breach) after the breaching Party receives written notice, provided that if such breach is not reasonably susceptible of cure within such thirty (30) day period (or such other applicable cure period) and Vendor is diligently and continuously pursuing a cure, the Parties shall cooperate in good faith to establish by mutual written agreement a reasonable extension of the applicable cure period, or (ii) if the breach is one that by its nature cannot be cured, or (iii) if the breach is a material violation of Laws that is not reasonably susceptible of cure, then, in addition to all other rights and remedies at law or

in equity or otherwise, the non-breaching Party shall have the right upon written notice to immediately terminate this Agreement (which termination shall include the Build Addendum and Maintenance Addendum), and exercise all Termination Remedies set forth in the Build Addendum, except AT&T cannot terminate its obligation to pay Vendor all Structured Payments for Cell Sites that have achieved Location Acceptance prior to the effective date of termination or any Maintenance Fees for Services performed under the Maintenance Addendum prior to the effective date of such termination. Failure of the non- breaching Party to immediately terminate this Agreement (x) following a breach which continues longer than such cure period, provided such breach has not been cured prior to the non-breaching Party's providing notice of termination, or (y) following a breach that cannot be cured or that constitutes a material violation of Laws that is not reasonably susceptible to cure shall not constitute a waiver of the non- breaching Party's rights to terminate.

(ii) If Vendor becomes insolvent or generally fails to pay, or admits in writing its inability or refusal to pay, debts as they become due, then AT&T shall have the right upon written notice to immediately terminate AT&T's obligations under this Agreement or the Build Addendum or Maintenance Addendum, as applicable, and exercise all Termination Remedies set forth in the Build Addendum.

(iii) If (1) Vendor (A) receives a notice of default (or similar breach or violation) and has not cured such default (or similar breach or violation) within thirty (30) days from the receipt of such notice or (B) is in default under any credit facility or other financing arrangement, (2) any Vendor credit facility or other financing arrangement has been terminated or suspended (other than by Vendor or as a result of an expiration in accordance with its terms) or (3) Vendor no longer has access to funding under any credit facility or other financing arrangement required by Vendor to fulfill its obligations to AT&T under this Agreement, the Master License Agreement, the Transport Agreement and the Roaming Agreement (as such term is defined in the Build Addendum), then Vendor shall promptly, but no later than one (1) business day following Vendor's receipt of notice of any such event, notify AT&T of such event and in addition to all other rights and remedies at law or in equity or otherwise, AT&T shall have the right upon written notice to immediately terminate AT&T's obligations under this Agreement or the Build Addendum or Maintenance Addendum, as applicable, and exercise all Termination Remedies set forth in the Build Addendum; provided, that prior to exercising such termination right, AT&T shall enter into good faith discussions with Vendor to determine if Vendor can obtain alternative financing.

(d) Bankruptcy. In addition to all other termination rights set forth herein, this Agreement may be terminated by either Party or either Party may terminate its obligations hereunder, in each case in whole or in part (including terminating only specific addendums or specific Cell Sites), if the other Party files, or has filed against it, any voluntary petition seeking liquidation, reorganization, arrangement or readjustment of its debts or for any other relief under the United States Bankruptcy Code or under any other act or Law pertaining to insolvency or debtor relief, whether state, federal or foreign, now or hereafter existing; or such other Party has filed against

it any petition which petition seeks any of the foregoing relief or substantive consolidation of the assets of such other Party with a debtor in bankruptcy or liquidation and which is not dismissed within forty-five (45) days after the effective service of same; or the appointment is made of a receiver, custodian or trustee of such other Party or for all or a substantial part of the assets of such other Party.

(e) Termination Events. In addition to all other termination rights set forth herein, this Agreement may be terminated by AT&T or AT&T may terminate its obligations hereunder (including terminating only specific addendums or specific Cell Sites), upon the occurrence of (i) any Termination Event (as defined in the Build Addendum) applicable to one or more Cell Sites and upon such termination AT&T may exercise any or all of the Termination Remedies (as defined in the Build Addendum) available to it pursuant to the Build Addendum with respect to such impacted Cell Sites; or (ii) any termination (regardless of the reason therefor) of the Master License Agreement resulting in AT&T's inability to use the impacted Cell Site.

(f) Partial Termination - Whenever Law or a provision of this Agreement permits AT&T to terminate this Agreement with respect to a single Cell Site or group of Cell Sites or with respect to either the Build Addendum or Maintenance Addendum, AT&T may, at its option, terminate this Agreement in part with respect to such Addendum or on a Cell Site basis without further liability or obligation; provided that no such termination shall relieve AT&T's obligation to make Structured Payments with respect to any Cell Sites that have reached Location Acceptance prior to the effective date of such termination and pay any Maintenance Fees for Services performed under the Maintenance Addendum prior to the effective date of such termination. The Parties acknowledge that the Build Addendum and Maintenance Addendum include specific partial termination rights on a Cell Site by Cell Site basis, including the Termination Remedies that allow for termination of AT&T's obligations with respect to an individual Cell Site hereunder and special remedies to AT&T in connection with such termination.

(g) Termination Charges - AT&T shall not be liable for any termination charges (or any charges for any Material or Services already ordered or performed at the time of termination) in any case when any termination results from a termination right granted to AT&T in this Agreement; provided that AT&T shall remain obligated to make Structured Payments with respect to any Cell Sites that have reached Location Acceptance prior to the effective date of such termination and pay any Maintenance Fees for Services performed under the Maintenance Addendum prior to the effective date of such termination.

(h) Obligations upon Expiration or Termination - Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, but prior to the effectiveness of full termination of the Agreement, AT&T may exercise any rights and remedies available to AT&T under this Agreement, at law or in equity, including AT&T's right to exercise any one or more of the Termination Remedies set forth in the Build Addendum, and Vendor shall, upon the request and at the expense (other than termination in accordance with Subsection (c) hereof) of AT&T: (i) return all papers, materials, equipment, assets and property of AT&T held by Vendor, including title and ownership to all Material, (ii) provide reasonable assistance as may be necessary for the orderly, non-disrupted continuation of the Services, (iii) transfer all of the contracts related to the Cell Sites to AT&T

(a) For purposes of this Section, "FOSS" means any and all freeware, open source software or shareware used or included in, or combined by or on behalf of Vendor with, the Deliverables or otherwise provided by or on behalf of Vendor under this Agreement; and a "FOSS Disclosure" means a complete, current, and accurate listing of all FOSS, which identifies for each FOSS component: (i) the component name; (ii) its version or release number; (iii) its web site URL of origin; (iv) the applicable software license and its version number; (v) the URL where Vendor identifies or sets forth the applicable software license; (vi) a brief (e.g., one- line) description of the purpose of the component; and (vii) how the component is linked within the Deliverables or as otherwise provided. A FOSS Disclosure may be provided in the form of a web site made accessible to AT&T where Vendor posts the foregoing information.

furnished. Neither response nor non-response by AT&T concerning the receipt or non-receipt of any FOSS Disclosure or any reference to FOSS in the Agreement shall be deemed as acceptance, approval or acquiescence by AT&T that Vendor's use of the FOSS complies with the legal requirements of applicable FOSS license(s), or is suitable for the intent and purposes furnished hereunder. After receiving any FOSS Disclosure, AT&T may, upon written notice to Vendor, ask Vendor to use alternate FOSS (or other alternate software), if reasonably warranted to avert a risk that the rights of AT&T or its third-party Contractors in any proprietary software may be compromised. In that event, if Vendor cannot or will not use such alternate FOSS, then AT&T may immediately terminate the relevant purchase or funding commitments under this Agreement, without further cost, expense or liability to AT&T.

(c) Vendor represents and warrants to AT&T: (i) that Vendor has satisfied all its obligations to any third parties with respect to all FOSS and the applicable FOSS licenses (including, for example, any obligation to make publicly available the FOSS source code for modifications to such FOSS); (ii) that the FOSS, in the form provided to AT&T, is suitable for the intent and purposes furnished hereunder; (iii) that use of the FOSS in such form for such intent and purposes in no manner creates any added obligation on the part of AT&T (including, for example, the payment of any additional monies), or diminishes, conditions or eliminates any of the rights, title, or interest that Vendor grants AT&T in or to any Deliverables or that Vendor may otherwise provide AT&T under this Agreement; and (iv) that use of the FOSS in such form for such intent and purposes, including, but not limited to, AT&T's use or combination of the FOSS, in the form provided to AT&T, with any proprietary software of AT&T or AT&T's third-party Contractors, does not subject AT&T to any obligation of disclosure or distribution to any third party or to the public of any such proprietary software, or otherwise make such proprietary software subject to the terms of any FOSS license or impair AT&T's or its third-party Contractors' rights, title, or interest in or to such proprietary software.

(d) In the event that AT&T notifies Vendor or Vendor becomes aware of Vendor's noncompliance with any FOSS license term, then in either case, Vendor shall use all reasonable efforts promptly to cure such noncompliance so as to eliminate risks of public disclosure of proprietary software and prevent disruption of any AT&T business activity. Vendor shall promptly notify AT&T of all actions taken by Vendor to cure such noncompliance. Should AT&T receive notice from any third party alleging acts or omissions which, notwithstanding AT&T's use of the FOSS for the intent and purposes furnished hereunder, constitute noncompliance with any FOSS license term, then promptly upon AT&T's notice to Vendor of such allegation, Vendor shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless AT&T against such allegation in accordance with Vendor's obligations to do so as set forth elsewhere in this Agreement, in a manner that preserves any proprietary software of AT&T or its third-party Contractors from any public disclosure obligation or any other FOSS license noncompliance allegations.
