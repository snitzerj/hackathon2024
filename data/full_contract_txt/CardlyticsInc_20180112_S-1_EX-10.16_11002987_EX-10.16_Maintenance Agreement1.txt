Except as otherwise specifically provided, neither Party shall initiate arbitration, mediation or litigation unless and until this dispute resolution procedure has been substantially compiled with or waived. Failure of a Party to fulfill its obligations in this Section, including failure to meet timely upon the other Party's notice, shall be deemed such a waiver.

  37.0 MEDIATION/ARBITRATION

37.1 If the Parties are unable to resolve a dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement in accordance with the Section entitled "Dispute Resolution," the Parties will in good faith attempt to resolve such dispute through non-binding mediation. The mediation shall be conducted before a mediator acceptable to both sides, who shall be an attorney or retired judge practicing in the areas of banking and/or information technology law. The mediation shall be held In Charlotte, N.C., provided, however, a dispute relating to infringement of Intellectual Property Rights or the Section entitled "Confidentiality and Information Protection" shall not be subject to this Section entitled "Mediation/Arbitration."

37.2 Any controversy or claim, other than those specifically excluded, between or among the Parties not resolved through mediation under the preceding provision, shall at the request of a Party be determined by arbitration. The arbitration shall be conducted by one independent arbitrator who shall be an attorney or retired judge practicing in the areas of banking and/or Information technology law. The arbitration shall be held in Charlotte, N.C. in accordance with the United States Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. 1 et seq.), notwithstanding any choice of law provision in this Agreement, and under the auspices and the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association.

37.3 Consistent with the expedited nature of arbitration, each Party will, upon the written request of the other Party, promptly provide the other with copies of documents relevant to the issues raised by any claim or counterclaim on which the producing Party may rely in support of or in opposition to any claim or defense. At the request of a Party, the arbitrator shall have the discretion to order examination by deposition of witnesses to the extent the arbitrator deems such additional discovery relevant and appropriate. Depositions shall be limited to a maximum of three (3) per Party and shall be held within thirty (30) calendar days of the making of a request.

37.5 No provision of this Section shall limit the right of a Party to obtain provisional or ancillary remedies from a court of competent jurisdiction before, after, or during the pendency of any arbitration. The exercise of a remedy does not waive the right of either Party to resort to arbitration.
