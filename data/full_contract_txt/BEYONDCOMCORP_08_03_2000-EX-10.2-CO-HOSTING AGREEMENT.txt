Date: September 21, 1998





                                    2    3

                     TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF AGREEMENT

1.   LOCATION. During the Term (as defined in Section 6 (a) below), NAI shall      provide the following marketing considerations to Co-Host:

  (a)  Co-Hosting Rights. Co-Host shall be permitted to maintain on the           Online Service Page (as defined in Part 2 of Exhibit "A") of the           Originating Locations in the manner set forth on Exhibit "B" hereto           (and on such other positions as are set forth on Exhibit "B" or as the           parties may mutually agree upon in writing from time to time) a hot           link to Internet locations specified by the Co-Host (the           "Destination") from which Goods (other than Competitor's Goods           (hereinafter defined)) may be sold. The web pages at the Destination           shall be maintained in accordance with the requirements of this           Agreement, including without limitation, Section 2 hereof.           "Competitor's Goods" as used herein shall mean the Goods of any of the           persons or entities described on Part 1 of Exhibit "C" attached hereto           and made a part hereof. The Destination shall not contain any links to           any third party sites for the purchase of Competitor's Goods; provided           that the Destination will link to the Co-Host Site (which will sell           Competitor's Goods).

  (b)  Exclusive Positioning. Co-Host shall be the exclusive reseller of           software products ("Software") at the Originating Locations. The           preceding sentence shall not prohibit NAI from (i) reselling Software           including NAI Goods (hereinafter defined) from the McAfee Mall; (ii)           referencing and linking to sites of strategic partners (other than           competitors of Co-Host listed on Part 2 of Exhibit "C") which may also           be involved in the resale of Software from such sites; provided that           no Software may be purchased on the page of such site which is linked           to any Originating Location and further provided that the references           and links to the sites of strategic partners shall not be placed on           the Online Service Page; and (iii) advertising Software with banners,           buttons and other forms of online advertising; provided that any link           from such advertising takes the end user to the publisher of the           Software and not a reseller of Goods (other than Co-Host). For           example, an advertising banner or button for the Windows 98 software           program may link back to the website of Microsoft Corporation but not           the website of Dell Computer Corporation which is reselling the           program. Without limitation on the foregoing, NAI may co-host a           comparative shopping service on the Originating Locations. NAI will           obtain a written covenant that the comparative shopping co-host will           present sellers of Software in a neutral manner and upon request of           Co-Host will require removal or alteration of presentations by such           co-host on such co-hosted facility which Co-Host reasonably deems to           be non-neutral; provided, however, that, notwithstanding the           foregoing, Co-Host may be the featured or most prominent Software           reseller on any such service.

  (c)  Short Term Product Exclusives. For a period of fourteen (14) days           following release of any new NAI Goods or major version releases           (i.e., version 3.0 to 4.0) of existing NAI Goods, Co-Host shall be the           exclusive online seller of any such

                                    3    4

       release released during the Term. "NAI Goods" as used herein shall           mean retail desktop software products offered by NAI under the           "McAfee" brand or other NAI owned brand, which NAI makes available for           resale through distributors and resellers via the Internet.

  (d)  Reference Site. Co-Host may refer to the Originating Locations as a           Co-Host customer location and to NAI as a Co-Host customer hereunder           provided all such references shall be subject to the prior review and           approval of NAI, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld.

  (e)  Links to Online Service Page. Any end user accessing the principal           URLs of NAI (e.g., mcafee.com, cybermedia.com, pgp.com, tis.com) shall           be taken to the Online Service Page. Any end user accessing a "buy"           button on any of the Originating Locations shall be taken to the           Online Service Page. NAI shall not sell retail desktop consumer           products, including without limitation, NAI Goods from the NAI           Internet Sites (other than the McAfee Mall).

       NAI reserves the right to change the URL of the Originating Locations           from time to time and agrees to give Co-Host as much notice of any           such change as is practicable.

2.   MARKETING AND SALES.

  (a)  Placement of Order. In consideration of the Co-Hosting Fee set forth           in Part 3 of Exhibit "A", NAI shall provide the marketing           consideration identified in Section 1 during the Term of this





       Agreement.

  (b)  Advertising Materials; Destination Operation. Co-Host shall provide to           NAI artwork and text materials with respect to the advertisement of           the Destination at the Originating Locations. Such artwork and           materials must be non-infringing, inoffensive, accurate, truthful and           otherwise comply with all applicable laws. Co-Host shall comply with           all applicable laws in connection with the operation of the           Destination, including without limitation, requirements regarding the           confidentiality of information concerning end users. NAI retains the           right, but not the obligation, to disapprove or remove any           advertisements or advertising materials it reasonably deems illegal,           inappropriate or otherwise inconsistent with the purposes of the           Originating Sites, without the consent of Co-Host.

  (c)  Use of Trademarks. Co-Host hereby grants to NAI a non-exclusive,           non-transferable, royalty-free license during the term of this           Agreement to use the trademarks, service marks and trade names of           Co-Host in connection with the advertising and promotion of the Goods           from the Originating Locations, provided that NAI complies with the           terms of Section 9(b) of the Web Site Services Agreement (as defined           below). Co-Host reserves the right to terminate the foregoing right,           after giving NAI notice and opportunity to cure the allegedly harmful           use, if in Co-Host's reasonable judgment, NAI's use of such           trademarks, service marks and trade names harms the business, image or           goodwill of Co-Host.

                                    4    5

  (d)  Limited Duty of Promotion. NAI shall have no duty or obligation to           advertise or promote the Goods, other than as set forth in this           Section 2. Except as expressly set forth herein (including, without           limitation, as set forth in this Section 2(d)), NAI does not,           expressly or impliedly, guaranty or warrant any results or level of           sales or customer leads to Co-Host. NAI reserves the right to cease           publication of the Originating Locations for brief periods from time           to time for maintenance or other purposes; provided that the           Originating Locations will comply with the same "Uptime Requirements"           specified with respect to the "Managed Site" in the Web Site Services           Agreement.

  (e)  Marketing Promotions. During the Term, Co-Host and NAI will regularly           discuss and implement mutually agreed upon jointly funded marketing           promotions. NAI and Co-Host hereby agree that the marketing promotions           set forth on Exhibit "D" hereto will be implemented as set forth on           Exhibit "D".

  (f)  Distribution of Physical Products. NAI grants to Co-Host the right to           distribute physical copies of NAI's Goods to end users ordering from           the Managed Site, the Destination or Beyond.com upon the terms set           forth in Exhibit "E" attached hereto and made a part hereof.

3.   PAYMENT AND RECORDS.

  (a)  Fees. Subject to the provisions of Section 6 hereof, Co-Host shall pay           to NAI the amount designated in Part 3 of Exhibit "A" as the           Co-Hosting Fee upon the schedule set forth in such Part.

  (b)  Payment Terms. Except as set forth in such Part 3 of Exhibit "A",           payments from Co-Host to NAI shall be due thirty (30) days from the           date of invoice. All payments will be made in United States dollars,           free of any taxes then currently applicable, at the address designated           above by NAI. Late payments shall bear interest at the lesser of: (i)           the maximum rate permitted by law, and (ii) the rate of 1.5% per month           from the due date until paid.

4.   EQUITABLE RELIEF. Each party acknowledges that any breach of its      obligations under this Agreement with respect to the proprietary rights or      confidential information of the other party will cause the other party      irreparable injury for which there are inadequate remedies at law, and      therefore such other party will be entitled to equitable relief in addition      to all other remedies provided by this Agreement or available at law.

5.   PROPRIETARY RIGHTS. NAI retains ownership of the NAI Internet Site, the      Originating Locations, the trademarks and all intellectual property rights      in connection with the NAI Internet Site, including without limitation, its      URL designations and all rights from InterNIC in connection therewith.      Co-Host and its licensors retain ownership of all intellectual property      rights in the advertising materials provided, the trademarks and all      intellectual property rights in connection with the Destination and the      Co-Host Site, including, without limitation, its URL designations and all      rights from InterNIC in connection therewith, and all of its other      intellectual property rights.

                                    5    6

6.   TERM AND TERMINATION.

  (a)  Term. This Agreement will commence on the Effective Date, and will           terminate on the third anniversary of the Effective Date (the "Term"),           unless earlier terminated as provided in this Agreement.





  (b)  Termination. A party may terminate this Agreement immediately: (i) if           the other party engages in any material unlawful business practice and           such practice continues uncured thirty (30) days following written           notice thereof, (ii) if the other party fails to perform any material           obligation, (which shall include, without limitation, the payment           obligations hereunder and compliance with the Uptime Requirements in           respect of the Originating Locations) or violates any material           restriction contained in this Agreement and such failure continues           uncured thirty (30) days following written notice thereof, (iii) by           such party if that certain Web Site Services Agreement between NAI and           Co-Host dated of even date herewith (the "Web Site Services           Agreement") or the ESD Agreement is terminated by the other party,           (iv) if a receiver is appointed for the other party or its property,           (v) if the other party makes an assignment for the benefit of           creditors, (vi) if the other party becomes the subject of any           proceeding under any bankruptcy, insolvency or debtor's relief law,           (vii) upon ninety (90) days prior notice in writing by Co-Host at any           time after June 30, 2000, if the term of the Web Site Services           Agreement has not been renewed for an additional term of one (1) year           or more pursuant to its terms or (viii) if the party terminates the           Web Site Services Agreement by reason of the other party's material           default thereunder.

  (c)  Effect of Termination. Upon the effective date of the termination, all           outstanding invoices and other invoicable amounts will become due and           payable. Co-Host's contractual right to the marketing consideration           shall cease immediately upon the effective date of the termination.           Termination or expiration of this Agreement if by reason of material           breach by Co-Host shall not affect any of Co-Host's payment           obligations, all of which survive termination of this Agreement;           provided that, in (i) the event of termination of this Agreement by           Co-Host due to a material default by NAI, NAI shall pay to the Co-Host           the Liquidated Damages Amount (as defined in Part 2 of Exhibit "A").

7.   CONFIDENTIALITY. Confidential Information disclosed by either party in      writing and marked as "confidential," proprietary" or the like (or      disclosed verbally if a written summary is provided within thirty days),      including any information relating to such party's research, development,      proprietary technology, product and marketing plans, finances, personnel      and business opportunities will be considered confidential information.      Each party will not use the other party's confidential information except      as required to achieve the objectives of this Agreement and will not      disclose such confidential information except to employees, agents and      contractors who have a need to know in the discharge of their duties under      this Agreement. Such restrictions will not apply to information that      becomes public knowledge other than through the disclosing party, is      independently developed by the non-disclosing party, or is lawfully      required to be disclosed by any governmental agency or otherwise required      to be disclosed by law.

                                    6    7

  Neither party will make any disclosure of, or statement covering, the terms      of this Agreement, including the financial terms, to any third parties      (other than its attorneys, accountants and professional consultants),      without obtaining the other's prior written consent, except as required by      court order or applicable regulatory authorities, including without      limitation, the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange      Commission, any stock exchange and the NASDAQ. The parties agree that under      their current understanding, disclosure of the financial terms of this      Agreement is not required under the foregoing rules and regulations. The      obligations of this Section 7 shall survive the termination of this      Agreement, under any circumstances. The parties shall make a joint press      release announcing the relationship, the timing and content of which shall      be subject to the mutual agreement of the parties.

8.   RELATIONSHIP OF THE PARTIES. The parties are independent contractors and      not partners, joint venturers or agents, and neither party may obligate the      other to any warranty or other obligation. Neither NAI nor Co-Host is by      virtue of this Agreement authorized as an agent or other representative of      the other party.

9.   REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND INDEMNIFICATION.

  (a)  Co-Host represents and warrants to NAI that Co-Host has all right,           title, ownership interest and/or marketing rights necessary to provide           the advertising materials to NAI, to perform its obligations hereunder           and to operate the Destination. Each party further represents and           warrants to the other that it has not entered into any agreements or           commitments which are inconsistent with or in conflict with the rights           granted or obligations incurred by the representing party in this           Agreement. Co-Host further represents and warrants that the           advertising materials supplied hereunder do not infringe any Covered           Country (hereinafter defined) copyright, trademark, or trade secret           right. Covered Country shall mean the United States of America and any           member state of the European Economic Union. Co-Host agrees that, if           notified promptly in writing and given sole control of the defense and           all related settlement negotiations, it will defend NAI, its           employees, officers and agents, against any claim based on an           allegation that (i) advertising materials supplied hereunder infringes           a Covered Country patent, copyright, trademark or state trade secret           right, or (ii) Co-Host violated any law, statute or ordinance or any           governmental or administrative order, rule or regulation with regard





       to the advertising materials, the operation of the Destination or the           manufacture, possession, distribution, use or sale of the Goods.           Co-Host will pay any resulting costs, damages and attorneys' fees           finally awarded by a court, or agreed to in settlement by Co-Host,           with respect to any such claims. NAI agrees that, if the advertising           materials become, or in Co-Host's opinion are likely to become, the           subject of an infringement claim, NAI will permit Co-Host, at           Co-Host's option and expense, to, among other things, procure the           right for NAI to continue marketing and using the advertising           materials, or to replace or modify them so that they become           non-infringing.

                                    7    8

  (b)  NAI represents and warrants that NAI has all right, title, ownership           interest and/or marketing rights necessary to operate the Originating           Locations, provide the Products to Co-Host, and the Products shall be           free and clear of all liens and encumbrances. NAI further represents           and warrants that it has not entered into any agreements or           commitments which are inconsistent with or in conflict with the rights           granted to Co-Host in this Agreement. NAI further represents and           warrants that the Products supplied hereunder do not infringe any           Covered Country patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret right.           NAI agrees that, if notified promptly in writing and given sole           control of the defense and all related settlement negotiations, it           will defend Co-Host, its employees, officers and agents against any           claim based on an allegation that (i) a Product supplied hereunder           infringes a Covered Country patent, copyright, trademark or trade           secret right, or (ii) NAI violated any law, statute or ordinance or           any governmental or administrative order, rule or regulation with           regard to a Product or its manufacturer, possession, use or sale. NAI           will pay any resulting costs, damages and attorneys' fees finally           awarded by a court, or agreed to in settlement by NAI, with respect to           any such claims to the extent of the compensation received under this           Agreement. Co-Host agrees that, if the Products in the inventory of           Co-Host, or the operation thereof, become, or in NAI's opinion are           likely to become, the subject of an infringement claim, Co-Host will           permit NAI, at NAI's option and expense, to, among other things,           procure the right for Co-Host to continue marketing and using such           Products, or to replace or modify them so that they become           non-infringing. If neither of the foregoing alternatives is available           on terms that NAI deems reasonable, Co-Host will return such Products           on written request from NAI. NAI will grant Co-Host a credit equal to           the price paid by Co-Host for such returned Products, as adjusted for           discounts, returns and credits actually given, provided that such           returned Products are in an undamaged condition.

  (c)  No Combination Claims. Notwithstanding Section 9(b), NAI will not be           liable to Co-Host for any claims to the extent they arise solely based           upon the combination, operation or use of any Product with equipment,           data or programming not supplied by NAI, or to the extent they arise           solely based upon the alteration or modification of the Products by           the Co-Host or the purchaser of such Products.

  (g)  If a court of law finds any provision of this Agreement unenforceable,           the parties agree to modify such provision to the extent necessary to           make it legal and enforceable while preserving its intent and the           economic effect of the unenforceable provision.

                           DISTRIBUTION ADDENDUM

  WHEREAS, NAI owns and/or markets certain computer software and hardware products set forth on Exhibit "A" ("Products").

  WHEREAS, Co-Host is an independent reseller of computer products to end users ordering products through web sites on the Internet operated by Co-Host.

  WHEREAS, Co-Host distributes electronic copies of the Products pursuant to the ESD Agreement.

  WHEREAS, Co-Host desires to distribute the Products and NAI desires to make the Products available to Co-Host for further distribution.

  THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, and of the mutual covenants and agreements hereinafter set forth, NAI and Co-Host enter into the following additional agreements regarding the Products:

1.   APPOINTMENT. NAI appoints Co-Host as a non-exclusive distributor of the      Products to end users ordering the Products from the Destination or the      Co-Host Site, and Co-Host accepts this appointment. Co-Host shall      distribute the Products, as an independent reseller, at its own risk and      expense and subject to any such prices, contractual terms and conditions as      Co-Host may from time to time determine. Nothing in this Agreement shall      prohibit Co-Host from distributing competing products in the Territory. The      "Territory" as that term is used herein shall mean all countries in the      world except countries to which export or re-export of any Product, or the      direct products of any Product is prohibited by United States law without      first obtaining the permission of the United States Office of Export      Administration or its successor. Co-Host shall not have the right to assign      or otherwise transfer this Agreement or any rights herein granted to any      other person or entity, except by operation of law or in connection with      the sale of all of its assets, or the acquisition of the Co-Host by a third      party. Any such attempted assignment shall be void and the Agreement shall      remain in effect.

2.   DISTRIBUTION. Co-Host has the right to market and distribute the Products      subject to the license agreement that accompanies such Product. Co-Host may





  not engage in the rental of any of the Products. Co-Host shall not in any      event remove from or obscure upon any Products any labels placed thereon by      NAI containing statements of restrictions upon distribution, without the      prior written consent of NAI. NAI reserves the right in its sole discretion      and without liability to Co-Host to add additional Products, change the      prices for the Products pursuant to Section 5, modify the Products, change      the level of NAI's support for the Products and discontinue the      availability of any Product. Any addition or deletion from the list of      Products will be indicated by NAI's revision to the NAI price list, and NAI      will use reasonable efforts to provide Co-Host with thirty (30) days notice      prior to the effective date of such changes indicated on the NAI price      list.

                                    2    17

3.   MARKETING.

  (a)  General. Co-Host will use commercially reasonable efforts to market           the Products it orders to the best of its ability, and to that end           will (i) conduct marketing activities authorized by NAI, (ii) support           special promotions initiated by NAI, and (iii) maintain a sound           financial condition. Co-Host will conduct its business in a manner           that reflects favorably upon the Products and NAI.

  (b)  Advertising; Use of Trademarks. Co-Host may advertise and promote the           Products in a commercially reasonable manner and, subject to the           provisions of Section 5 of the Co-Hosting Agreement, may use           trademarks, service marks and trade names provided by NAI in           connection therewith, provided that all such promotions and           advertising will be consistent with NAI's general quality standards           and the provisions of Section 5 of the Co-Hosting Agreement. Unless           otherwise agreed upon in writing by NAI, Co-Host will submit each           advertisement and promotion to NAI for trademark review and approval           prior to initial release, which approval will not be unreasonably           delayed or withheld. All such usage which was not expressly approved           by NAI must be terminated immediately upon receipt of notice from NAI           to that effect.

  (c)  Trademarks Rights. NAI owns any and all trademarks, trade names, and           service marks for the Products (as noted in Section 5 of the           Co-Hosting Agreement). Such trademarks, trade names, and service marks           shall include all product names, the names "Network Associates,"           logos, designs, and other designations or brands used by NAI in           connection with the Products. Co-Host acknowledges and agrees that NAI           is not granting to Co-Host any rights in any Product trademark, trade           name, or service mark in or outside of the Territory.

4.   INSPECTIONS, RECORDS AND REPORTING.

  (a)  Sales Out Reports. Co-Host will provide to NAI within ten (10) days           after the end of each calendar month, a computer media data file in           the format established by NAI showing, for such month, Co-Host's total           sales, by customer and by Product from each location. If requested by           NAI, Co-Host shall provide such reports with respect to weekly periods           or bi-weekly periods prior to the end of the calendar month in which           such period occurs.

  (b)  Inventory Level Reports. Co-Host will provide to NAI on Monday of each           week, a computer media data file in the format established by NAI           showing Co-Host's current inventory levels of each Product (including           items in transit), and weekly runrate snapshots and the other           information reasonably requested by NAI.

  (c)  Records. For three (3) years after each calendar quarter during the           term of this Agreement, Co-Host will keep, at Co-Host's office, full           and accurate books of account and copies of all documents and other           materials for such quarter relating to this Agreement and Co-Host's           records, accounts and contracts relating to the distribution of the           Products.

                                    3    18

  (d)  Audit. NAI may inspect the records described in Sections 4(c) upon           demand from time to time. In addition, Co-Host agrees to allow NAI's           independent auditors to audit and analyze appropriate accounting           records of Co-Host from time to time (but not more than one every six           (6) months) to ensure compliance with all terms of this Agreement. Any           such audit shall be permitted by Co-Host within fifteen (15) days of           Co-Host's receipt of NAI's written request to audit, during normal           business hours. The cost of such an audit will be borne by NAI unless           a material discrepancy indicating inadequate record keeping or that           additional fees due to NAI are discovered, in which case the cost of           the audit shall be borne by Co-Host. A discrepancy shall be deemed           material if it involves payment or adjustment of more than five           percent of the amount reported in favor of NAI. Audits and inspections           shall not interfere unreasonably with Co-Host's business activities.]

5.   ORDERING AND PAYMENT.

  (a)  NAI's Acceptance. Any order for delivery of physical product placed





       with NAI is subject to acceptance by NAI within ten (10) days           following receipt by NAI. NAI may decline any order, in whole or in           part, and unless NAI accepts an order in writing, the order is           considered accepted only to the extent it is fulfilled.] The terms and           conditions of this Agreement and of the applicable NAI invoice or           confirmation will apply to each order accepted or shipped by NAI.           Electronic confirmation from an authorized NAI email address shall           have the same effect as a signed written confirmation. The provisions           of Co-Host's form of purchase order or other business forms will not           apply to any order notwithstanding NAI's acknowledgment or acceptance           of such order.

  (b)  Price to Co-Host. NAI will inform Co-Host as to its current suggested           retail price of the Products and standard discount or pricing granted           to NAI's traditional product distributors. During the term of this           Agreement, Co-Host will be invoiced on the basis of the discounts set           forth on Exhibit "A" of this Distribution Addendum. Discounts off           suggested retail price (SRP) for standard NAI Products shall exclude           tradeups, upgrade SKUs and special promotions, unless otherwise           indicated. NAI may change its SRP from time to time upon written           notice to Co-Host, which may take the form of a revised price list,           and NAI may notify Co-Host of a different discount from SRP in the           event NAI offers special promotional SRPs or Product prices in NAI's           discretion.

  (c)  Price Increase. If NAI increases its suggested retail price for any           Product (a product upgrade with a different part number will not be           the same Product) and there is a resulting increase in the price of           Products to Co-Host, NAI will give Co-Host thirty (30) days advance           notice of the effective date of any such increase and:

       (i)  NAI will honor the old price for any shipments of such Product                already in transit to Co-Host;

                                    4    19

       (ii) All additional orders following such thirty (30) day period will                be shipped at the new price;

      (iii) NAI has orders for such Product from Co-Host already booked into                NAI's order entry system at the time of such price increase or if                Co-Host orders additional Products during such thirty (30) day                period, then the price increase will not apply to that portion of                such orders which call for shipments of not more than the monthly                average quantity of such Products shipped to Co-Host in the three                month period preceding the date of the increase; and

       (iv) Orders for such Product in NAI's order entry system in excess of                the quantity specified in (iii) above will be shipped at the new                price unless they are canceled by Co-Host by written notice to                NAI, provided that such notice is received by NAI no later than                fifteen (15) days prior to the date of shipment specified in such                order.

  (d)  Price Decrease. If NAI decreases its suggested retail price for any           Product (a product upgrade with a different part number will not be           the same Product), the decrease will apply to all units of such           Product in Co-Host's inventory and orders in transit to Co-Host from           NAI that are in an unopened, salable condition as of the effective           date of the decrease, provided that such Products had been shipped to           Co-Host no more than ninety (90) days prior to such effective date. To           be eligible for such price protection, Co-Host must deliver to NAI           written evidence, signed by Co-Host, of an inventory of such Products           showing the number and location of each unit of Product for which           Co-Host claims price protection eligibility hereunder within thirty           (30) days of receiving notice of such price decreases. Such reduction           will constitute a credit on Co-Host's account for future orders from           NAI under this Agreement (unless the Agreement has terminated or           expired in which case such reduction will be refunded to the extent           that Co-Host does not owe NAI money) in an amount equal to the           difference between the net invoice price at which each such unit in           inventory was provided to Co-Host and the current price then           applicable for shipments of such Product to Co-Host hereunder.

  (e)  TAXES.

       (i)  All amounts payable by Co-Host to NAI under this Agreement are                exclusive of any tax, withholding tax, levy, or similar                governmental charge that may be assessed by any jurisdiction in                or outside the Territory except income and similar taxes levied                on and payable by NAI.

       NAI, for Products which have been returned by end users as defective,           or pursuant to the warranty stated in NAI's end user license. Such           credit will be in an amount equal to the original invoice price less           any discounts or other credits previously received. Co-Host shall also           have the ability to return for credit Products which have boxes that           are or become damaged, unless such damage was caused by Co-Host.

  (c)  Discontinued Products. Co-Host may, during the term of this Agreement,           obtain a credit for the price paid by Co-Host to be applied against           current or future invoices, for all versions of Products shipped by           NAI within the previous ninety (90) days that NAI discontinues or           which are removed from NAI's current retail price list. Such credit           will be equal to the price paid by Co-Host for such obsolete Products,           less discounts received under Section 5 of this Agreements. All such           discontinued Products will be counted and inspected at the Inspection           Site by NAI's employee, and upon NAI's acceptance thereof (which will           be a condition of Co-Host's eligibility for a credit hereunder) such           Products will be promptly and completely destroyed or, if requested by           NAI, such Products or any portion thereof will be returned to NAI as           it directs. No Product shall be deemed discontinued if a later version           of the Product is still being offered by NAI and end users may obtain           the current version of such Product from NAI electronically at no           additional charge.

  (d)  Freight. Co-Host will pay all costs (including freight) associated           with the return of the Products to NAI and back to Co-Host as provided           herein, except that NAI will be responsible for all freight costs           associated with (i) the return of Products under Section 7(b), (ii)           the return of any discontinued or obsolete Products under Section           7(c), and (iii) the return of other Product updates agreed upon by NAI           and Co-Host.

  (b)  Co-Host acknowledges that some NAI Products hereto contain encryption           and some are export restricted (the "Restricted Software") by the U.S.           Department of Commerce's Bureau of Export Administration (BXA).           Co-Host further acknowledges that for this reason, the export of such           items may subject the Co-Host or its executives to fines and/or other           severe penalties. Unless all required permits and/or approvals have           been obtained, Co-Host shall not export or re-export the Restricted           Software outside of the United States, whether directly or indirectly,           and will not cause, approve or otherwise facilitate others such as           agents, subsequent purchasers, licensees or any other third parties in           doing so. The parties agree to cooperate with each other with respect           to any application for any required licenses and approvals. However,           Co-Host acknowledges it is their ultimate responsibility to comply           with all export laws with respect to the Restricted Software and that           NAI has no further responsibility after the initial sale to the           Co-Host within the United States.
