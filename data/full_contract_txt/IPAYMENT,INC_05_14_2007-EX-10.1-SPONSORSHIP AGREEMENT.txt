Any and all processing and related services rendered by SERVICERS to an Approved Merchant in the Merchant Portfolio covered by this Agreement (including without limitation Merchants initially processed under the TS ISO Agreement and the PCS ISO Agreement) will be rendered pursuant to and billed at the rates set forth in the Service Agreement. Any and all sponsorship, clearing and related services rendered by SERVICERS in connection with an Approved Merchant in the Merchant Portfolio covered by this Agreement (including without limitation Merchants initially processed under the TS ISO Agreement and the PCS ISO Agreement) will be rendered pursuant to and billed at the rates set forth in this Agreement. Any Approved Merchant added to the Merchant Portfolio and Program covered by this Agreement will be subject to all terms and conditions of this Agreement.

  (b)   Any service described in this Agreement is subject to periodic revision by SERVICERS to reflect changes (i) to the SERVICERS' systems or the services provided by SERVICERS and offered generally to SERVICERS' customers and (ii) in the specific services provided to ISO; provided, however, that SERVICERS will not implement any changes or improvements to the services if such action will materially degrade the quality of the services being provided to ISO by SERVICERS hereunder unless such change is required by the VISA or MasterCard rules and regulations.

  (c)   SERVICERS may from time to time pass through to ISO actual increases in the Pass-Through Costs and Interchange, to reflect any increases in such fees, costs and charges to SERVICERS, upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to ISO (or, if SERVICERS receive less than thirty (30) days notice of such increase, as much prior notice as is practicable under the circumstances).

Page 7







  (d)   In the event of any fee increases to ISO, SERVICERS shall provide reasonable assistance to ISO in passing such fee increases through to Merchants under the Merchant Processing Agreements.

  (e)   From time to time and in their sole discretion, SERVICERS may also perform certain risk management services, such as periodic credit reviews, fraud reviews and monitoring and collections, with respect to Applicants and Approved Merchants; provided, however, that SERVICERS will not contact such Applicants or Approved Merchants directly and will request any reasonably necessary information or documentation from ISO. SERVICERS' participation in any such activity shall not in any way relieve ISO from its responsibility for credit and fraud losses which may result from or be related to the Program.

  (f)   SERVICERS will provide ISO with a point of contact to address issues that arise in connection with this Agreement, which will be one or more employees of FDMS.

2.2  ISO Obligations.

It is understood that (at all times) SERVICERS have the ultimate approval right for ISO's solicitation procedures, Application Materials, Application processing procedures, Merchant qualification criteria, transaction processing procedures, Merchant Processing Agreements, Program terms, Program Participation Fees, and other Program policies, all of which must be approved in advance by SERVICERS in writing.

  (c)   ISO will use reasonable efforts to convert the sponsorship and clearing of all Merchants processing on the FDMS system under the Service Agreement to the sponsorship and clearing of Bank under the terms and conditions of this Agreement; provided, however, that ISO will not be required to attempt to convert any such Merchants if the Merchant refuses to be sponsored by Bank, if the applicable Other MSP or IC refuses to board accounts on the FDMS System or be sponsored by Bank, or if the conversion of such merchants would not make economic or strategic business sense to ISO.

  (d)   For the avoidance of doubt, the parties acknowledge that ISO may utilize SERVICERS' services under this Agreement on a non- exclusive basis and there are no minimum fees or utilization commitments under this Agreement.

Page 8

ISO shall be responsible, and shall reimburse SERVICERS, for all actual, documented fees and costs imposed by third parties associated with obtaining, installing and maintaining the BIN/ICA on the FDMS system, including any Visa and MasterCard fees and assessments. Upon a Program Transfer in accordance with Section 10.4, Bank will transfer the dedicated BINs/ICAs used in connection with the Program to a Visa and MasterCard Member designated by ISO.

  (a)   Except as expressly set forth herein, ISO shall not subcontract, assign, license or in any other manner extend or transfer to any third party any right or obligation ISO has with respect to SERVICERS' Program.

If ISO desires to use the services of an individual independent contractor who represents himself or herself as working for ISO using ISO's legal/business name ("IC"), then ISO shall enter into a written agreement with each such IC that (i) requires the IC to comply with all applicable terms of this Agreement and all applicable Rules, laws and regulations, and (ii) prohibits the making of any representation or creating any liability on behalf of SERVICERS.

  (b)   ISO's currently utilizes the Other MSP's and IC's listed on Exhibit E attached hereto in its Merchant processing business. The parties agree to work together expeditiously and in good faith to transfer the registration or re-register all such entities with the appropriate Bank Card associations as required under the Rules. All Other MSP's must be appropriately registered before boarding accounts under Bank's sponsorship.

2.5  SERVICERS' Obligations.

  (a)   Bank will sponsor ISO, at ISO's expense, as an ISO for Visa, as an MSP for MasterCard and, to the extent applicable, as similarly required for all other Bank Card associations and, to the extent required by any Bank Card association, Bank also agrees to sponsor for registration with Visa and/or MasterCard those Other MSP's, IC's, subsidiaries and marketing representatives of ISO which are approved by SERVICERS.

Bank will forward to ISO all information routinely provided by each Bank Card association that is not otherwise available to ISO that are allowed to be shared with ISO under the Rules that would be helpful to ISO in fulfilling its obligations under this Agreement.

  (d)   Bank will maintain all cardholder information under its control and/or possession in a safe and secure manner in compliance with the Rules, and will report to Bank Card associations as required by the Rules relating to internal policies and procedures related to cardholder information security. Furthermore, Bank agrees to inform the ISO immediately regarding any breach of information security that may have an adverse effect to the ISO or to its Merchants.

  (e)   Bank, as the acquiring principal member, agrees to represent ISO's interest in disputes that might arise from time to time with a Bank Card association over compliance with Rules and fines; provided, however, that ISO shall pay any fines or other charges imposed on Bank by a Bank Card association relating to the Merchant Program and any and all costs reasonably incurred by Bank in disputing the same, including reasonable associated legal fees.

Page 11







    prospective Merchant that falls within the risk and volume parameters set forth in this Section 4.2), provided that ISO performs the credit review in accordance with the Merchant Processing Policy, the terms of this Agreement and the Rules. In accordance with and as permitted by this Agreement, a third-party service provider approved by SERVICERS may perform site inspections for ISO. In order to assist ISO in its underwriting hereunder, SERVICERS shall assist ISO with checking Merchants and prospective Merchants against the Terminated Merchant File/MATCH List or any similar list maintained by any entity.

Page 12







  (c)   Terminate the Merchant Processing Agreement with respect to any Merchant at any time, according to the Merchant Processing Agreement terms.

Notwithstanding anything contained herein, so long as all of the following are true with respect to a Merchant or Merchant Account, SERVICERS agree that, except as required by the Rules, SERVICERS shall neither terminate nor make any change with respect to the discount or reserve of said Merchant or Merchant Account that will have an adverse effect on the Merchant or Merchant Account without the prior written consent of ISO:

Page 13







    compliance with the Rules or in violation of the Merchant Processing Agreement, ISO will instruct SERVICERS to change the Merchant bank account information to cause funds otherwise due such Merchant to be diverted and deposited into the Merchant Reserve Account for such Merchant. ISO will thereafter promptly investigate each such suspicious incident and, upon request, promptly notify SERVICERS of the result of any such investigation. If in any case ISO's investigation determines that no violation occurred, ISO will promptly request SERVICERS to release any funds diverted to the Merchant Reserve Account to the Merchant's deposit account. Once monies or other collateral are deposited in a Merchant Reserve Account, SERVICERS shall control the disbursements of such funds which are to be (a) paid to ISO or SERVICERS to cover losses incurred in connection with the applicable Approved Merchant or (b) returned to the applicable Approved Merchant upon a reduction in the potential risk to ISO and SERVICERS arising from the provision of services to such Merchant within two (2) Business Days after receipt of a written request by ISO. From time to time, ISO may request SERVICERS to disburse monies held in a Merchant Reserve Account to ISO or an Approved Merchant as set forth in the preceding sentence, and SERVICERS shall consider such requests in good faith.

Merchant Account settlement is included in the fees set forth in Exhibit A and will not incur an additional fee.

  (b)   On each Payment Date, SERVICERS shall credit ISO's Residual Account in an amount equal to all Net Program Participation Fees collected by SERVICERS since the immediately preceding Payment Date and which have not otherwise been paid to ISO.

  (c)   In the event that the Net Program Participation Fees are insufficient to pay any amounts due to SERVICERS' under this Agreement (including compensation, funding the Offset Account, funding the Reserve Account, or paying third party processing fees), then ISO shall provide sufficient additional funds to SERVICERS upon demand.

6.8  Assignment of Merchant Losses. SERVICERS agree that after SERVICERS have been fully reimbursed by ISO for a Merchant loss pursuant to this Agreement, and provided that the Merchant Account resulting in the Merchant loss has been terminated, that SERVICERS will, at the request of ISO, assign to ISO any and all of SERVICERS' subrogation rights under or related to the Merchant Processing Agreement (including guarantees, security or otherwise) related to the indebtedness of such Merchant under the Merchant Processing Agreement (including guarantees, security or otherwise), so that ISO may pursue collection recovery activities in connection with such Merchant loss. Any such collection recovery activities shall be conducted in the name of ISO and shall be subject to the indemnification obligations of ISO.

  (c)   If ISO's funds in the Reserve Account are not sufficient to cover the chargebacks, adjustments, fees and other charges due to SERVICERS from ISO or Merchants, or if the funds in the Reserve Account have been released, ISO agrees to pay SERVICERS such sums within five (5) Business Days of any such request by SERVICERS. In the event of a failure by ISO to fund the Reserve Account, SERVICERS may fund such Reserve Account in any of the manners set forth above.

  (d)   To secure ISO's obligations to SERVICERS under this Agreement, ISO grants to SERVICERS a lien and security interest in and to any of ISO's funds in the Reserve Account or otherwise related to this Agreement now or hereafter in the possession of SERVICERS, whether now or hereafter due or to become due to ISO from SERVICERS. ISO agrees to duly execute and deliver to SERVICERS such instruments and documents as SERVICERS may reasonably request to perfect and confirm the lien, security interest, right of setoff, recoupment and subordination set forth in this Agreement.

8.2  Inspection.ISO will, at any and all reasonable times, permit SERVICERS' employees, agents, attorneys, auditors, or bank regulators to inspect ISO's place of business to audit its operations for compliance with all Rules, laws, regulations, and directives of any governmental regulatory agency or Bank Card association, all at SERVICERS' expense.

8.3  Cooperation.SERVICERS and ISO will each timely furnish to the other any and all information and materials that the other may, from time to time, reasonably request in connection with all matters contemplated by this Agreement. Each party also shall take the action as the other may, from time to time, reasonably request in order that the purposes of this Agreement will be fully accomplished and that all matters contemplated hereby will comply with all Rules or other applicable statutory, regulatory or other legal requirements. ISO shall promptly deliver to SERVICERS after receipt by ISO a copy of all non-routine notices or correspondence that it receives from MasterCard, Visa, or other networks or Bank Card associations, or any other third party, which in any way relates to any Merchant's or ISO's participation in MasterCard, Visa, and other networks or Bank Card associations under this Agreement.

8.4  Compliance With Rules. ISO also covenants to the following:

  (e)   ISO acknowledges and agrees that Visa and/or MasterCard shall have the right, either in law or in equity, to enforce any provision of the Rules and to prohibit ISO's conduct that creates a risk of injury to Visa and/or MasterCard or that may adversely affect the integrity of Visa's and/or MasterCard's systems, information or both. ISO agrees to refrain from taking any action that would have the effect of interfering with or preventing an exercise of these rights by Visa and/or MasterCard.

  (f)   ISO agrees not to use any marks of Visa and/or MasterCard on its own behalf in the furtherance of the Program. ISO also agrees not to suggest, imply or in any manner create an impression that it is a Member or an authorized representative of Visa and/or MasterCard or that it is other than an independent sales organization or member service provider for a Member. Further, ISO may not create an impression that Visa and/or MasterCard in any way endorses ISO or the Program it coordinates through SERVICERS.

  (g)   ISO may use one or more of Visa's or MasterCard's marks under the following conditions:

  (i)   The marks are used in accordance with the Rules; and

  (ii)   The marks are used pursuant to the express written permission of Bank.

Page 20







      (including credit and criminal background checks) on all employees, Other MSP's and IC's.

  (i)   ISO further agrees to the following:

  (i)   ISO will not use Visa's and/or MasterCard's equipment and software ("V/MC Systems") and Visa and/or MasterCard information identified or reasonably understood to be confidential or proprietary ("V/MC Confidential Information") for anything other than to perform its duties on behalf of SERVICERS and definitely not for its own use or for any other purpose;

  (ii)   To treat the V/MC Systems and V/MC Confidential Information in at least as careful and confidential a manner as ISO treats its own or the SERVICERS' systems and confidential or proprietary information;

  (iii)   To acknowledge that access to the V/MC Systems and V/MC Confidential Information does not convey to ISO any right, title, interest or copyright therein or any license to use, sell, exploit, copy or develop them further;

  (iv)   To limit access to the V/MC Systems and V/MC Confidential Information to only those ISO employees and Other MSP's with a need to have access for the ISO to perform services under the Program and to implement and maintain reasonable and appropriate safeguards to prevent unauthorized access to or use of the V/MC Systems or V/MC Confidential Information;

  (v)   Solely with respect to the Program and this Agreement, upon request by SERVICERS, or, absent such requests, upon termination of ISO's performance under the Program, to immediately cease any and all use of V/MC Systems and promptly thereafter deliver to SERVICERS all V/MC Confidential Information then in the possession or control of ISO or, upon request by Visa and/or MasterCard, to immediately cease any and all use of the V/MC Systems and promptly thereafter deliver all V/MC Confidential Information that was provided by SERVICERS then in its possession or control to Visa and/or MasterCard; and

  (vi)   To immediately advise both SERVICERS and Visa and/or MasterCard if any unauthorized person or external entity seeks access to the V/MC Systems or V/MC Confidential Information whether by legal proceeding or otherwise.

  (j)   Visa and/or MasterCard may at any time conduct financial and procedural audits of ISO. ISO agrees to cooperate with and promptly supply Visa and/or MasterCard with all information and material requested.

Page 21







  (k)   ISO understands that all Program Materials including Merchant Applications, Merchant Processing Agreements, Merchant statements, and Promotional Materials (i) must be approved by SERVICERS before use, such approval not to unreasonably withheld or delayed beyond [***] [***] days, and (ii) may not state or imply that ISO is participating in or conducting any activity precluded by the Rules.

  (l)   ISO recognizes that SERVICERS must approve (in advance) any fee associated with the Program which must be clearly and conspicuously disclosed in writing to the Merchant prior to any payment or Application.

8.5   Registration as ISO. ISO and each Other MSP shall at all times, at ISO's and/or each Other MSP's cost and expense, maintain in effect during the term of this Agreement, a valid and effective registration as an independent service organization with Visa and a member service provider with MasterCard and shall provide any information as Visa and MasterCard may reasonably request in connection therewith or in connection with the services of ISO hereunder, and shall provide SERVICERS the information as it may reasonably request concerning compliance with all applicable Rules, laws, regulations and the requirements set forth herein in connection with this Agreement. The parties hereto will work together expeditiously and in good faith to register and maintain the registration of ISO and each Other MSP with the appropriate Bank Card associations as required under the Rules.

8.6   Mark Restriction. ISO shall not make any use of SERVICERS' Marks or any other Intellectual Property without SERVICERS' prior written consent, which will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed beyond [***] [***] days.

8.7   Financial Statements/Audit Rights. ISO shall make available (whether through public filings or directly) SERVICERS with annual audited financial statements prepared by an independent auditing firm within 90 days of the end of each fiscal year (and shall make available to SERVICERS quarterly financial statements upon request of SERVICERS). In addition, ISO will provide any shareholder/owner personal financial information as required by the Rules. ISO will, at any and all reasonable times, permit SERVICERS' employees, agents and/or auditors to inspect ISO's books and records at SERVICERS' expense prior request and notice and if for a particular need.

SECTION 9 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION

9.1   Confidential Information. Confidential Information is non-public and proprietary information relating to the business of ISO or its Affiliates that SERVICERS and their Affiliates acquire during the term of this Agreement, and information relating to the business of SERVICERS and their Affiliates. It includes, but is not limited to, the following, whether used in, or to be used in, the business of ISO or SERVICERS: physical systems for the operation of the business; all present and planned strategies, business plans, and projections; all market and sales and marketing information; all



*** Omitted pursuant to a confidential treatment request. The confidential portion has been filed separately with the SEC.

Page 22







    financial, accounting, and credit information; and the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Neither party will disclose, furnish, sell, convey, or use for any purpose other than as contemplated under this Agreement any of the other parties' Confidential Information or materials without written authorization. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties acknowledge and agree that all Merchant information is the Confidential Information of ISO and (i) may not be used by SERVICERS for any purpose other than to provide the services contemplated hereunder during the term of this Agreement and thereafter, and (ii) will not be used by SERVICERS, directly or indirectly, to solicit any Merchants in the Merchant Portfolio.

9.2   Exclusions. Nothing in this Section 9 shall restrict either party with respect to Confidential Information which: (a) the receiving party can demonstrate was rightfully possessed by it before it received the information from the disclosing party; (b) was in the public domain prior to the date of this Agreement or subsequently becomes publicly available through no fault of the receiving party or any person acting on its behalf; (c) was previously received by the receiving party from a third party or is subsequently furnished rightfully to the receiving party by a third party not known to be under restrictions on use or disclosure; (d) is independently developed by such party; (e) is required to be disclosed by the Rules, law, regulation or court order, provided that the disclosing party will exercise reasonable efforts to notify the other party prior to disclosure; or (f) is required to be disclosed to comply with or to enforce the terms of this Agreement.

9.3   Ownership of Work Product. Each party shall have and retain all ownership rights (including ownership of any Marks) in the work product developed for the implementation of the Program, including the Application, Merchant Processing Agreement and Promotional Materials that it creates, prepares or produces in connection with this Agreement, and all the work products shall remain the exclusive property of that party. Upon termination of the Agreement, each party shall immediately cease using any materials using the other's Marks or Intellectual Property, and shall immediately destroy all such materials.

9.4   Remedy; Survival. If any party breaches this Section 9, the non-breaching party will suffer irreparable harm and the total amount of monetary damages for any injury to such party will be impossible to calculate and therefore an inadequate remedy. Accordingly, the non-breaching party may (i) seek temporary and permanent injunctive relief against the breaching party or (ii) exercise any other rights and seek any other remedies to which the non-breaching party may be entitled to at law, in equity and under this Agreement for any violation of this Section 9. The provisions of this Section 9 shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement.

SECTION 10 TERM AND TERMINATION

10.1  Initial Term. The initial term of this Agreement shall be four (4) Processing Years commencing on the Effective Date of this Agreement and ending on June 30, 2010 unless

  (c)   Upon any commission of any fraudulent activity by ISO, or the illegal activity of ISO's employees in the performance of their duties in connection with this Agreement;

  (d)   Upon any failure by ISO to pay (or make arrangements to pay that are acceptable to SERVICERS) any amount due under this Agreement to SERVICERS which does not give rise to the right to terminate under any other provision of this Agreement within ten (10) Business Days after written notice to ISO of its failure to pay the amount;

  (a)   Upon the expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason, at the direction of ISO and pursuant to the plan of Deconversion, SERVICERS will transfer and assign all their interest in the Merchant Portfolio (including Merchant Processing Agreements and Merchant Accounts) and the dedicated BINs/ICAs to a Visa and MasterCard Member designated by ISO, provided first that: (a) all amounts due (or estimated to become due) in connection with each Merchant Processing Agreement and under this Agreement have been paid to SERVICERS; (b) the Termination Reserve Account has been adequately funded; (c) ISO provides full written indemnities to SERVICERS regarding actual and potential losses or other obligations arising out of operation of the Program or arising out of, or related to, this Agreement or any Merchant Processing Agreement; and (d) the Program Transfer complies with all applicable Rules, laws and regulations (the "Program Transfer"). [***]

  (b)   Until the completion of the Deconversion of the Merchant Portfolio, the parties shall continue to operate under the terms and conditions of this Agreement; provided, however, that upon the effective date of expiration or termination of this Agreement, ISO will promptly discontinue its promotion and recommendation of the Program and will cease to board new accounts on Bank's BINs and ICAs or for sponsorship by Bank. ISO will reimburse SERVICERS for any Deconversion pursuant to the plan for Deconversion, regardless of whether such Deconversion occurs before or after the expiration or termination of this Agreement. ISO shall continue to hold all risks associated with transactions processed by SERVICERS prior to the effective date of Deconversion of each respective Merchant in the Merchant Portfolio, including all risk relating to chargebacks and fraudulent transactions. ISO shall pay SERVICERS any amounts associated with such risks immediately upon demand.

10.5  Termination Reserve Account. Within ten (10) Business Days of the issuing of a notice of termination by any party, ISO shall fund a Termination Reserve Account.

The amount of the Termination Reserve Account shall be the greater of (i) the most recent required amount for the Reserve Account prior to termination, or (ii) the amount calculated as follows:

  (c)   The estimated maximum amount of any known or likely significant loss events (defined as a credit or fraud loss that is likely to exceed $[***]).

    Upon termination, any balance in the Reserve Account shall be transferred to, and be applied toward, the Termination Reserve Account. The Termination Reserve Account will be held by SERVICERS until the completion of the Program Transfer or for such longer period of time as is consistent with SERVICERS' liability for Bank Card transactions in accordance with the Rules. SERVICERS will reduce the Termination Reserve Account balance to reflect any reductions in ISO's then-potential liability as the Program Transfer and Deconversion progress. [***]

EXHIBIT G ADDITIONAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR POS NETWORKS MERCHANT SPONSORSHIP

1.  General.

  1.1.   ISO desires to deploy and service (or cause to be deployed and serviced), at merchant locations, terminals ("POS Terminals") that will be connected to the shared electronic funds transfer networks set forth on Schedule A to this Exhibit G, as it may be amended from time to time by FDMS in its sole discretion (the "Debit Networks"), to transmit point of sale transactions ("POS Transactions") generated by these POS Terminals through the Debit Networks' telecommunications and processing systems which effectuate the switching, processing and settlement of transactions ("Debit Network Systems"). (The services described in this paragraph shall be referred to in this Exhibit G as the "POS Services.").

  1.2.   ISO may offer qualified merchants the ability to provide, or have Customer provide on such merchant's behalf, merchants' ISOs with the option to pay their bills by initiating funds transfers through Debit Network Systems without PIN entry or verification, subject to additional terms and conditions agreed to by the ISO and FDMS ("PIN-less Debit"). (The services described in this paragraph shall be referred to in this Exhibit G as the "PIN-less Debit Services." The POS Services and PIN-less Debit Services, collectively, will be referred to in this Exhibit G as the "Debit Services").

  1.3.   Debit Networks require that in order for ISO to provide the POS Services to merchants, merchants must be sponsored into the Debit Network by a member of such Debit Network ("Network Member"). Certain Networks ("Standard Networks") require that in order for ISO to provide the PIN-less Debit Services to merchants, merchants must be sponsored into the Debit Network by a Network Member.

2.  Duties of FDMS. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, FDMS agrees to cause FFB, a Network Member, to: (a) sponsor Merchants into Debit Networks for provision of POS Services; (b) sponsor Merchants into Standard Networks for provision of PIN-less Debit Services through Standard Networks, subject to additional terms agreed upon by FDMS and ISO; provided, that FFB, in its absolute discretion, may refuse to sponsor any Merchant and may terminate its sponsorship of a Merchant or direct ISO to refuse to provide or terminate its provision of Debit Services to a Merchant.

  2.1.   Neither SERVICERS nor FFB will be responsible for the acts or omissions of any Debit Network or its agents or representatives.

3.  Conflict with Agreement.
