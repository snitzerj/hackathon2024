Dear Mr Saunders

Proposed Escrow Agreement: Healthgate Data Corp / Blackwell Science Ltd / NCC

I confirm that NCC is willing to enter into our standard form escrow agreement std001y2k.uk with the following amendments by reference to the appropriate clauses:

(2)   Add the words "and/or companies in the Blackwell Science Ltd group" after       "Blackwell Science Ltd".

6.1.6 A new clause: "there is a Change in Control of the Owner. For the purposes       of this clause, a person shall have "Control" of a company if he holds,       directly or indirectly, shares which together with shares held by any       persons acting in concert with him carry 50% or more of the voting rights       of that company, and "Change in Control" shall be interpreted accordingly.       Words and phrases in the City Code on Take-overs and Mergers shall have       the same meaning here."

6.1.7 A new clause: "the Licensee exercises its option under clause 10.4.1 of       the Licence Agreement".

11.4  Replace with: "If the obligations in clause 31 of the Licence Agreement       have terminated this Agreement will automatically terminate on the same       date."

Yours sincerely

                  6.1.5.3  the Owner has undertaken or attempted to procure the                            Package to be so capable and the Licensee                            demonstrates that the Package is still not so                            capable;

                  6.1.5.4  no such warranty, representation, undertaking or                            attempt has been given or made and the Licensee                            demonstrates that the Package is not so capable.

11    Termination

      11.1  NCC may terminate this Agreement after failure by the Owner or the             Licensee to comply with a 30 day written notice from NCC to pay any             outstanding fee. If the failure to pay is on the part of the Owner             the Licensee shall be given the option of paying such fee itself.             Such amount will be recoverable by the Licensee direct from the             Owner.

      11.3  If a new custodian is not appointed within 30 days of delivery of             any notice issued by NCC in accordance with the provisions of Clause             11.2, the Owner or the Licensee shall be entitled to request the             President for the time being of the British Computer Society to             appoint a suitable new custodian upon such terms and conditions as             he shall require. Such appointment shall be final and binding on all             parties.
