"Bandwidth" means the measurement of samples of usage taken every five (5) minutes during a calendar month and collecting two (2) readings (cumulative of inbound feeds and cumulative of outbound feeds at the same measured point in time). The measurements are stored and become data points. At the end of the month, all data points taken during the month are ranked in ascending order. IBM will discard the top five percent (5%) for each set (inbound and outbound) of data points. The highest remaining sample of the two (2) sets becomes the Customer's Committed or Burstable usage number for that billing cycle. "Burstable Bandwidth" means the bandwidth consumption in excess of the Committed Bandwidth. "Committed Bandwidth" means the fixed circuit capacity that IBM will make available to Customer for connectivity to the Internet. Customer's data traffic between the e-business Hosting Center and the Internet may not exceed Committed Bandwidth, unless otherwise expressly specified in an Attachment. "Content" means information, software, and data that Customer provides, including, without limitation, any hypertext markup language files, scripts, programs, recordings, sound, music, graphics, images, applets or servlets that Customer or its Subcontractors or Services Recipients create, install, upload or transfer in or through the e-business Hosting Environment and/or Customer Components.

"Customer" means IBM's Customer to whom the Services are being provided. "Customer Components" means the hardware, software and other products, data and Content that Customer provides, including those specified in Attachment B. "Customer Initiated Changes" means patches or changes to the environment dictated to be installed by Customer, and installed by either Customer or by IBM. "Customer Production Ready Date" or "CPRD" means the date (following the Hosting Service Ready Date) that the following items have been completed: (1) Customer has notified IBM that Customer has completed application testing and loading of Customer Content, and (2) IBM has notified Customer that monitoring and reporting have been enabled and end users may now begin using the Services. Commencing on the Customer Production Ready Date, Customer will not have administrative access for fully managed devices, unless specifically requested for a limited period of time mutually agreed between the parties, using the established change management procedures.

Other Disclaimers IBM does not warrant uninterrupted or error-free operation of any Service or that IBM will correct all defects. IBM does not make any representation or warranty with respect to Customer's responsibilities set forth in Section 11.6. IBM provides Materials, non-IBM products, and non-IBM services  WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND.  However, non-IBM manufacturers, suppliers, or publishers may provide their own warranties to you. IBM does not operate as a provider of services regulated by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) or state regulatory authorities (State Regulators), and does not intend to provide any services which are regulated by the FCC or State Regulators. If the FCC or any State Regulator imposes regulatory requirements or obligations on any Services provided by IBM hereunder, IBM may change the way in which such Services are provided to Customer to avoid the application of such requirements or obligations to IBM (e.g., by acting as Customer's agent for acquiring such Services from a third party common carrier). 7.0 Confidentiality All information exchanged between the parties is non-confidential.  If either or both parties require the exchange of confidential information, such information will be exchanged under the terms and conditions of a separate written confidentiality agreement.

If such a claim is made or appears likely to be made, Customer agrees to permit IBM to enable Customer to continue to use the Materials or Base Components, or to modify them, or replace them with non-infringing Materials or Base Components that are at least functionally equivalent. If IBM determines that none of these alternatives is reasonably available, Customer agrees to return the Materials or Base Components (if in Customer's possession) to IBM on IBM's written request.  IBM will give Customer a credit equal to the amount Customer paid IBM for the applicable Materials or for use of the applicable Base Components up to a maximum of twelve (12) months of applicable charges. This is IBM's entire obligation to Customer with regard to any claim of infringement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, IBM is not responsible for third party claims based on: anything Customer provides which is incorporated into the Materials; Customer's modification of the Materials; the combination, operation, or use of the Materials with any product, data, or apparatus that IBM did not provide; or non-IBM hardware, software, or data, including those that may be in the Base Components. Indemnification by Customer Customer will defend IBM and its Affiliates and their employees, officers, and directors, at Customer's expense, and pay all costs, damages, and reasonable attorneys' fees that a court finally awards (or which Customer agrees in any final settlement) for any third party claim: that Content or Customer's use of the Services violates a Customer's obligation in Sections 11.3(b) or 11.5 (b); that Customer Components infringe that party's patent or copyright; that is brought by a Services Recipient and is related, directly or indirectly, to the Services; or

arising out of or related to a mechanics' lien Customer is required to cancel and discharge pursuant to this Agreement. For indemnification under this Section 8.2, IBM will: promptly notify Customer in writing of the claim; and allow Customer to control, and will cooperate with Customer in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. 9.0 Limitation of IBM's Liability Circumstances may arise where, because of a default on IBM's part or other liability, Customer is entitled to recover damages from IBM. Regardless of the basis on which Customer is entitled to claim damages from IBM (including fundamental breach, negligence, misrepresentation, or other contract or tort claim), IBM is liable for no more than: indemnification payments as provided in Section 8.1; damages for bodily injury (including death) and damage to real property and tangible personal property; and the amount of any other actual direct damages, up to the greater of $100,000 or the charges paid by Customer to IBM for the Services in the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the accrual of the first claim related to the Services. The foregoing limit also applies to any of IBM's Affiliates and Subcontractors.  It is the cumulative maximum for which IBM and its Affiliates and Subcontractors are collectively responsible. Under no circumstances is IBM, its Affiliates or its Subcontractors liable for any of the following: third party claims against Customer for damages (other than those expressly provided in Subsections 9.0(a) and 9.0(b)); or loss of, or damage to, Customer's or any other entity's records or data. 10.0 Disclaimer of Consequential Damages In no event will either party be liable to the other for special, incidental, or indirect damages or for any consequential damages (including lost profits or savings), even if they are informed of the possibility; provided that this Section 10.0 does not apply to Customer's failure to pay any amounts owing to IBM under this Agreement (including amounts owing for Services that would have been rendered but for Customer's breach of this Agreement).  11.0 Other Customer Obligations Customer Contact Customer will designate an individual to whom all of IBM's communications will be addressed and who has the authority to act and make decisions for Customer in all aspects of the Services, including requesting changes, problem resolution, Service requests, assignment of Customer focal points with authority over specific Services, and designation of Customer Authorized Representatives ("Customer Contact"). Services Support Customer will comply with its responsibilities to support the Services as specified in applicable Attachments. Such obligations are to be performed at no charge to IBM. IBM's obligations are contingent on Customer meeting such support obligations. Representations and Warranties Customer represents and warrants that: it has the requisite corporate power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement; Customer has no contractual or other obligation that (i) restricts or prohibits Customer's execution or performance of this Agreement, or (ii) Customer will breach in connection with the execution or performance of this Agreement; and its use of the Services and all Content will comply with the Acceptable Use Policy.

No Sale or Lease of Goods As between Customer and IBM, IBM retains all right, title and interest in the Base Components. No goods are sold or leased by IBM under this Agreement. If Customer desires to purchase or lease goods from IBM, such purchase or lease will be governed by a separate mutually acceptable written agreement between Customer and IBM or an IBM Affiliate. No Lease of Real Property This Agreement is a services agreement and not a lease of any real property. 13.0 Changes Service Description IBM, in its reasonable discretion, may change the terms and conditions of Attachment A upon at least ninety (90) days prior notice to Customer if such change was the result of: law, regulation, or similar governmental action; a ruling by a court of competent jurisdiction; or changes in the method of service delivery that affect similar IBM e-business hosting customers. Changes as a result of a, b, or c above will be effective on the date IBM specifies in the notice. Acceptable Use Policy IBM, in its reasonable discretion, may modify the Acceptable Use Policy upon thirty (30) days' prior notice to Customer.  If such modification has a material adverse effect on the Customer's use of the Services and provided such modification is not required by law, regulation, or similar governmental action, or a ruling by a court of competent jurisdiction, Customer's sole remedy is to terminate this Agreement without the payment of termination charges provided Customer gives IBM notice of its intent to terminate within ninety (90) days of the effective date of such modification. Project Change Control Procedure This Agreement may be amended only by a writing signed by authorized representatives of both parties. Requests for such amendment ("Project Change Request" or "PCR") should be submitted in writing by the requesting party. The PCR should reference this Agreement, describe in a reasonable level of detail the proposed change, the rationale for the change, and the impact the proposed change may have on the Agreement. The parties will review the PCR and will do one of the following: authorize the change by signing the PCR; agree in writing to submit the PCR for further investigation. In such case, Customer agrees to pay IBM for its reasonable charges, if any, for such investigation. The investigation will determine the technical merits and the effect on the charges, schedule, and other terms and conditions that may result from the implementation of the PCR. The parties will then decide either to accept or to reject the PCR; or reject the PCR. If the PCR is rejected, the rejecting party will inform the requesting party of the reason for the rejection. A mutually signed PCR will be deemed an amendment to this Agreement. Any modification of this Agreement requested by Customer as a result of laws applicable to Customer will be considered a PCR covered by this Subsection. Until a change is agreed in writing, both parties will continue to act in accordance with the latest agreed version of the Agreement. 14.0 General Headings The headings of the various sections of this Agreement have been inserted for convenience only and shall not affect the interpretation of this Agreement. Survival Any of these terms and conditions which by their nature extend beyond the Agreement termination or expiration remain in effect until fulfilled, including, without limitation, Sections 4.4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.3, 11.4, 11.7, 12.2, 12.3, and 14, and apply to both Customer's and IBM's respective successors and assignees.

During this technical due diligence period Customer and IBM technical teams will work together and determine more specific detail regarding configuration, networking, firewall, server, SAN, backup and monitoring installation, configuration and management details, settings, rules, and the schedules and thresholds to be monitored. Any changes as a result of the technical due diligence period will be handled as follows: Any delays in the procurement of equipment will be documented in the project plan by the IBM project manager and communicated to Customer in a timely manner. Any delays in the schedule will be documented in the project plan by the IBM project manager and communicated to Customer in a timely manner; and IBM and Customer will use the PCR process to make any changes to this Agreement as a result of this technical due diligence period. Changes may result in adjustments to pricing. Service Level Agreement IBM will provide an availability service level agreement ("Server Availability SLA") for Qualifying Servers based on the applicable SLA Target Percentage (as such terms are defined below). The first device in the path to the Qualifying Server must be an IBM Managed Device, and the Server Availability SLA applies up through and including the last IBM Managed Server. Definitions The following definitions apply to this Server Availability SLA: "Actual Available Minutes (AAM)" means the Total Available Minutes minus minutes of Qualified Outages. Availability Credit" means an amount equal to five percent (5%) of monthly recurring charges for Managed Hosting Services.  Such credits are available when the services provided for the affected devices are less than the Monthly Availability Percentage. "IBM Managed Device" means a Base Component located in an IBM e-business Hosting Center for which IBM is performing management responsibilities. For servers, only the servers identified as Fully Managed Servers in Exhibit A are considered an IBM Managed Device. "Monthly Availability Percentage" means the amount equal to the total number of minutes in the applicable month minus the Qualifying Outage Minutes for that month, divided by the total number of minutes in that month. "Monthly Recurring Charge" means the total of Customer's monthly recurring charges. "Outage" means the period (measured in whole minutes) from the time indicated in a trouble ticket (when the Outage was reported to IBM) to the Outage end time based upon the problem resolution (as reflected in the trouble ticket call record). For clustered devices, all of the devices in the cluster must not be available for use by Customer. "Qualifying Server" means the IBM Managed Server that has been selected by Customer and approved by IBM. "Qualifying Outage Minutes" means the aggregate of all Outages in a month, minus any Outages in that month resulting from any exclusion described in Section 8.6 below. "SLA Target Percentage" means the Service Levels defined in 8.2 (Service Levels). "Unqualified Outage(s)" means an Outage(s) that can be attributed to the listed availability exclusions as set forth in Section 8.6 (Exclusions).

Service Levels

Source: QUANTUM GROUP INC /FL, 8-K, 1/20/2009





Service Levels IBM will provide the following monthly availability Service Level Agreement ("SLA") for the Services provided by IBM: For Managed Devices and Managed Servers (including firewall(s) and switches) that are not clustered or configured in a high availability configuration, the SLA is a minimum of 99.7 percent. For Managed Devices and Managed Servers (including firewall(s) and switches) that are clustered or configured in a high availability configuration, the SLA is a minimum of 99.9 percent. For Managed Application Solution (including firewalls(s) and switches) that are clustered or configured in a high availability configuration, the SLA is a minimum of 98.0 percent. For Managed Application Solution (including firewalls(s) and switches) that is not clustered or configured in a high availability configuration, the SLA is a minimum of 99.5 percent. For Basic Monitoring Services the SLA is a minimum of 99.9 percent applicable only for the core infrastructure components (including power, cooling, Internet connectivity, firewalls, load balancers, SSL acceleration, Network Intrusion Detection, VLAN segments, switches, VPN connection at the Hosting Center, and all related connections). For Advanced Monitoring Services the SLA is a minimum of 99.9 percent applicable only for the core infrastructure components (including power, cooling, Internet connectivity, firewalls, load balancers, SSL acceleration, Network Intrusion Detection, VLAN segments, switches, VPN connection at the Hosting Center, and all related connections). Availability Credits If in any month during the term of Managed Hosting Services the Monthly Availability Percentage for a Qualifying Server is less than the SLA Target Percentage for that Qualifying Server, Customer shall be eligible to receive an Availability Credit, subject to Section 8.3(b), 8.4, 8.5, 8.6 and 8.7. If in any month during the term of Managed Hosting Services the Monthly Availability Percentage for Basic Monitoring or Advanced Monitoring Services is less than the SLA Target Percentage for Basic Monitoring or Advanced Monitoring Services, Customer shall be eligible to receive an Availability Credit, subject to Section 8.3(b), 8.4, 8.5, 8.6 and 8.7. Customer agrees to contact the IBM Help Desk to report problems and open trouble tickets that reflect the start time of the Outage event. Settlement of Credits Availability Credits will be aggregated on a quarterly basis and settled by the last day of the first month following the end of the quarter in which such Availability Credits were earned. (For example, the aggregate Availability Credits earned in the first quarter 2007 will be applied against Monthly Recurring Charge for Services the Customer incurs in the April 2007 invoice.) Any Availability Credits owed from IBM to Customer upon the expiration or termination of the Services will be paid within one (1) month following the effective date of expiration or termination. If the Monthly Recurring Charge for a subject month has not been incurred, or for any other reason has been credited or waived, Customer shall not be eligible for an Availability Credit for that month. Customer shall receive no more than five percent (5%) of Customer's Monthly Recurring Charge for Managed Hosting Services as an Availability Credit in a given month. Commencement of Service Level Agreement IBM will exercise commercially reasonable efforts to meet the SLA Target Percentage. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Customer shall not be eligible for an Availability Credit until the first full calendar month following the Hosting Service Ready Date. Exclusivity of Remedies Customer agrees that its sole remedy for IBM's failure to meet an SLA Target Percentage is the Availability Credit as provided in this Attachment. Exclusions IBM is not responsible for any Outage outside of its control, including but not limited to, the following examples: periods of scheduled or emergency maintenance activities or scheduled Outage; Outage due to problems with Customer provided Content or programming errors including, but not limited to, Content installation and integration;
