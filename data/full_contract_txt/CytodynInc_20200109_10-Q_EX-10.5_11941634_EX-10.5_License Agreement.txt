In the event that a Licensed Product is sold as a Combination Product, Net Sales shall be determined as follows:

(A) where all API(s) in such Combination Product are sold separately in the Territory, Net Sales shall be calculated by multiplying the Net Sales of the Combination Product by the fraction A/(A+B), where A is the weighted (by sales volume) average unit sale price of the Licensed Product, as sold separately in finished form in the Territory, where net sales is calculated in the same manner as Net Sales, and B is the sum of the weighted average unit sale price in the Territory (net sales being calculated in the same manner as Net Sales) of the other API(s) included in the Combination Product when sold separately in finished form at the same dosage levels, in each case during the applicable royalty reporting period, or, if sales of both the Licensed Product and the other API(s) did not occur in the same country in such period, then in the most recent royalty reporting period in which sales of both occurred, provided that such "recent royalty reporting period" shall not have been more than twenty-four (24) months earlier.

(B) In the event that such weighted average sale price of the Licensed Product component of the Combination Product cannot be determined, but the weighted average sale price of the other API(s) in the Combination Product can be determined, Net Sales shall be calculated by multiplying the Net Sales of the Combination Product by the fraction (C-D)/C, where C is the weighted (by sales volume) average unit sale price of the Combination Product, and D is the sum of the weighted (by sales volume) average unit sales prices charged for the other API(s) in the Combination Product when sold separately in finished form.

(C) In the event that such weighted average sale price of the other API(s) in the Combination Product cannot be determined, but the weighted average sale price of the Licensed Product component of the Combination Product can be determined, Net Sales shall be calculated by multiplying the Net Sales of the Combination Product by the fraction A/C, where A is the weighted (by sales volume) average unit sales price of such Licensed Product component as sold separately, and C is the weighted (by sales volume) average unit sales price of the Combination Product.

(D) In the event that neither the weighted average sale price of the Licensed Product nor the weighted average sales price of the other API(s) in the Combination Product can be determined, the Net Sales of the Licensed Product shall be calculated by multiplying the Net Sales of the Combination Product (determined as provided above for Licensed Products) by the fraction D/D+E where D is the fair market value of the portion of the Combination Product that includes the Licensed Product and E is the fair market value of the portion of the Combination Product containing the other API(s) in such Combination Product, and all such fair market values shall be determined in good faith by the Parties.

In the event either Party reasonably believes that the calculation set forth above does not fairly reflect the value of the Licensed Product, relative to the other API(s) in the Combination Product, the Parties shall negotiate, in good faith, other means of calculating Net Sales with respect to Combination Products to so reflect such value.

The weighted average sale price for a Licensed Product, any other API(s) used in a Combination Product, or any Combination Product shall be calculated once each Calendar Year, at the beginning of such Calendar Year, and such price shall be used during all applicable royalty reporting periods for such entire Calendar Year. When determining the weighted average sale price of a Licensed Product, other API(s), or Combination Product, the weighted average sale price shall be calculated by dividing the sales dollar (translated into U.S. dollars) by the units of active ingredient sold during the preceding Calendar Year (or the number of months sold in a partial Calendar Year) for the respective Licensed Product, other API(s), or Combination Product. In the initial Calendar Year, a forecasted weighted average sale price will be used for the Licensed Product, other API(s) or Combination Product.

All right, title and interest in and to any and all Inventions that would be necessary or useful to Develop, Manufacture or Commercialize a Licensed Product (and/or an improvement, modification or line extension thereof) will be owned by CytoDyn. To the fullest extent permitted by law, Vyera shall, and hereby does, assign all of its right title and interest in and to any and all Inventions to CytoDyn. In the event that such assignment would be unlawful, Vyera shall, and hereby does, grant to CytoDyn an exclusive, irrevocable, worldwide, sublicensable (including through multiple tiers), transferrable (without consent) royalty free license to any and all right, title and/or interest that it may have in or to an Invention. Vyera will, upon reasonable request of CytoDyn, and at CytoDyn's expense, execute or cause to be executed, any assignments, filings, applications or other documents that CytoDyn may require to evidence its rights in the Inventions.

2.4 Enforcement and Defense of Patents. (a) Each Party shall give the other Party notice, promptly after becoming aware, of any infringement of CytoDyn Patents, where such infringement concerns the Commercialization, manufacture, importation, use, offer for sale or sale of a Licensed Product in the Field in the Territory (a "Licensed Product Infringement"). CytoDyn shall have the sole right to initiate and prosecute any legal action at its sole expense in its name with respect to CytoDyn Patents, and to also control the defense of any declaratory judgment action relating to such Licensed Product Infringement; provided that no settlement, or consent judgment or other voluntary final disposition of the suit that relates to the Licensed Product in the Field in the Territory may be entered into without the consent of Vyera, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

Vyera shall not, itself or through other Persons, directly or indirectly, solicit, advertise, sell, distribute, ship, consign, or otherwise transfer any Licensed Product outside of the Field or outside of the Territory.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the JC and/or the Parties are not able to come to agreement on a program to pursue a [***], the decision on whether to pursue a [***] shall be made by CytoDyn in its sole discretion provided, however, that such [***] will not be eligible for a [***].

8.7 Required Licenses. If either Party receives a notice from a Third Party indicating that the Commercialization of a Licensed Product in the Field in the Territory infringes a Third Party Patent, it will promptly notify the other Party. The Parties will thereafter discuss a response in good faith. If the Parties agree in good faith that it is reasonable to enter into a license with such Third Party to avoid infringement of such Third Party patent(s)by the sale, offer for sale or use of a Licensed Product in the Field in the Territory (each such license, a "Required Third Party License"), then CytoDyn shall have the right to negotiate the terms of such Required Third Party License and the amounts payable under such Required Third Party License shall be deducted from the royalties payable to CytoDyn. If either of the Parties agree in good faith that it is not reasonable to enter into a license with a Third Party to avoid infringement by the sale, offer for sale or use of a Licensed Product in the Field in the Territory, any fees, costs or expenses incurred by either Party, including, without limitation, damages as a result of an infringement claim, will be borne by CytoDyn in accordance with Section 13.2. If the Parties agree in good faith that it is appropriate to bring an opposition, action for declaratory judgment, nullity action, interference, declaration for non-infringement, re- examination or other attack upon the validity, title or enforceability of a patent owned or controlled by a Third Party based on its' potential adverse impact on the patent freedom-to-operate with respect to the Commercialization of a Licensed Product in the Field in the Territory, then CytoDyn shall control such action and shall be responsible for the costs of such action. CytoDyn shall provide Vyera with copies of any substantive documents related to such proceedings and reasonable notice of all such proceedings. Vyera may itself or through its counsel offer comments and suggestions with respect to the matters that are the subject of this Section 8.7 and CytoDyn shall consider such comments and suggestions in good faith. If the Parties disagree in good faith as to whether it is reasonable to enter into a license agreement with a Third Party to avoid infringement by the sale, offer for sale or use of a Licensed Product in the Field in the Territory and such Third Party subsequently brings an infringement action (or an infringement action is brought on its behalf) that is solely related to the sale, offer for sale or use of a Licensed Product in the Field in the Territory, then the Party that did not agree to pursuing the Required Third Party License will be responsible for all costs, fees and damages incurred in connection with such infringement action in the event and to the extent any such infringement action is solely related to the sale, offer for sale or use of a Licensed Product in the Field in the Territory, and the provisions of Section 13.2 shall not apply if Vyera is the Party that did not agree to pursue such Required Third Party License solely for the sale, offer for sale or use of a Licensed Product in the Field in the Territory.

8.8 Royalty Report; Payment. Within forty-five (45) days following the end of each Calendar Quarter after the First Commercial Sale of each Licensed Product in the Territory, Vyera shall provide CytoDyn with a report in a form reasonably acceptable to CytoDyn containing the following information for the applicable Calendar Quarter for such Licensed Product: (a) the amount of gross sales of the Licensed Product in the Territory; (b) an itemized calculation of Net Sales in the Territory showing reasonably detailed deductions; provided for in the definition of "Net Sales"; (c) a reasonably detailed calculation of the royalty payment due on such sales; (d) an accounting of the number of units of the Licensed Product sold; and (e) the application of the reduction, if any, made in accordance with the terms of Section 8.7.

8.10 Taxes. The amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement ("Payments") shall not be reduced on account of any taxes unless required by Applicable Law. Vyera shall deduct and withhold from the Payments any taxes that it is required by Applicable Law to deduct or withhold. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if CytoDyn is entitled under any applicable tax treaty to a reduction of rate of, or the elimination of, or recovery of, applicable withholding tax, it may deliver to Vyera or the appropriate Governmental Authority the prescribed forms necessary to reduce the applicable rate of withholding or to relieve Vyera of its obligation to withhold tax. In such case Vyera shall apply the reduced rate of withholding, or not withhold, as the case may be, provided that Vyera is in receipt of evidence, in a form reasonably satisfactory to Vyera, for example CytoDyn's delivery of all required documentation at least five (5) Business Days prior to the time that the Payments are due. If, in accordance with the foregoing, Vyera withholds any amount, it shall pay to CytoDyn the balance when due, make timely payment to the proper taxing authority of the withheld amount, and send CytoDyn proof of such payment within thirty (30) days following that payment.

8.11 Audit. Vyera shall maintain, and shall cause its Affiliates to maintain, complete and accurate records in sufficient detail to permit CytoDyn to confirm the accuracy of the calculation of royalties and milestones due under this Agreement.

Any such auditor shall not disclose Vyera's Confidential Information, except to the extent such disclosure is necessary to verify the accuracy of the financial reports furnished by Vyera or the amount of payments due by Vyera under this Agreement. Any amounts shown to be owed but unpaid shall be paid within thirty (30) days from the accountant's report, plus interest, as set forth in Section 8.12 from the original due date. Any amounts shown to have been overpaid shall be refunded within thirty (30) days from the accountant's report. CytoDyn shall bear the full cost of such audit unless such audit discloses an underpayment by Vyera of more than five percent (5%) of the amount due, in which case Vyera shall bear the full cost of such audit. The audit rights set forth in this Section 8.11 shall survive the Term for a period of three (3) years.

8.12 Late Payment. All payments due to a Party under this Agreement shall be made in U.S. Dollars by wire transfer of immediately available funds into an account designated by the receiving Party. If a Party does not receive payment of any sum due to it on or before the due date, simple interest shall thereafter accrue on the sum due to such Party until the date of payment at the per annum rate of two percent (2%) over the then prime rate quoted by Citibank in New York City or the maximum rate allowable by Applicable Law, whichever is lower.

8.13 Equity Investment. Within seven (7) days of the Effective Date, Vyera shall make an equity investment of $4,000,000 in CytoDyn (the "Equity Investment"), pursuant to that certain Subscription Agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as Attachment E and that certain Warrant Agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as Attachment F.

If a case is commenced during the Term by or against a Party under the Bankruptcy Laws, this Agreement is rejected as provided for under the Bankruptcy Laws, and the non-bankrupt Party elects to retain its rights hereunder as provided for under the Bankruptcy Laws, then the Party subject to such case under the Bankruptcy Laws (in any capacity, including debtor-in-possession) and its successors and assigns (including a Title 11 trustee), shall continue to provide whatever rights held by and granted to the non-bankrupt Party with respect to and as licensee of the Patents and Know How licensed hereunder as such rights existed hereunder immediately before the commencement of the case under the Bankruptcy Laws.

(b) If a Party intends to begin an arbitration to resolve a dispute arising under this Agreement after the provisions of Section 12.2 have been exhausted, such Party shall provide written notice (the "Arbitration Request") to the other Party of such intention and the issues for resolution. From the date of the Arbitration Request and until such time as the dispute has become finally settled, the running of the time periods as to which a Party must cure a breach of this Agreement becomes suspended as to the subject matter of the dispute. Unless the Parties otherwise agree in writing, during the period of time that any arbitration proceeding is pending under this Agreement, the Parties shall continue to comply with all those terms and provisions of this Agreement that are not the subject of the pending arbitration proceeding. (c) Within ten (10) Business Days after the receipt of the Arbitration Request, the other Party may, by written notice, add additional issues for resolution; provided, that such issues have been subject to Section 12.2 and relate directly to the matter that is the subject of the applicable Arbitration Request. (d) The arbitration shall be conducted by one arbitrator selected in accordance with the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Large Complex Disputes as modified below, unless the matter in dispute has a value of at least $50,000,000 and either Party wishes to have the arbitration conducted by a panel of three (3) arbitrators. The arbitrator(s) shall be experienced in the subject matter of the Arbitration Request as it applies to the biotechnology or pharmaceutical business. The Parties shall cooperate to attempt to select the arbitrator(s) by agreement within twenty (20) days of the initiation of arbitration. If agreement cannot be reached within such twenty (20) days, then that AAA will submit a list of twenty (20) qualified arbitrators from which each Party shall strike unacceptable entries; provided that each Party shall not strike more than thirty-five percent (35%) of the names without cause, and rank the remaining names. The AAA shall appoint the arbitrator(s) with the highest combined ranking(s). If these procedures fail to result in selection of the required number of arbitrators, the AAA shall appoint the arbitrator(s), allowing each side challenges for cause. The arbitration shall be held in New York, New York and all proceedings and communications shall be conducted in English. The Parties shall each use their best efforts to have the arbitration hearing held as soon as practicable and in any event within sixty (60) days after the selection of the arbitrator(s).

The proposed ruling shall be limited to proposed rulings and remedies on each issue, and shall contain no argument on or analysis of the facts or issues. Within five (5) Business Days after close of the hearing, each Party may submit a post-hearing brief (up to five (5) pages) to the arbitrator(s). (e) Either Party may apply first to the arbitrator(s) for interim injunctive relief until the arbitration decision is rendered or the arbitration matter is otherwise resolved; provided, that if such Party determines that such injunctive relief cannot be awarded in a timeframe adequate to protect such Party's interests, then a Party may, without waiving any right or remedy under this Agreement, seek from any court having jurisdiction any injunctive or provisional relief necessary to protect the rights or property of that Party pending resolution of the arbitration matter pursuant to this Section 12.3. The arbitrators shall have no

authority to award punitive or any other type of damages not measured by a Party's compensatory damages. The Parties further agree that the decision of the arbitrators shall be the sole, exclusive and binding remedy between them regarding determination of arbitration matters presented. (f) The Parties hereby agree that any disputed performance or suspended performance pending the resolution of an arbitration matter that the arbitrators determine to be required to be performed by a Party must be completed within a reasonable time period following the final decision of the arbitrators. (g) Each Party shall bear its own attorneys' fees, costs, and disbursements arising out of the arbitration, and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the arbitrators; provided, however, that the arbitrators shall be authorized to determine whether a Party is the prevailing Party, and if so, to award to that prevailing Party reimbursement for its reasonable attorneys' fees, costs and disbursements (including, for example, expert witness fees and expenses, photocopy charges and travel expenses), and/or the fees and costs of the arbitrators. (h) Except to the extent necessary to confirm an award or decision or as may be required by Applicable Laws, neither a Party nor an arbitrator may disclose the existence, content, or results of an arbitration without the prior written consent of both Parties. (i) By agreeing to this binding arbitration provision, the Parties understand that they are waiving certain rights and protections which may otherwise be available if a dispute between the Parties were determined by litigation in court, including the right to seek or obtain certain types of damages precluded by this provision, the right to a jury trial, certain rights of appeal, and a right to invoke formal rules of procedure and evidence.

Reserved Disputes shall not include disputes with respect to the interpretation, breach, termination or invalidity of this Agreement. [***]

During the pendency of any Dispute resolution proceeding between the Parties under this Article 12, the obligation to make any payment under this Agreement from one Party to the other Party, which payment is the subject, in whole or in part, of a proceeding under this Article 12, shall be tolled until the final outcome of such Dispute has been established.

13.2 Indemnification by CytoDyn. CytoDyn hereby agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Vyera and its Affiliates and each of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives (each, a "Vyera Indemnitee") from and against any and all Losses to which any Vyera Indemnitee may become subject as a result of any Claim to the extent such Losses arise directly or indirectly out of: (a) the breach by CytoDyn of any warranty, representation, covenant or agreement made by CytoDyn in this Agreement; (b) the negligence, gross negligence, illegal conduct, or willful misconduct of CytoDyn or its Affiliate or its licensee (other than Vyera or its Affiliate), or any officer, director, employee, agent or representative thereof; or (c) subject to Section 8.7, the infringement of Third Party Patents or the misappropriation of Third Party Know-How by the sale, offer for sale or use of any Licensed Product in the Field in the Territory; except, with respect to each of subsections (a), (b) or (c) above, to the extent such Losses arise directly or indirectly from the negligence, gross negligence, illegal conduct or willful misconduct of any Vyera Indemnitee or the breach by Vyera of any warranty, representation, covenant or agreement made by Vyera in this Agreement.

13.3 Indemnification Procedures. (a) Notice. Promptly after a CytoDyn Indemnitee or a Vyera Indemnitee (each, an "Indemnitee") receives notice of a pending or threatened Claim, such Indemnitee shall give written notice of the Claim to the Party from whom the Indemnitee is entitled to receive indemnification pursuant to Sections 13.1 or 13.2, as applicable (the "Indemnifying Party"). However, an Indemnitee's delay in providing or failure to provide such notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations, except to the extent it can demonstrate actual prejudice due to the delay or lack of notice. (b) Defense. Upon receipt of notice under this Section 13.3 from the Indemnitee, the Indemnifying Party will have the duty to either compromise or defend, at its own expense and by counsel (reasonably satisfactory to Indemnitee) such Claim. The Indemnifying Party will promptly (and in any event not more than twenty (20) days after receipt of the Indemnitee's original notice) notify the Indemnitee in writing that it acknowledges its obligation to indemnify the Indemnitee with respect to the Claim pursuant to this Article 13 and of its intention either to compromise or defend such Claim. Once the Indemnifying Party gives such notice to the Indemnitee, the Indemnifying Party is not liable to the Indemnitee for the fees of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with such defense, other than the Indemnitee's reasonable out of pocket Third Party expenses related to its investigation and cooperation, except as otherwise provided in the next sentence. As to all Claims as to which the Indemnifying Party has assumed control under this Section 13.3(b), the Indemnitee shall have the right to employ separate counsel and to participate in the defense of a Claim (as reasonably directed by the Indemnifying Party) at its own expense; provided, however, that if the Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded, based upon a written opinion from outside legal counsel, that there is a conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnitee in the defense of such Claim, in which case the Indemnifying Party shall pay the fees and expenses of one (1) law firm serving as counsel for the Indemnitee in relation to such Third Party Claim. (c) Cooperation. The Indemnitee shall reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its legal representatives in the investigation and defense of any Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall keep the Indemnitee informed on a reasonable and timely basis as to the status of such Claim (to the extent the Indemnitee is not participating in the defense of such Claim) and conduct the defense of such Claim in a prudent manner. (d) Settlement. If an Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Claim, no compromise or settlement of such Claim may be effected by the Indemnifying Party without the Indemnitee's written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnitee's consent shall not be required of a settlement where: (i) there is no finding or admission of any violation of law or any violation of the rights of any person and no effect on any other claims that may be made against the Indemnitee; (ii) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party; (iii) the Indemnitee's rights under this Agreement are not adversely affected; and (iv) there is a full release of the Indemnitee from such Claim. If the Indemnifying Party fails to assume defense of a Claim within a reasonable time, the Indemnitee may settle such Claim on such terms as it deems appropriate with the consent of the Indemnifying Party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), and the Indemnifying Party shall be obligated to indemnify the Indemnitee for such settlement as provided in this Article 13. It is understood that only Vyera and CytoDyn may claim indemnification under this Agreement (on its own behalf or on behalf of its Indemnitees), and other Indemnitees may not directly claim indemnity under this Agreement.

13.4 Insurance. Each Party, at its own expense, shall maintain comprehensive general liability, product liability and other appropriate insurance for the activities such Party undertakes pursuant to this Agreement, from reputable and financially secure insurance carriers in a form and at levels consistent with sound business practice and adequate in light of its obligations under this Agreement. Each Party shall provide a certificate of insurance (or evidence of self-insurance) evidencing such coverage to the other Party upon request. Such insurance will not create a limit to a Party's liability with respect to its indemnification obligations under this Article 13 or otherwise. This Section 13.4 will survive expiration or termination of this Agreement for the period in which the Licensed Product is being Commercialized by or on behalf of Vyera plus six (6) years. Each Party shall provide the other Party with prompt written notice of any cancellation, non-renewal or material change in such insurance that could materially adversely affect the rights of the other Party hereunder, and shall provide such notice within thirty (30) days after any such cancellation, non-renewal or material change.

13.5 Limitation of Liability. EXCEPT FOR A PARTY'S OBLIGATIONS SET FORTH IN THIS ARTICLE 13, AND ANY BREACH OF ARTICLE 10 (CONFIDENTIALITY), IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY (OR THE OTHER PARTY'S AFFILIATES OR SUBLICENSEES) IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT FOR LOST REVENUE, LOST PROFITS, LOST ROYALTIES, LOST SAVINGS, LOSS OF USE, DAMAGE TO GOODWILL, OR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR INDIRECT DAMAGES IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, HOWEVER CAUSED, UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, INCLUDING CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, OR STRICT LIABILITY, EVEN IF THAT PARTY HAS BEEN PLACED ON NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. FOR CLARITY AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE PROVISIONS OF THE FIRST SENTENCE OF THIS SECTION 13.5, ROYALTIES AND MILESTONES PAYABLE TO CYTODYN IN CONNECTION WITH VYERA'S COMMERCIALIZATION OF LICENSED PRODUCTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT COULD CONSTITUTE DIRECT DAMAGES TO THE EXTENT AWARDED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE 12.

CytoDyn Inc. 1111 Main Street, Suite 660 Vancouver, WA 98660 Attention: Nader Pourhassan, CEO Email: [***]

Lowenstein Sandler LLP One Lowenstein Drive Roseland, NJ 07068 Attention: [***] Email: [***]

14.2 Governing Law. This Agreement and all disputes arising out of or related to this Agreement or any breach hereof shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to any choice of law principles that would result in the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement

14.3 Designation of Affiliates. Each Party may discharge any obligation and exercise any right hereunder through delegation of its obligations or rights to any of its Affiliates. Each Party hereby guarantees the performance by its Affiliates of such Party's obligations under this Agreement, and shall cause its Affiliates to comply with the provisions of this Agreement in connection with such performance. Any breach by a Party's Affiliate of any of such Party's obligations under this Agreement shall be deemed a breach by such Party, and the other Party may proceed directly against such Party without any obligation to first proceed against such Party's Affiliate.

14.4 Relationship of the Parties. It is expressly agreed that CytoDyn, on the one hand, and Vyera, on the other hand, shall be independent contractors and that the relationship between the two Parties shall not constitute a partnership, joint venture or agency, including for tax purposes. Neither CytoDyn nor Vyera shall have the authority to make any statements, representations or commitments of any kind, or to take any action which shall be binding on the other, without the prior written consent of the other Party to do so. All persons employed by a Party shall be employees of that Party and not of the other Party and all costs and obligations incurred by reason of such employment shall be at the expense of such Party.

14.5 Force Majeure. Both Parties shall be excused from the performance of their obligations under this Agreement to the extent that such performance is prevented by Force Majeure and the nonperforming Party promptly provides notice of the prevention to the other Party. Such excuse shall be continued so long as the condition constituting Force Majeure continues and the nonperforming Party takes reasonable efforts to remove the condition. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Party shall not be excused from making payments owed hereunder because of a Force Majeure affecting such Party. If a Force Majeure persists for more than [***], then the Parties shall discuss in good faith the modification of the Parties' obligations under this Agreement in order to mitigate the delays caused by such Force Majeure.

14.6 Assignment. Vyera may not assign this Agreement, or any rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of CytoDyn, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed provided that Vyera may assign this Agreement without CytoDyn's consent to an Affiliate or to a successor to substantially all of the business of Vyera to which this Agreement relates. A Change of Control shall be deemed an assignment for purposes of this Agreement. Any permitted successor or assignee of rights and/or obligations permitted hereunder shall, in writing to the other Party, expressly assume performance of such rights and/or obligations. Any permitted assignment shall be binding on the successors of the assigning Party. Any assignment or attempted assignment by Vyera in violation of the terms of this Section 14.6 shall be null, void and of no legal effect. For clarity, nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit Vyera from undergoing any Change of Control, but if Vyera undergoes a Change of Control, it will be subject to Section 2.6. CytoDyn may assign this Agreement and its rights and obligations hereunder, in whole but not in part, to any Third Party not in a materially worse (financially and otherwise) of performing CytoDyn's obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of Vyera (it being understood that any other assignment of this Agreement or any rights or obligations hereunder shall require the prior written consent of Vyera, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

14.7 Severability. If any one (1) or more of the provisions of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction from which no appeal can be or is taken, the provision(s) shall be considered severed from this Agreement and shall not serve to invalidate any remaining provisions hereof. The Parties shall make a good faith effort to replace any invalid or unenforceable provision with a valid and enforceable provision such that the objectives contemplated by the Parties when entering this Agreement may be realized.

14.8 Waiver and Non-Exclusion of Remedies. Any term or condition of this Agreement may be waived at any time by the Party that is entitled to the benefit thereof, but no such waiver shall be effective unless set forth in a written instrument duly executed by or on behalf of the Party waiving such term or condition. The waiver by either Party hereto of any right hereunder or of the failure to perform or of a breach by the other Party shall not be deemed a waiver of any other right hereunder or of any other breach or failure by such other Party whether of a similar nature or otherwise. The rights and remedies provided herein are cumulative and do not exclude any other right or remedy provided by Applicable Law or otherwise available except as expressly set forth herein.

14.9 Further Assurance. Each Party shall duly execute and deliver, or cause to be duly executed and delivered, such further instruments and do and cause to be done such further acts and things, including the filing of such assignments, agreements, documents, and instruments, as may be necessary or as the other Party may reasonably request in connection with this Agreement or to carry out more effectively the provisions and purposes hereof.

14.10 Headings. The headings of each Article and Section in this Agreement have been inserted for convenience of reference only and are not intended to limit or expand on the meaning of the language contained in the particular Article or Section.

14.11 Construction. Except where the context otherwise requires, wherever used, the singular shall include the plural, the plural shall include the singular, and the use of any gender shall be applicable to all genders. Whenever this Agreement refers to a number of days without using a term otherwise defined herein, such number refers to calendar days. The terms "including," "include," "includes" or "for example" shall not limit the generality of any description preceding such term and, as used herein, shall have the same meaning as "including, but not limited to," and/or "including, without limitation." The language of this Agreement shall be deemed to be the language mutually chosen by the Parties and no rule of strict construction shall be applied against either Party hereto. Each Party represents that it has been represented by legal counsel in connection with this Agreement and acknowledges that it has participated in the drafting hereof. In interpreting and applying the terms and provisions of this Agreement, the Parties agree that no presumption will apply against the Party which drafted such terms and provision.
