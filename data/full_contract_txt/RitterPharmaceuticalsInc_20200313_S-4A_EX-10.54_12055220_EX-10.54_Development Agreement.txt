4. Price, Shipment and Payment 4.1. Price. The price that Sekisui shall pay for the Products shall be established separately for the Reagent Kits and for the products other than Reagent Kits. The price that Sekisui shall pay for the Reagent Kits Products shall be based upon a formula intended to ensure that Sekisui will receive 90% of the total Available Margin for all Products during the first 12 months of this Agreement, 70% of the total Available Margin for all Products during months 13-24 of this Agreement, and 65% of the total Available Margin for all Products thereafter. Accordingly, the prices (established separately for the Reagent Kits and for the products other than Reagent Kits) to be paid by Sekisui for the Products shall be fixed (subject to a later lookback true up) for each respective prospective six month period in the manner set forth in Exhibit D. The initial prices Sekisui agrees to pay for the respective Products for the first such prospective "six month period" (in this instance actually a five month period: May-September 2016) shall be fixed (subject to a later lookback true up) in the manner set forth in Exhibit D. Thereafter such prices shall be revisited and recalculated (prospectively) every six months in the manner set forth in Exhibit D (i.e., for purposes of such calculations for establishing the new prospective prices for the reagent products, the applicable Net Revenue, COGS and Available Margin shall be the Net Revenue, COGS and Available Margin for the applicable historical 6-month period as defined in Exhibit D). In addition, on a semi-annual basis, such amount shall be reviewed based on the actual Net Revenue, COGS and Available Margin for the 6 months then ended. In the event that such review results in a difference from the intended share of Available Margin between the Parties as contemplated above, the Parties shall make a true up payment between them in order to compensate for such overpayment or shortfall, all as provided in Exhibit D. Any true-up payments shall be paid by the applicable Party within 30 days of the receipt of an invoice for the agreed to true up amount. Sekisui shall set the customer selling prices in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner. 4.2. Shipment.

4.9. Taxes.

Qualigen shall provide Sekisui any tax forms that may be reasonably necessary in order for Sekisui to not withhold tax or to withhold tax at a reduced rate under an applicable bilateral income tax treaty.

Medical Device Tax. The party responsible for paying any applicable medical device excise tax pursuant to Section 4191 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code or any successor thereto will be as determined under such tax provisions. If any, such medical device excise tax will be treated as a cost element to be included in COGS as referenced in Exhibit A. 4.10. Interest.

Development Plan Intellectual Property Rights. Except as set forth in this Section, Qualigen shall own all right, title and interest in and to all Intellectual Property Rights (if any) resulting from Qualigen's activities under the Development Plan ("Development IP"), but excluding all Sekisui Background IP. In the event that any Development IP is jointly invented by the Parties in accordance with applicable intellectual property laws, then the ownership of such Development IP that has been jointly invented shall be co-owned by the Parties in accordance with such applicable intellectual property laws; provided, however, that neither Party shall have any duty or obligation to account to the other for any use or exploitation of such jointly invented Development IP and as between the Parties, each Party shall be entitled to retain any and all benefit, financial or otherwise, derived by such Party from such jointly invented Development IP. 8.3. Prosecution and Enforcement of Development IP. Except as set forth below, Qualigen shall have the sole right to prepare, file applications on and registrations for, prosecute, obtain, maintain, defend and enforce all Intellectual Property Rights in the Development IP in such manner as Qualigen deems appropriate in its sole discretion, including incurring and paying all expenses required for such purposes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Qualigen shall use commercially reasonable efforts to preserve, obtain and maintain in the Applicable Markets all material Development IP and Qualigen Background IP related to or used in connection with the development and manufacturing of the Products as well as any improvements or alternative embodiments thereof, and shall consult Sekisui before determining not to pursue in any Applicable Market any particular Intellectual Property Rights related to any product development efforts covered by the Development Plan. In the event that Qualigen elects not to prosecute or maintain in a particular Applicable Market country any Patent Rights in the jointly developed Development IP (the "Abandoned Joint IP"), Sekisui may elect to prosecute such Abandoned Joint IP in such particular Applicable Market country, in which case the Patent Rights for such Abandoned Joint IP in such particular in Applicable Market country shall be owned solely by Sekisui. 12

8.4. Marks. During and after the Term, neither Party shall register, use or claim ownership or other rights in any logo, trade name, brand name or trademark of the other Party in existence during the Term (nor any logo, trade name, brand name or trademark confusingly similar to any logo, trade name, brand name or trademark of the other Party in existence during the Term), nor assist anyone else to do so, nor make or assist in any challenge to any logo, trade name, brand name or trademark of the other Party in existence during the Term. 9. Sale Transaction 9.1. Exclusivity Period. The parties anticipate that they will entertain a potential acquisition of Qualigen by Sekisui during 2018 on terms to be mutually agreed. Accordingly, Qualigen hereby agrees that during the Exclusivity Period, Qualigen shall not, directly or indirectly, through its affiliates, agents, stockholders, officers, directors or otherwise solicit, initiate, participate in discussions or negotiations or otherwise cooperate in any way with, or provide any information to any person, entity or group other than Sekisui concerning a Sale Transaction. In the event that Qualigen nonetheless receives an unsolicited offer to engage in a Sale Transaction during such Exclusivity Period, Qualigen may engage with such party to the extent legally required to comply with its fiduciary duties, so long as Qualigen (i) promptly communicates to Sekisui the material terms of any proposal or offer or request for information which it may receive in respect of any such proposed Sale Transaction, including the purchase price, form and timing of consideration and the identity of the acquirer, and (ii) complies with Sekisui's Right of First Refusal (as defined below). 9.2. Negotiation Period. No later than July 1, 2018 (and sooner upon Sekisui's written request at any time before July 1, 2018), the parties shall engage in good faith negotiations for a period of up to 6 months (the "Negotiation Period") with respect to a potential acquisition by Sekisui of Qualigen. During the Negotiation Period, Qualigen shall provide to Sekisui all due diligence information reasonably requested by Sekisui so that it may make an informed offer to acquire Qualigen. Any Financing Payments made by Sekisui will be credited against any such Sale Transaction agreed to between Sekisui and Qualigen. If the parties do not mutually agree to the terms of such potential acquisition within the Negotiation Period then the Exclusivity Period shall end and, subject to Sekisui's Right of First Refusal, Qualigen shall be free to negotiate the terms of a Sale Transaction with any Third Party. 9.3. Right of First Refusal. During the Term, Sekisui shall have a right of first refusal to match the terms of any arms length, bona fide proposed Sale Transaction with a Third Party ("Sekisui's Right of First Refusal"). Qualigen shall provide Sekisui with at least 30 days prior written notice and access to all due diligence materials provided to any potential acquirer, such 30 day period to commence upon the notification to Sekisui that Qualigen's board of directors has approved such Proposed Sale Transaction (as set forth in a term sheet or draft definitive agreement provided to Sekisui), subject to Sekisui's Right of First Refusal. At any time during such 30 day period, Sekisui may elect to match the terms of such proposal. Sekisui will be credited in any such proposal by the cumulative amount of all Financing Payments made to date. For example, if a Third Party offers to acquire Qualigen for $50,000,000 and Sekisui has funded the full $6,200,000 of Financing Payments, Sekisui's Right of First Refusal to match the proposed transaction would be a price of $43,800,000. In the event that Sekisui elects not to move forward with such proposal for a Sale Transaction, Qualigen shall have a period of 120 days to consummate a Sale Transaction on the same terms as provided to Sekisui. If a Sale Transaction has not been consummated within such 120 days period, any Sale Transaction must once again comply with the provisions of this Section 9.3. 13

9.4. Penalty for Breach. In the event of any breach of Sections 9.1 through 9.3, including without limitation, any actions by stockholders of Qualigen that result in a Sale Transaction without complying with Sections 9.1 through 9.3 above, or otherwise hinder the intent and purpose of the provisions of Sections 9.1 through 9.3 above, in addition to any other remedies available to Sekisui under the terms of this Agreement, including the right to specific performance and other equitable remedies, Sekisui shall be entitled to liquidated damages in the amount of three times any and all Financing Payments made to date. For the avoidance of doubt, this clause does not apply to a failure of the stockholders of Qualigen to approve a Sale Transaction proposed by Sekisui, so long as such stockholders did not approve a Sale Transaction on the same terms with a Third Party during the Term. 9.5. Molecular Clinical Diagnostics. In furtherance of the foregoing, during the Exclusivity Period, Qualigen shall, in consultation with Sekisui, take commercially reasonable steps to seek to regain any rights in any Qualigen molecular clinical diagnostic product technology that Qualigen has previously granted to Gen-Probe, Hologic, or any of their affiliates. 10. Representations and Warranties 10.1. By Qualigen. Qualigen hereby represents, warrants and covenants that: (a) Qualigen has the full right, power and corporate authority to enter into this Agreement, and to make the promises set forth in this Agreement, and to grant the rights herein, and that there are no outstanding agreements, assignments or encumbrances in existence inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement and that this Agreement is enforceable against Qualigen. (b) The Products supplied to Sekisui under this Agreement shall conform to the applicable product specifications and shall not infringe upon the patents or proprietary rights of any Third Party. To the extent any Third Party owns any patents or proprietary rights relating to the use, sale, or manufacture of a Product in the Territory, Qualigen represents and warrants that it has sufficient valid rights from such Third Party under which (1) Qualigen may manufacture and sell such Product to Sekisui, and (2) Sekisui may use and sell such Products royalty free in the Territory. (c) As of the Effective Date, Qualigen has not been notified with respect to, and to Qualigen's best knowledge there is no patent infringement action pending before any court or governmental agency or other tribunal relating to any Product. (d) As of the Effective Date, Qualigen has not been notified with respect to, and to Qualigen's best knowledge no material actions are pending before any court or governmental agency or other tribunal relating to any Product. (e) All Product delivered to Sekisui or Sekisui's customers pursuant to this Agreement, at the time of such delivery, shall not be adulterated or misbranded within the meaning of any applicable law, regulation or guideline effective at the time of delivery and shall not be an article which may not be introduced into interstate commerce under any applicable law, regulation or guideline. 14

(f) The manufacturing facilities and processes utilized for the manufacture of each Product shall comply with applicable FDA regulations including, without limitation, applicable current Good Manufacturing Practices as described in 21 CFR 820. Qualigen does not represent, warrant or covenant that the Development Plan will be successfully accomplished, that the Development Plan will produce any particular results or any favorable results, that the Development Plan will result in any Development IP (or in any valuable Development IP), that the Products (if any) arising from the Development Plan can ever receive Regulatory Approvals or be successfully or profitably commercialized, or that any other current or future Products can be successfully or profitably commercialized by Sekisui. Moreover, Sekisui acknowledges and accepts the risks inherent in attempting to develop and commercialize any medical product. There is no implied representation that any Products can be successfully developed or commercialized. Qualigen shall provide to Sekisui and for the benefit of Sekisui's customers of Products a standard commercial written warranty that the Products will be free of defects in materials or workmanship starting from the date the Product has been received by Sekisui's customer and ending after the length of time stated for the applicable Product on Exhibit D hereto (the "User Warranty"). The User Warranty is contingent upon proper use of a Product in the application for which such Product was intended and does not cover Products that were altered or modified (or added to or subtracted from), that were used after the expiration date thereon or that were subjected by the carrier, distributor or the customer to abuse, mishandling or unusual physical, thermal, chemical or electrical stress. 10.2. By Sekisui. Sekisui represents, warrants and covenants that: (a) Sekisui has the full right, power and corporate authority to enter into this Agreement and to make the promises set forth in this Agreement and that there are no outstanding agreements, assignments or encumbrances in existence inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement and that this Agreement is enforceable against Sekisui. (b) As of the Effective Date, Sekisui has not been notified in writing with respect to, nor is there, to Sekisui's best knowledge, any patent infringement action pending before any court or governmental agency or other tribunal relating to Sekisui's sale or distribution of the Products. (c) As of the Effective Date, Sekisui has not been notified in writing with respect to, nor is there, to Sekisui's best knowledge, any action pending preventing Sekisui from selling and distributing the Products in the Territory. (d) Sekisui shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain before distribution of each Product, all licenses, registrations and permits required to enable Sekisui to act as a distributor of such Product in the Territory. (e) Sekisui shall not make, or advise its customers to make, any alterations or modifications to, or any additions to or subtractions from, any Product. (f) Sekisui shall make no attempt to reverse-engineer any Product nor encourage or assist anyone else to do so. 15

10.3. No Implied Warranties. The express warranties set forth in this Section 10 and elsewhere in this Agreement are provided in lieu of, and EACH PARTY HEREBY DISCLAIMS, all other warranties, express and implied, relating to the subject matter of this Agreement. EXCEPT FOR THE EXPRESS WARRANTIES SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER PARTY MAKES ANY OTHER WARRANTY, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, TO THE OTHER PARTY WITH RESPECT TO THE PRODUCTS OR THE OTHER SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT. THE PARTIES EXPRESSLY EXCLUDE ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR OF MERCHANTABILITY. Each Party's representations, warranties and/or covenants under this Agreement are solely for the benefit of the other Party and may be asserted only by the other Party and not by anyone else (including without limitation any customer of the other Party; provide, however, that end user customers may assert the User Warranty against Qualigen). 11. Indemnities 11.1. Indemnification by Sekisui. Sekisui shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Qualigen, and its directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives (collectively, the "Qualigen Indemnitees") from and against any and all claims, suits and proceedings by a Third Party (individually and collectively, "Claims"), and any and all losses, obligations, damages, deficiencies, costs, penalties, liabilities, assessments, judgments, amounts paid in settlement, fines and expenses (including court costs and reasonable fees and expenses of attorneys), incurred in the investigation, defense and/or settlement of any Claims (individually and collectively, "Losses"; it being expressly understood, however, that incidental, special, indirect and consequential damages and lost profits, lost savings and interruptions of business are expressly excluded therefrom and from such defined term): (a) arising out of the negligence or willful misconduct of Sekisui or its directors, officers, employees, agents or representatives in the performance of Sekisui's obligations under this Agreement; or (b) arising out of or in connection with a breach or violation by Sekisui or its subdistributor of any applicable law or a material breach by Sekisui of any of its obligations under this Agreement, including any representations or warranties set forth herein; provided, however, that Sekisui shall have no liability or obligation to any Qualigen Indemnitee for any Claims or Losses to the extent that such Claims or Losses are primarily caused by a Qualigen Indemnitee's breach of applicable law, breach of this Agreement, negligence or willful misconduct. 11.2. Indemnification by Qualigen. Qualigen shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Sekisui and its directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives (collectively, the "Sekisui Indemnitees") from and against any and all Losses incurred in the investigation, defense and/ or settlement of any Claims: (a) related to bodily injury, death or property damage directly caused by any Product which has not been altered or modified (or added to or subtracted from) in any way, has been handled, stored, transported and used in accordance with Qualigen's guidelines and has not been used after its expiration date or subjected to abuse, mishandling or unusual physical, thermal, chemical or electrical stress; (b) arising out of the negligence or willful misconduct of Qualigen or its directors, officers, employees, agents or representatives; (c) arising out of a breach or violation by Qualigen of any applicable law or a material breach by Qualigen of any of its obligations under this Agreement, including any representations or warranties set forth herein; or (d) arising out of any claim that any of the manufacture, marketing, import, offer for sale, sale, or use of any Product infringes upon any patent, proprietary, or intellectual property right of any Third Party in the Territory; provided, however, that Qualigen shall have no liability or obligation to any Sekisui Indemnitee for any Claims or Losses to the extent that such Claims or Losses are primarily caused by a Sekisui Indemnitee's (or any other entity or person within the Sekisui corporate family's) breach of applicable law, breach of this Agreement, negligence or willful misconduct. 16

11.3. Patent Indemnity. Qualigen and Sekisui shall notify each other promptly in writing of any action (and all prior claims relating to such action) brought against Qualigen or Sekisui alleging that the manufacture, marketing, import, offer for sale, sale or use of a Product constitute infringement of the intellectual property rights of a Third Party, and (provided that such a Claim does not arise from Sekisui's noncompliance with Sections 3.6, 8.4, 10.2(b), 10.2(c), 10.2(e) or 10.2(f) of this Agreement (e.g., Sekisui has altered a Product or has used a Sekisui trademark in connection with a Product)) Qualigen agrees to defend Sekisui in such action at its expense and shall pay any costs or damages finally awarded against Sekisui in any such action; provided, that Qualigen shall have had sole control of the defense of any such action and all negotiations for its settlement or compromise and provided further that no settlement or compromise shall be binding on a Party hereto without its prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. In the event a lawsuit is filed against Sekisui or Qualigen alleging that the manufacture, marketing, import, offer for sale, sale or use of a Product constitute infringement of the intellectual property rights of a Third Party, or Qualigen files an action for declaratory judgment because of a serious threat of such a lawsuit, or if in Qualigen's reasonable business judgment a Product is likely to become the subject of a claim of infringement of a patent or other intellectual property right; then Qualigen may, at its expense, and may request Sekisui's assistance to, attempt to obtain a license to such patent or other intellectual property right. 11.4. Indemnification Procedures. The Party or other Indemnitee intending to claim indemnification under this Section 11 (an "Indemnified Party") shall promptly notify the other Party (the "Indemnifying Party") of any Claim in respect of which the Indemnified Party intends to claim such indemnification (provided, that no delay or deficiency on the part of the Indemnified Party in so notifying the Indemnifying Party will relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability or obligation under this Agreement except to the extent the Indemnifying Party has suffered actual prejudice directly caused by the delay or other deficiency), and the Indemnifying Party shall assume the defense thereof (with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party) whether or not such Claim is rightfully brought; provided, however, that an Indemnified Party shall have the right to retain its own counsel and participate in the defense thereof, with the fees and expenses to be paid by the Indemnified Party, unless the Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense or unless a representation of both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to the actual or potential differing interests between them, in which case the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel retained by the Indemnified Party shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, in no event shall the Indemnifying Party be required to pay for more than one separate counsel no matter the number or circumstances of all Indemnified Parties. If the Indemnifying Party shall fail to timely assume the defense of and reasonably defend such Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to retain or assume control of such defense and the Indemnifying Party shall pay (as incurred and on demand) the fees and expenses of counsel retained by the Indemnified Party and all other expenses of investigation and litigation. The Indemnified Party, and its directors, officers, advisers, agents and employees, shall cooperate fully with the Indemnifying Party and its legal representatives in the investigations of any Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for the indemnification of any Claim settled (or resolved by consent to the entry of judgment) without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party. Also, if the Indemnifying Party shall control the defense of any such Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to settle such Claim; provided, that the Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of the Indemnified Party before entering into any settlement of (or resolving by consent to the entry of judgment upon) such Claim unless (A) there is no finding or admission of any violation of law or any violation of the rights of any person or entity by an Indemnified Party, no requirement that the Indemnified Party admit fault or culpability, and no adverse effect on any other claims that may be made by or against the Indemnified Party and (B) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party and such settlement does not require the Indemnified Party to take (or refrain from taking) any action. 17

Regardless of who controls the defense, the other Party hereto shall reasonably cooperate in the defense as may be requested. Without limitation, the Party hereto which is not the Indemnifying Party and (if different) the Indemnified Party, and their respective directors, officers, advisers, agents and employees, shall cooperate fully with the Indemnifying Party and its legal representatives in the investigation and defense of any Claim. 11.5. Expenses of Enforcement. As the Parties intend complete indemnification, all costs and expenses of enforcing any provision of this Section 11 shall also be reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party except as otherwise set forth in Section 11.4. 11.6. Insurance. Qualigen, at its own expense, shall procure and maintain during the Term, insurance policies with the minimum coverages set forth below ("Insurance"). Sekisui shall be named as an additional insured with respect to the Insurance. The Insurance shall be primary for all purposes to other insurance coverage, whether such other insurance is stated to be primary, contributory, excess, contingent or otherwise, without recourse to or contribution from any Sekisui-owned coverage. (a) Commercial General Liability Insurance - Combined single limit for bodily and property damage of not less than $1,000,000 for each occurrence and $2,000,000 annual aggregate providing: ● Assault and Battery coverage, ● Broad form property damage coverage, ● Broad form contractual liability coverage, ● Products and completed operations coverage, and ● Personal and advertising injury coverage. (b) Workers' Compensation and Employer's Liability Insurance - With limits of liability for: ● Workers' compensation as required by statute; ● Employer's liability for bodily injury by accident: $500,000 each accident; bodily injury by disease: $500,000 policy limit; and bodily injury by disease: $500,000 each employee. All Qualigen's Insurance shall be placed with an insurer that (a) has an A.M. Best rating of A- or better or (b) is a qualified self- insurance program that is approved by Sekisui. Qualigen shall provide Sekisui, upon request, with written evidence of the Insurance, including where it is provided through qualified self-insurance. Nothing in this Section shall be deemed to limit Qualigen's responsibility to the amounts stated above or to any limits of Qualigen's insurance policies. 12. Regulatory Matters 12.1. Regulatory Approval. Qualigen shall be responsible for maintaining, at its sole cost, the Regulatory Approvals required for the marketing and sale of the Products in the Applicable Markets. Qualigen shall hold in its name all Regulatory Approvals required for the marketing and sale of the Products in a country or region and shall (to the extent commercially reasonable to do so) maintain in good standing all existing Regulatory Approvals. Qualigen and Sekisui shall provide reasonable advice and assistance to each other as may be necessary to maintain required Regulatory Approvals. In addition, Qualigen shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain Regulatory Approval for any additional territories upon Sekisui's commercially reasonable request. 18

12.2. Distribution Approvals. Sekisui shall be responsible for seeking, obtaining and maintaining (i) all licenses, registrations and permits (excluding patents) required to be obtained by Sekisui to enable Sekisui to act as a distributor of the Product pursuant to this Agreement, and (ii) all approvals from the Regulatory Authorities regarding marketing and advertising materials to be used by Sekisui to promote the Product. Qualigen shall cooperate with Sekisui in making and maintaining all filings that may be necessary or desirable in connection with obtaining and maintaining any regulatory approvals necessary for Sekisui to act as a distributor of the Product in the Applicable Markets. 12.3. Communication With Agencies. In the Applicable Markets, Qualigen shall have responsibility for communications with the Regulatory Authorities concerning any required Regulatory Approvals, approval of Product related marketing and advertising materials, and Product quality matters. 12.4. Governmental Warnings. Each Party shall advise the other Party promptly (but in any event within no more than 48 hours) of any warning (including any FDA Form 483), citation, indictment, claim, lawsuit, or proceeding issued or instituted by any federal, state or local governmental entity or agency against the Party, or of any revocation of any license or permit if, and only to the extent that, the manufacture, storage, or handling of the Product, or the marketing, selling, promotion or distribution of the Product, is affected. 12.5. Adverse Events, Recalls and Field Corrections. Qualigen shall have responsibility to determine whether any Adverse Events, Recalls or Field Corrections information must be reported to the FDA (under United States law) or any other Regulatory Authorities and Qualigen shall have responsibility to prepare and submit notification of Adverse Events, Recalls and/or Field Corrections to respective Regulatory Authorities for the Products. Qualigen shall provide prompt notice to Sekisui of any Adverse Events, Recalls or Field Corrections, which notice shall in any event be delivered within no more than 3 business days from Qualigen learning of such occurrence. 12.6. Complaints. Qualigen shall receive, investigate in a timely manner, and as appropriate, resolve customer complaints in the Territory. If an investigation is needed in response to a complaint or inquiry related to the Product, Qualigen shall perform the investigation and shall bear the cost of such investigation. The documentation of such investigation shall include, but not be limited to, investigation results, cause analysis, corrective and preventative action and health hazard/medical assessment, as appropriate. In the event a Product is returned by a customer for investigation, Qualigen shall ship a replacement Product to the customer. (Provided, that if a request for a return of Product is due to a change of mind over using the Product or the Sekisui customer has overstocked the product, rather than due to a warranty issue, Qualigen need not accept the return or provide any replacement or substitute.) Qualigen shall retain records of all Product related complaints, or Adverse Events for a period of not less than five (5) years beyond the expiration date of the Product or for such longer period as may be required by applicable law. Qualigen shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that all complaints are appropriately closed within 90 days or less from the receipt of such complaint. 19

12.7. Product Recalls. In the event that (i) any Applicable Market governmental agency or authority issues a request or directive or orders that the Products be recalled or retrieved, (ii) an Applicable Market court of competent jurisdiction orders that the Products be recalled or retrieved, or (iii) Qualigen and Sekisui reasonably determine, after mutual consultation, that the Products should be recalled, corrected or retrieved in any particular country or countries, Qualigen and/or Sekisui shall conduct such activity and the parties shall take all appropriate corrective actions and shall execute the steps detailed in the recall strategy. Qualigen shall be responsible for the content of any communication to the customers regarding any Recall or Field Correction. In the event such action results from Sekisui's gross negligence or willful misconduct, Sekisui shall be responsible for the expenses thereof. Otherwise, Qualigen shall be responsible for the expenses of the action. Sekisui and Qualigen shall cooperate fully with one another in conducting any such action. Sekisui shall destroy units of Products lawfully recalled only upon Qualigen's (or any governmental authority's) written instruction to destroy such units of Products, and only then in accordance with Qualigen's procedures and instructions. Otherwise, Sekisui shall return the recalled units of Product to Qualigen in accordance with Qualigen's procedures and instructions after completion of the action. 12.8. European Union Vigilance and Canada Mandatory Problem Reporting. In the event that Qualigen receives any Potentially Serious Complaints regarding the Products from a customer located in the European Union or Canada, then Qualigen shall notify Sekisui promptly, but in any event within no more than (3) business days.

13. Confidential Information; Audit Rights 13.1. Confidentiality Obligation. It is contemplated that in the course of the performance of this Agreement each Party may, from time to time, disclose proprietary and confidential information to the other ("Confidential Information"). Except to the extent expressly authorized by this Agreement or otherwise agreed to in writing, during the Term and for a period of five (5) years following the expiration or termination of this Agreement, the receiving Party shall disclose the other Party's Confidential Information only to its own (or its Affiliates') officers, employees, consultants, Third Party service providers, attorneys, accountants, agents, bankers, lenders, prospective lenders and prospective equity investors, and in each case only if and to the extent necessary to carry out their respective responsibilities under this Agreement or in accordance with the exercise of their rights under this Agreement or in accordance with customary permitted practice (such as to seek or maintain financing or credit), and such disclosure shall be limited to the maximum extent possible consistent with such responsibilities and rights. Except as set forth in the foregoing sentence, neither Party shall disclose Confidential Information of the other to any Third Party without the other's prior written consent. In all events, however, any and all disclosure to a Third Party (or to any such Affiliate) shall be pursuant to the terms of a non-disclosure/nonuse agreement no less restrictive than this Section 13 (or, in the case of attorneys, to a duty and obligation of nondisclosure/nonuse pursuant to the applicable rules of the profession). The Party which disclosed Confidential Information of the other to any Third Party (or to any such Affiliate) shall be responsible and liable for any disclosure or use by such Third Party or Affiliate (or its disclosees) which would have violated this Agreement if committed by the Party itself. Neither Party shall use Confidential Information of the other except as expressly allowed by and for the purposes of this Agreement or in accordance with the exercise of their rights under this Agreement or in accordance with customary permitted practice (such as to seek or maintain financing or credit) or and, after the Term, by Qualigen only to the extent required to continue to offer and provide goods and services to former Sekisui customers of Products. Each Party shall take such action to preserve the confidentiality of each other's Confidential Information as it would customarily take to preserve the confidentiality of its own Confidential Information (but in no event less than a reasonable standard of care). Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, each Party, upon the other's request, promptly shall return or destroy all the Confidential Information disclosed to the other Party pursuant to this Agreement, including all copies, reflections, analyses and extracts of documents, except for one archival copy (and such electronic copies that exist as part of the Party's computer systems, network storage systems and electronic backup systems) of such materials solely to be able to monitor its obligations that survive under this Agreement. The non-use and non-disclosure obligations set forth in this Section 13 shall not apply to any Confidential Information, or portion thereof, that the receiving Party can demonstrate: (a) is at the time of disclosure in the public domain; 21

(b) after disclosure, becomes part of the public domain, by publication or otherwise, through no fault of and or without violation of any duty of confidentiality of the receiving Party or its disclosees; (c) at the time of disclosure is already in the receiving Party's possession with no duty of confidentiality, and such prior possession can be demonstrated by the receiving Party by written proof (provided that this subsection shall not apply to Confidential Information exchanged between the Parties before the execution of this Agreement that was subject to a confidentiality obligation at the time of such disclosure); (d) is rightfully received by the receiving Party on a non-confidential basis from an independent Third Party without obligation of confidentiality; provided, however, that to the receiving Party's best knowledge, such information was not obtained by said Third Party, directly or indirectly, from the disclosing Party; or (e) is independently developed by or expressly for the receiving Party, in either case solely by personnel without any access to or use of the disclosing Party's Confidential Information, as shown by receiving Party's contemporaneous written records. In the event either Party must disclose the other Party's Confidential Information in order to comply with applicable governmental regulations or as otherwise required by law or judicial process, such Party shall give reasonable advance notice to the other Party of such proposed disclosure in order that the non-disclosing Party may intercede and oppose such process, and shall use its best efforts to secure a protective order or confidential-treatment order preventing or limiting (to the greatest possible extent and for the longest possible period) the disclosure and/or requiring that the Confidential Information so disclosed be used only for the purposes for which the law or regulation required, or for which the order was issued. The Parties acknowledge that the defined term "Confidential Information" shall include not only a disclosing Party's own Confidential Information but also Confidential Information of an Affiliate or of a Third Party which is in the possession of a disclosing Party. However, both Parties agree not to disclose to the other Party any Confidential Information of a Third Party which is in the possession of such Party, unless the other Party has given an express prior written consent (which specifies the owner of such Confidential Information) to receive such particular Confidential Information. 22

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other agreement between Sekisui and Qualigen, nothing in this Agreement or any other agreement between the Parties prohibits, or is intended in any manner to prohibit, either Sekisui or Qualigen from reporting possible violations of federal law or regulation to any governmental agency or entity, including but not limited to the Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Congress, and any agency Inspector General, or making other disclosures that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of federal law or regulation. Sekisui and Qualigen do not need the prior authorization of anyone at the other Party or the other Party's legal counsel to make any such reports or disclosures and they are not required to notify the other Party that it has made such reports or disclosures. 13.2. Use of Names. During the Term, Sekisui is hereby permitted to use the Qualigen name and any Qualigen content (including the content of any existing sales collateral and marketing materials) in any sales collateral, marketing materials or other communications used in connection with the marketing and sales of the Product with the prior written consent of Qualigen, which consent shall not be reasonably withheld or delayed. Other than as provided in the foregoing sentence or to the extent such use is based on a public disclosure previously made by the other Party, during the Term neither Qualigen nor Sekisui shall use the name of the other in any verbal or written communications with any Third Party, except as allowed or contemplated herein, without the prior written consent of the other Party. 13.3. Press Releases. Neither Party shall make any press release or other similar public announcement concerning this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event such disclosure or public announcement is required to be made on a more immediate basis to comply with applicable laws, then approval will be deemed granted if no response is received from the non-disclosing Party within the time frames required by law; provided, however, that the disclosing Party provides the non-disclosing Party with notice of the legally required time frame for the approval of the disclosure. Neither Party shall use the trademark or logo of the other Party, its Affiliates or their respective employee(s) in any publicity, promotion, news release or public disclosure relating to this Agreement or its subject matter, except as may be required by law or except with the prior express written permission of such other Party, such permission not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, or except in Sekisui's advertisement, promotion and sale of the Products in compliance with this Agreement in the ordinary course of business. Notwithstanding the above, once a public disclosure has been made, either Party shall be free to disclose to Third Parties any information contained in said public disclosure, without further pre-review or pre-approval. 13.4. Audit Rights. Each Party shall keep accurate books and records in sufficient detail to comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations and this Agreement and enable the other Party to determine the correctness of any report made under this Agreement and monitor compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations and this Agreement through the process below. Upon reasonable written notice (and no more often than once every 150 days), the auditing Party shall have the right, during normal business hours, to audit the books and records maintained by the audited Party pursuant to this Agreement to ensure the accuracy of all reports and payments made hereunder. 23

14. Termination 14.1. Termination by Either Party. Either Party may terminate this Agreement (i) immediately upon written notice in the event of the closing of a Sale Transaction; or (ii) immediately upon written notice if the other files a voluntary bankruptcy petition or makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors or becomes subject to any order for relief or involuntary bankruptcy petition under any bankruptcy, liquidation, insolvency or similar law which is not dismissed within 60 days. 14.2. Termination by Qualigen. Qualigen may terminate this Agreement (i) upon thirty (30) days prior written notice in the event of any failure of Sekisui to make a Financing Payment that is determined to be due, which failure is not cured within such 30 day period, or (ii) upon sixty (60) days prior written notice in the event of any material breach of the diligence obligations (which is understood not to include failing to meet forecasts for sales to customers) set forth in the Business Plan (as it may be amended by the Parties from time to time), which breach is not cured within such 60 day period. 14.3. Termination by Sekisui. Sekisui may terminate this Agreement upon prior written notice (i) in the event of any failure of Qualigen to meet a milestone set forth in the Development Plan (as it may be amended by the Parties from time to time), or (ii) at any other time upon ninety (90) days' prior written notice of impending termination. 14.4. Effect of Termination. Sections 4.6, 5.5, 8.1, 8.2, 11.1-11.4, 13, 14.4 and 15 shall survive the later of the expiration or termination of the Term. In addition, all provisions that survive termination, that are irrevocable or that arise due to termination shall survive in accordance with their terms. Any other provisions of this Agreement contemplated by their terms to pertain to a period of time following termination or expiration of this Agreement shall survive only for the specified period of time. Upon the expiration or termination of the Term, (i) Sekisui shall cooperate in permitting Qualigen to offer to rehire any Sekisui sales representatives who are primarily responsible for selling the Products as set forth in Section 4.6, (ii) Sekisui shall transfer to Qualigen the ownership of any Sekisui Instruments (subject to reimbursement from Qualigen for the book value (original cost less depreciation) of such Sekisui Instruments), (iii) Qualigen shall reimburse Sekisui for a prorated portion of all prepaid distribution fees paid by Sekisui during the final year of this Agreement to subdistributors, (iv) Sekisui shall assign to Qualigen each subdistributor agreement which Qualigen requests be assigned to Qualigen, and (v) each Party shall remain liable for its obligations accrued before the effective date of such expiration or termination (and for avoidance of doubt: upon expiration or termination Sekisui shall remain liable to pay Qualigen all Financing Payments then due under the Development Plan based upon the milestones that Qualigen has completed by the date of such expiration or termination). In the event there are unfulfilled orders for Products outstanding as of termination of this Agreement, Sekisui may, at its option, cancel such orders upon notice to Qualigen (in which case Qualigen agrees to fill such orders to Sekisui's end customers directly unless such customer chooses to cancel such order) or cause Qualigen to fulfill such orders and invoice Sekisui for amounts owed with respect thereto. If either Party is aware of an impending expiration or termination of the Term, it shall conduct its business with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement in the ordinary course (and not otherwise than in the ordinary course) for the duration of the Term. 24

15. Miscellaneous 15.1. Independent Contractor. For the purpose of the Agreement each Party shall be, and shall be deemed to be, an independent contractor and not an agent, partner, joint venturer or employee of the other Party. Neither Party shall have authority to make any statements, representations or commitments of any kind, or to take any action which shall be binding on the other Party (except as may be explicitly provided for herein or authorized in writing), and each Party agrees not to purport to do so. 15.2. Assignment. The Agreement shall not be assigned and is not assignable or delegable by either Party without the written consent of the other, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, that Sekisui and Qualigen each may assign this Agreement without the consent of the other to a successor in connection with the merger, consolidation or sale of such Party or of all or substantially all of its assets or the portion of its business to which this Agreement relates. 15.3. No Waiver. Failure of either Party to enforce (or reasonable delay in enforcing) a right under this Agreement shall not act as a waiver of that right or the ability to later assert that right relative to the particular situation involved or to terminate this Agreement arising out of any subsequent default or breach. A waiver by a Party of any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement in any instance shall not be deemed or construed to be a waiver of such term or condition for the future, or of any other term or condition hereof. 15.4. Severability. This Agreement is divisible and separable. If any provision of this Agreement is determined by a final and binding court judgment (for which no further appeal is possible) to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable to any extent, such provision shall not be not affected or impaired up to the limits of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability; the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected or impaired in any way; and the affected provision shall (if at all possible) be construed as if it had been written in such a way as to both be valid, legal and enforceable and to achieve, to the greatest lawful extent, the evident economic, business and other purposes of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision (or portion of provision). 15.5. Notices. All notices required or permitted under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed given and made (i) if by personal delivery, on the date of such delivery, (ii) if by recognized overnight courier specifying next-business-day delivery, on the next business day after the date of deposit with such courier (by the courier's stated time for enabling next-business-day delivery), (iii) if by email, on the date sent by email if sent during normal business hours of the recipient, and on the next business day if sent after normal business hours of the recipient, and (iv) if by US registered mail, on the fifth business day following such mailing in the US, in each case addressed at the address shown below for, or such other address as may be designated by 10 days' advance written notice hereunder by, such Party.

Entire Agreement and Modification. The Agreement, including the Exhibits thereto, constitutes the entire understanding between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes and cancels any previous or contemporaneous agreements or understandings, whether oral, written or implied, heretofore in effect, including any letter of intent, and sets forth the entire agreement between Sekisui and Qualigen with respect to the subject matter hereof (provided, that any and all previous nondisclosure/nonuse obligations, including the July 7, 2015 Confidential Disclosure Agreement) are not superseded and remain in full force and effect for all disclosures made prior to the date of this Agreement). Each Party acknowledges that it has not relied, in deciding whether to enter into this Agreement on this Agreement's expressly stated terms and conditions, on any representations, warranties, agreements, commitments or promises which are not expressly set forth within this Agreement. No agreements amending, altering, supplementing or waiving the terms hereof may be made except by the express terms of a written document signed by duly authorized representatives of the Parties. 15.7. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed and interpreted in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without reference to its conflicts of laws principles. The parties agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall be inapplicable to this Agreement. 15.8. Attorney Fees. If litigation becomes necessary to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, the successful Party shall be entitled to recover from the other Party reasonable expenses, including attorneys' and other professional fees, in addition to any other available remedies. 26

15.9. Headings. The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and are in no way intended to describe, interpret, define or limit the scope, extent or intent of this Agreement or any provision hereof. 15.10. Counterparts; Delivery. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. Signatures to this Agreement may be delivered by email attachment or other electronic transmission, and such signatures and such delivery shall be fully effective and binding on the Party sending the same. 15.11. Further Assurances. Each Party covenants and agrees to, without the necessity of any further consideration, execute, acknowledge and deliver any and all such further or other documents and instruments and take any such further or other action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to carry out the purposes and intent of this Agreement. 15.12. Force Majeure. No Party shall be liable to any other Party or be deemed to have breached or defaulted under this Agreement for failure or delay in the performance of any of its obligations under this Agreement (other than obligations for the payment of money) for the time and to the extent such failure or delay is caused by or results from acts of God, earthquake, riot, civil commotion, terrorism, war, strikes or other labor disputes, fire, flood, failure or delay of transportation, omissions or delays in acting by a governmental authority, acts of a government or an agency thereof or judicial orders or decrees or restrictions or any other like reason which is beyond the control of the respective Party. The Party affected by force majeure shall provide the other Party with full particulars thereof as soon as it becomes aware of the same (including its best estimate of the likely extent and duration of the interference with its activities), and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to overcome the difficulties created thereby and to resume performance of its obligations hereunder as soon as practicable, and the time for performance shall be extended for a number of days equal to the duration of the force majeure. 15.13. Equitable Relief. Each Party recognizes that the covenants and agreements herein and their continued performance as set forth in this Agreement are necessary and critical to protect the legitimate interests of the other Party, that the other Party would not have entered into this Agreement in the absence of such covenants and agreements and the assurance of continued performance as set forth in this Agreement, and that a Party's breach or threatened breach of such covenants and agreements will cause the opposed Party irreparable harm and significant injury, the amount of which will be extremely difficult to estimate and ascertain, thus making any remedy at law or in damages inadequate. Therefore, each Party agrees that an opposed Party shall be entitled to specific performance, an order restraining any breach or threatened breach of Section 13 and all other provisions of this Agreement, and any other equitable relief (including but not limited to temporary, preliminary and/or permanent injunctive relief), without the necessity of posting of any bond or security. This right shall be in addition to and not exclusive of any other remedy available to such other Party at law or in equity. 15.14. Rights and Remedies are Cumulative. Except to the extent as may be expressly set forth herein, all rights, remedies, undertakings, obligations and agreements contained in or available upon violation of this Agreement shall be cumulative and none of them shall be in limitation of any other remedy or right authorized in law or in equity, or any undertaking, obligation or agreement of the applicable Party. 27

15.15. Third Party Beneficiaries. Except as expressly set forth in Section 11, the terms and provisions of this Agreement are intended solely for the benefit of each Party hereto and their respective successors or permitted assigns and it is not the intention of the Parties to confer third-party beneficiary rights upon any other person. 15.16. No Implied License. No right or license is granted to Sekisui by implication, estoppel, or otherwise to any know-how, patent or other intellectual property right owned or controlled by Qualigen. 15.17. Exhibits.
