              (iii) that is lawfully obtained by Recipient from a source          independent of the Company, which source was lawfully in possession of          the Information and which source had the unrestricted right to disclose          or display the Information to the Recipient; or

              (iv) that is required by legal process to be disclosed,          provided that Recipient will timely inform the Company of the          requirement for disclosure, will permit the Company to attempt, by          appropriate legal means, to limit such disclosure and will itself
