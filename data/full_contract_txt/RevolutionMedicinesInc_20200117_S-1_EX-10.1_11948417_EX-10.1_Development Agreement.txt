Each Party agrees to cooperate with the other Party in claiming exemptions from such deductions or withholdings under any agreement or treaty from time to time in effect.

(b) Value Added Tax. Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 9.7(a), this Section 9.7(b) will apply with respect to value added tax (or sales, use or indirect tax) ("VAT").

Such audit shall not occur more than [***] in a given Calendar Year, unless for cause, and shall not concern books and records relating to a period more than [***] preceding the current Calendar Year. Any failure by a Party to exercise its rights under this Section 9.9 with respect to a Calendar Year within such [***] period shall constitute a waiver by such Party of its right to later object to any payments made by the other Party under this Agreement during such Calendar Year.

(b) Upon completion of the audit, the auditor shall provide a report to both Parties, which report shall be limited to a description of any failure to comply with the terms of this Agreement and the amount of the financial discrepancy. Such auditor shall not disclose the audited Party's Confidential Information to the auditing Party, except to the extent such disclosure is necessary to verify the accuracy of the financial reports furnished by the audited Party or the amount of payments to or by the audited Party under this Agreement. Any amounts shown to be owed but unpaid, or overpaid and in need of reimbursement, shall be paid or refunded (as the case may be) within [***] after the auditor's report, plus interest (as set forth in Section 9.6) from the original due date (unless challenged in good faith by the audited Party in which case any dispute with respect thereto shall be resolved in accordance with Section 15.6).

(c) The auditing Party shall bear the full cost of such audit unless such audit reveals an underpayment by the audited Party that resulted from a discrepancy in the financial report provided by the audited Party for the audited period, which underpayment was more than [***] percent of the amount set forth in such report, in which case the audited Party shall reimburse the auditing Party for the costs for such audit.

(d) The auditing Party shall treat all information subject to review under this Section 9.9 in accordance with the confidentiality provisions of Article XI and the Parties shall cause the auditor to enter into a reasonably acceptable confidentiality agreement with the audited Party obligating such auditor to retain all such financial information in confidence pursuant to such confidentiality agreement. 49

(a) the negligence, recklessness or willful misconduct of any of the RevMed Indemnitees; or

(b) the material breach of any of the warranties or representations made by RevMed to Sanofi under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement; or

(c) the material breach by RevMed of any of its obligations pursuant to this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement;

except in each case ((a) through (c)), to the extent the applicable Third Party Claim and Losses arising therefrom arise or result from (i) the negligence, recklessness or willful misconduct of any Sanofi Indemnitee; (ii) the breach of any of the warranties or representations made by Sanofi to RevMed under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement; or (iii) any breach by Sanofi of its obligations pursuant to this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement.

14.2 Indemnification by Sanofi.

(a) (i) the Research, Development or Manufacture of any Products by or on behalf of Sanofi or any of its Affiliates, Sublicensees or contractors (other than by RevMed or its Affiliates), or (ii) the Commercialization of Products by or on behalf of Sanofi; or 71

(c) the material breach of any of the warranties or representations made by Sanofi to RevMed under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement; or

(d) the material breach by Sanofi of any of its obligations pursuant to this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement;

14.3 Indemnification Procedure.

(a) Notice of Claim. All indemnification claims in respect of any Sanofi Indemnitee or RevMed Indemnitee seeking indemnity under Section 14.1 or Section 14.2 (collectively, the "Indemnitees" and each an "Indemnitee") will be made solely by the corresponding Party (the "Indemnified Party"). The Indemnified Party will give the indemnifying Party (the "Indemnifying Party") prompt written notice (an "Indemnification Claim Notice") of any Losses or discovery of fact upon which such Indemnified Party intends to base a request for indemnification under Section 14.1 or Section 14.2, but failure to provide prompt notice will not relieve the Indemnifying Party from its obligation to indemnify the Indemnitee hereunder except to the extent any Losses result from such delay in providing such notice. Each Indemnification Claim Notice must contain a description of the claim and the nature and amount of such Loss (to the extent that the nature and amount of such Loss are known at such time). Together with the Indemnification Claim Notice, the Indemnified Party will furnish promptly to the Indemnifying Party copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received by any Indemnitee in connection with the Third Party Claim.

(b) Control of Defense. At its option, the Indemnifying Party may assume the defense of any Third Party Claim subject to indemnification as provided for in Section 14.1 or Section 14.2 by giving written notice to the Indemnified Party within [***] after the Indemnifying Party's receipt of an Indemnification Claim Notice. Upon assuming the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may select and appoint the lead legal counsel for the defense of the Third Party Claim. Should the Indemnifying Party assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party will not be liable to the Indemnified Party or any other Indemnitee for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party or other Indemnitee in connection with the analysis, defense or settlement of the Third Party Claim. 72

Source: REVOLUTION MEDICINES, INC., S-1, 1/17/2020





(c) Right to Participate in Defense. Without limiting Section 14.3(b), any Indemnitee will be entitled to participate in, but not control, the defense of such Third Party Claim and to employ counsel of its choice for such purpose; provided, however, that such employment will be at the Indemnitee's own expense unless (a) the employment thereof has been specifically authorized by the Indemnifying Party in writing, or (b) the Indemnifying Party has failed to assume the defense and employ counsel in accordance with Section 14.3(b) (in which case the Indemnified Party will control the defense).

(d) Settlement. With respect to any Losses relating solely to the payment of money damages in connection with a Third Party Claim and that will not result in the Indemnitee's becoming subject to injunctive or other relief or otherwise adversely affect the business of the Indemnitee in any manner, and as to which the Indemnifying Party has acknowledged in writing the obligation to indemnify the Indemnitee hereunder, the Indemnifying Party will have the sole right to consent to the entry of any judgment, enter into any settlement or otherwise dispose of such Loss, on such terms as the Indemnifying Party, in its sole discretion, will deem appropriate. The Indemnifying Party will pay all amounts on behalf of the Indemnified Party at or prior to the time of the entry of judgment. With respect to all other Losses in connection with Third Party Claims, where the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of the Third Party Claim in accordance with Section 14.3(b), the Indemnifying Party will have authority to consent to the entry of any judgment, enter into any settlement or otherwise dispose of such Loss provided it obtains the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent will be at the Indemnified Party's sole and absolute discretion). The Indemnifying Party that has assumed the defense of the Third Party Claim in accordance with Section 14.3(b) will not be liable for any settlement or other disposition of a Loss by an Indemnitee that is reached without the written consent of such Indemnifying Party. Regardless of whether the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend any Third Party Claim, no Indemnitee will admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, any Third Party Claim without first offering to the Indemnifying Party the opportunity to assume the defense of the Third Party Claim in accordance with Section 14.3(b).

(e) Cooperation. If the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party will, and will cause each other Indemnitee to, cooperate in the defense thereof and will furnish such records, information and testimony, provide such witnesses and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals as may be reasonably requested in connection with the defense of such Third Party Claim. Such cooperation will include access during normal business hours afforded to the Indemnifying Party to, and reasonable retention by the Indemnified Party of, records and information that are reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making Indemnitees and other employees and agents available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. The Indemnifying Party will reimburse the Indemnified Party for all its reasonable out-of-pocket costs in connection with such cooperation.

(f) Expenses. Except as provided above, the reasonable and verifiable costs and expenses, including fees and disbursements of counsel, incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with any claim will be reimbursed on a [***] by the Indemnifying Party, without prejudice to the Indemnifying Party's right to contest the Indemnified Party's right to indemnification and subject to refund in the event the Indemnifying Party is ultimately held not to be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party. 73

14.4 Mitigation of Loss. Each Indemnified Party shall take and shall procure that its Affiliates take all such reasonable steps and action as are reasonably necessary or as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably require in order to mitigate any Third Party Claims (or potential losses or damages) under this Article XIV. Nothing in this Agreement shall or shall be deemed to relieve any Party of any common law or other duty to mitigate any losses incurred by it.

14.5 Limitation of Liability. NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR ANY SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, OR INDIRECT DAMAGES OR LOST PROFITS ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO ANY BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT, REGARDLESS OF ANY NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, NOTHING IN THIS SECTION 14.5 IS INTENDED TO OR SHALL LIMIT OR RESTRICT THE INDEMNIFICATION RIGHTS OR OBLIGATIONS OF ANY PARTY UNDER SECTION 14.1 OR SECTION 14.2, OR DAMAGES AVAILABLE FOR A PARTY'S BREACH OF ITS OBLIGATIONS RELATING TO CONFIDENTIALITY UNDER ARTICLE XI OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY UNDER ARTICLE X.

14.6 Insurance. Each Party shall procure and maintain insurance, including product liability insurance, with respect to its activities hereunder and under the Ancillary Agreements and which is consistent with normal business practices of companies similarly situated at all times during which any SHP2 Inhibitors or Product is being clinically tested in human subjects or commercially distributed or sold. Sanofi may fulfill such obligation through self- insurance. Each Party shall provide the other Party with evidence of such insurance upon request and, in the case of RevMed, shall provide Sanofi with written notice at least [***] prior to the cancellation, non-renewal or material changes in such insurance. It is understood that such insurance shall not be construed to create a limit of either Party's liability with respect to its indemnification obligations under this Article XIV.

Article XV.

GENERAL PROVISIONS

15.1 Force Majeure. Neither Party shall be held liable to the other Party nor be deemed to have defaulted under or breached this Agreement for failure or delay in performing any obligation under this Agreement to the extent such failure or delay is caused by or results from causes beyond the reasonable control of the affected Party, including embargoes, war, acts of war (whether war be declared or not), acts of terrorism, insurrections, riots, civil commotions, strikes, lockouts or other labor disturbances (whether involving the workforce of the nonperforming Party or of any other Person), fire, floods, earthquakes or other acts of God, or acts, generally applicable action or inaction by any governmental authority (but excluding any government action or inaction that is specific to such Party, its Affiliates or Sublicensees, such as revocation or non-renewal of such Party's license to conduct business), or omissions or delays in acting by the other Party, or unavailability of materials related to the Manufacture of the Products (each cause, an event of "Force Majeure"). The affected Party shall give notice to the other Party in writing as soon as reasonably practical but no later than [***] after the occurrence of the event of Force Majeure, specifying the nature and extent of the event of Force Majeure, its anticipated duration and any 74

Source: REVOLUTION MEDICINES, INC., S-1, 1/17/2020





action being taken to avoid or minimize its effect. The suspension of performance allowed hereunder shall be of no greater scope and no longer duration than is reasonably required, and the affected Party shall promptly undertake and continue diligently all reasonable efforts necessary to cure such force majeure circumstances or to perform its obligations in spite of the ongoing circumstances. In the event that RevMed is the non-performing Party and the Force Majeure continues for more than [***] (which period, in its entirety or a portion thereof, is prior to the commencement of the Registration Program for a Product, which Development thereof is impacted by such Force Majeure), Sanofi's payment obligations under Article IX shall be suspended until notification by RevMed to Sanofi of the termination of such Force Majeure Event (and any related triggers and deadlines shall be similarly suspended).

15.2 Assignment; Change of Control.

(a) Neither Party may assign this Agreement or any of its rights or obligations hereunder, except as expressly permitted hereunder, or delegate any of its obligations under this Agreement, whether by operation of law or otherwise, in whole or in part, without the consent of the other Party, except as follows:

(i) Sanofi may, without consent of RevMed, assign this Agreement or its rights and obligations hereunder in whole or in part to any Affiliate of Sanofi, and RevMed may, with the consent of Sanofi (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), assign this Agreement or its rights and obligations hereunder in whole or in part to any Affiliate of RevMed; and

(ii) Either Party may, without consent of the other Party, assign this Agreement in whole to (i) in the case of RevMed, its successor in interest or assignee or purchaser, as applicable, in the case of a Change of Control or (ii) in the case of Sanofi, its successor in interest or assignee or purchaser, as applicable, in connection with the sale of all or substantially all of its assets to which this Agreement relates, or in connection with a merger, acquisition or similar transaction. In the case of Sanofi the intellectual property owned or controlled by any such successor in interest or assignee or purchaser (such successor in interest or assignee or purchaser, as applicable, an "Acquiror") or its Acquiror Family prior to the applicable Change of Control or other similar transaction immediately prior to such acquisition (other than as a result of a license from the acquired Party) or thereafter developed outside the scope of this Agreement in accordance with this Agreement shall be excluded from [***] and the Acquiror Family shall be excluded from "Affiliate" solely for purposes of the applicable components of the intellectual property definitions set forth herein. In the case of RevMed, the intellectual property owned or controlled by any such Acquiror or its Acquiror Family prior to the applicable Change of Control or other similar transaction immediately prior to such acquisition (other than as a result of a license from the acquired Party) or is thereafter developed outside the scope of this Agreement in accordance with this Agreement shall be excluded from the RevMed Licensed Technology, in each case only for so long as the remainder of the conditions of this Section 15.2 are met, and the Acquiror Family shall be excluded from "Affiliate" solely for purposes of the applicable components of the intellectual property definitions set forth herein, in all such cases if and only if: (A) the acquired Party remains a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Acquiror; (B) all intellectual property of the Acquired Party Family and 75

Source: REVOLUTION MEDICINES, INC., S-1, 1/17/2020





all research and development assets and operations of the Acquired Party Family, in each case relating to SHP2 Inhibitors and Products, remain with the Acquired Party Family and are not licensed or otherwise transferred to the Acquiror Party Family for any purpose; (C) the scientific and Development activities with respect to SHP2 Inhibitors and Products of the Acquired Party Family and Competing Products of the Acquiror Family (if any) are maintained separate and distinct, and (D) there is no exchange of Know-How relating to SHP2 Inhibitors and Products between the Acquired Party Family and the Acquiror Family. Any attempted assignment not in accordance with this Section 15.2 shall be null and void and of no legal effect. Any permitted assignee shall assume all assigned obligations of its assignor under this Agreement. The terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall inure to the benefit of, the Parties and their respected successors and permitted assigns. For clarity, any assignment by Sanofi shall be subject to Section 9.7(a).

(b) Except as part of a transaction permitted under this Section 15.2, in no event shall RevMed assign or transfer, or agree to assign or transfer to any Third Party, any or all of the RevMed Licensed Patents without the consent of Sanofi, not be unreasonably withheld or conditioned.

15.3 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any present or future law and if the rights or obligations of either Party under this Agreement will not be materially and adversely affected thereby, (i) such provision shall be fully severable, (ii) this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof, (iii) the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall not be affected by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision or by its severance here from and (iv) in lieu of such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision, there shall be added automatically as a part of this Agreement a legal, valid and enforceable provision as similar in terms to such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision as may be possible and reasonably acceptable to the Parties. To the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, each Party hereby waives any provision of law that would render any provision hereof illegal, invalid or unenforceable in any respect.

(f) The arbitrators are not empowered to award punitive or exemplary damages, and the Parties waive any right to recover any such damages.

(g) Unless the Parties otherwise agree in writing, during the period of time that any arbitration proceeding is pending under this Agreement, (i) the Parties shall continue to comply with all those terms and provisions of this Agreement that are not the subject of the pending arbitration proceeding; and (ii) in the event that the subject of the dispute relates to the exercise by a Party of a termination right hereunder, including in the case of a material breach of this Agreement, the effectiveness of such termination shall be stayed until the conclusion of the proceedings under this Section 15.6.
