Section 5.03 Indemnification.  Notwithstanding any provision of the Source Code              -----------------                                                  License, ETI shall not be required to honour any product warranty or intellectual property indemnity set forth in the Source Code License, to the extent that such breach of warranty or indemnity relates to a defect in any of the Entrust Products as of the Effective Date or the infringement or misappropriation of any third party rights incorporated into the Entrust Products as of the Effective Date.

    (i)   the designs, specifications and working drawings for the manufacture            of such Licensed Products are furnished by Grantee; and

   (ii)   such designs, specifications and working drawings are in sufficient           detail that no additional design by the manufacturer is required other           than adaptation to the production processes and standards normally           used by the manufacturer which change the characteristics of the           products only to a negligible extent;

                                       6

  (c) to make and have made, to use and have used, and to maintain machines,     tools, materials and other manufacturing instrumentalities, and to use and     have used methods and processes, insofar as such machines, tools, materials,     other manufacturing instrumentalities, methods and processes are involved in     or incidental to the development, manufacture, installation, testing,     maintenance or repair of Licensed Products, or to the training of personnel     in the use of such Licensed Products; provided, however, that the rights     granted in this Section 6.03(c) shall not serve to enlarge the scope of the     rights granted in Section 6.03(b);

Section 6.04. Limitations to Patent Licenses.  Nothing contained in a Patent               --------------------------------                               License shall be construed as:

    (a) requiring the filing of any application for a Patent or utility model,





or the prosecution, maintenance or defense of any such application;

    (b) the maintenance or defense of any Patent;

    (c) a warranty or representation by Grantor, or admission by Grantee, as to the validity or scope of any Patent;

Section 6.06 NTL Right to Cross-License.  The licenses granted hereunder do not              ---------------------------                                        include for the Grantee the right to grant sublicenses to any third party except as expressly provide in Section 6.03.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, NTL shall be entitled to sublicense the Entrust Patents to meet its obligations under its existing Patent cross license agreements.  For so long as ETI is an NTL Subsidiary, NTL shall also be entitled, as part of its continuing Patent cross licensing program, to sublicense Entrust Patents under new Patent cross license agreements provided that the rights granted in the Entrust Patents pursuant to any such new Patent cross license agreements do not materially exceed those rights customarily granted under NTL's existing Patent cross license agreements (as of the Effective Date) and ETI obtains the benefit of all Nortel Patents involved.

Section 6.07. Excluded Patents.               -----------------

(a) Assigned Patents.

The resulting inability of Grantor     to grant the licenses purported to be granted by it under such Patents shall     not be considered to be a breach of the Patent License.  In such case, upon     request by the Grantee, Grantor shall make reasonable efforts to secure     rights and licenses for the Grantee from the third-party equivalent to those     provided in the Patent License.

(b) Patents Subject to Exclusive Licenses.  ETI acknowledges that NTL may have     --------------------------------------                                         entered into exclusive license arrangements with other corporations or legal     entities.
