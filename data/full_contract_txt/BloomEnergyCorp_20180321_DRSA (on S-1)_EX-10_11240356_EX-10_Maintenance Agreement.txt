Operator shall be under no obligation to provide or perform services hereunder for any Bloom System whose Service Fee has not been paid in full for the then-current warranty year.

(b) In connection with Facility Services for the BOF, Operator shall provide all required labor but shall charge Owner for, and Owner shall reimburse Operator for, the cost of all required spare parts. Billing for such spare parts shall be done in the same manner as Services Fees, as set forth in Section 2.3(a).

Section 2.4 Facility Services Warranty. During the Warranty Period, Operator shall perform the services to the Bloom Systems and the BOF necessary for the Portfolio to perform to the Warranty Specifications (the "System Service Warranty"). In the event that Owner desires Operator to service the Bloom Systems and the BOF beyond the Warranty Period, the rate for such time-based services will be quoted by Operator to Owner quarterly for the following quarter, and materials will be invoiced at the retail prices for such materials.

Section 2.5 Facility Service Warranty Claims.

(a) If Owner desires to make a Facility Service Warranty claim during the Warranty Period, Owner must notify Operator of the defect or other basis for the claim in writing.

(b) In the case of a claim relating to the Power Performance Warranty for a One-Month Power Performance Period or the Efficiency Warranty, upon receipt of such notice and verification by Operator that such One-Month Power Performance Warranty or Efficiency Warranty is applicable, Operator (or its designated subcontractor) or the Service Provider (or its designated subcontractor) will promptly repair or replace, at Operator's sole option and discretion, any Bloom System whose repair or replacement is required in order for the Portfolio to perform consistent with the Power Performance Warranty or the Efficiency Warranty, as applicable. Owner is hereby notified that refurbished parts may be used in repair or replacement, 13

but any such refurbished parts will have passed the same inspections and tests performed by Operator on its new parts of the same type before such refurbished parts are used in any repair. If such repair or replacement is not possible (as determined at Operator's sole option and discretion), Operator will refund the Purchase Price of any such Bloom System to Owner notwithstanding Section 7.1. in which case Operator shall be deemed to have taken title to such Bloom System, and such Bloom System shall be deemed to no longer constitute a portion of the Portfolio. Operator shall make such determination as promptly as practicable, but in any event within 90 days of Operator's receipt of notice of the claim unless the specific nature of the problem requires a longer period in which to make such determination. If it is determined that a Bloom System will be removed pursuant to this Section 2.5. Operator shall at its sole cost and expense remove the Bloom System and any other ancillary equipment (including the concrete pad and any other improvements to the Site to extent required under the Site Lease) from the Site, restoring the Site to its condition before the installation, including closing all utility connections in the manner required by all applicable Legal Requirement and Site Lease.

(c) In the case of a claim relating to the Power Performance Warranty for a One-Year Power Performance Warranty Period, upon receipt of such notice and verification that such One-Year Power Performance Warranty is applicable, Operator shall make a payment to Owner in an amount to be calculated pursuant to Section 2.6; provided that the cumulative aggregate amount of Operator's liability for all claims under this Section 2.5(c) shall not exceed [***] of the aggregate Purchase Price of all Bloom Systems in the Portfolio during the applicable period and the purchase price under the December 30 Bill of Sale (inclusive of any amounts paid or for which a pending claim has been made under the Power Performance Warranty or the Section 8.2(b) Warranty, as applicable, under the MESPA).

Section 2.6 Power Performance Warranty. During the Warranty Period, Operator shall determine (i) for each full calendar month (the "One- Month Power Performance Warranty Period") within five (5) Business Days after the end of such month and (ii) for the most recent Look Back Period (the "One-Year Power Performance Warranty Period", and, together with the One-Month Power Performance Warranty Period, each a "Power Performance Warranty Period"), whether the Bloom Systems in the Portfolio during such Power Performance Warranty Period have delivered to the Interconnection Point the Minimum kWh during such Power Performance Warranty Period (the "Power Performance Warranty"). If such Power Performance Warranty calculation indicates that the Actual kWh of the Bloom Systems was less than the Minimum kWh during such Power Performance Warranty Period, then Operator shall so notify Owner in writing of the basis of its determination and Owner may make a claim under Section 2.5. An example of a Power Performance Warranty calculation for purposes of a Section 2.5 claim is attached as Appendix D.

Section 2.7 Efficiency Warranty. During the Warranty Period, Operator shall determine for each full calendar month (the "Efficiency Warranty Period") within five (5) Business Days after the end of such month whether the Portfolio has performed at the Minimum Efficiency Level (the "Efficiency Warranty"); provided that the Efficiency Bank shall be utilized to the extent necessary to meet the Efficiency Warranty. If the Minimum Efficiency Level has [***] Confidential Treatment Requested 14

not been met during such Efficiency Warranty Period, then Operator shall so notify Owner in writing of the basis of its determination and Owner may make a claim under Section 2.5. An example of an Efficiency Warranty calculation for purposes of a Section 2.5 claim is attached as Appendix E.

Section 2.8 Gas Payment Shortfall. During the Warranty Period, Operator shall perform such services on the Bloom Systems as shall cause the Efficiency Bank to maintain a positive balance at all times. If the Efficiency Bank reaches a balance of less than zero during the Warranty Period, Operator shall reimburse Owner for any Gas Payment Shortfall that Owner incurs within ten (10) days after Owner provides notice to Operator of such shortfall amount; provided that Operator's cumulative aggregate liability under this Section 2.8 plus any payments required to be made by Operator under Section 2.5(c) shall not exceed an amount equal to (i) one hundred percent (100%) of the aggregate Purchase Price of all Bloom Systems in the Portfolio during the applicable period and the purchase price under the December 30 Bill of Sale (inclusive of any amounts paid or for which a pending claim has been made for under the Gas Payment Shortfall under the MESPA), less (ii) the aggregate of all amounts paid by Operator (or claimed against Operator in the case of any claims that are pending at the time of such calculation) with respect to claims under Section 2.5(c) hereunder or Sections 8.2(b) and 8.3(c) of the MESPA. An example of a Gas Payment Shortfall calculation for purposes of a Section 2.8 claim is attached as Appendix F.

Section 2.9 Exclusions. The Facility Service Warranty shall not cover any obligations on the part of Operator caused by or arising from (a) Owner's (as opposed to Operator, Operator's Affiliate, the Service Provider or subcontractor acting as operator under this Agreement) failure to properly protect the Bloom Systems from vandalism or other third-party's actions or omissions, (b) Owner's (as opposed to Operator, Operator's Affiliate, the Service Provider or subcontractor acting as operator under this Agreement) failure to use the specified input fuel; (c) Owner's (as opposed to Operator, Operator's Affiliate, the Service Provider or subcontractor acting as operator under this Agreement) removal of any safety devices, (d) any conditions caused by unforeseeable movement in the environment in which the Bloom Systems are installed, (e) accidents, abuse, neglect, improper third party testing, vandalism, Force Majeure Events or acts of third parties, (f) DPL's failure to comply with Operator's gas delivery, quality or pressure requirements, (g) installation, operation, repair or modification of the Bloom Systems by anyone other than Operator or (h) any defect in construction materials or workmanship of the BOF or any deficiency in design of the BOF by BE, provided that the exclusions in this clause (h) shall not extend to any Portfolio Warranty claim to the extent caused by or arising from (A) any defect in construction materials or workmanship of the BOF or (B) any deficiency in design of the BOF by BE, in each case during the period while either the Section 8.2(b) Warranty or the warranty under Section 2.5(c) is in effect. OPERATOR SHALL HAVE NO OBLIGATION UNDER THE FACILITY SERVICE WARRANTY AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATION AS TO FACILITIES WHICH HAVE BEEN OPENED OR MODIFIED BY OWNER OR ANYONE OTHER THAN OPERATOR, OPERATOR'S AFFILIATE, THE SERVICE PROVIDER OR SUBCONTRACTOR, ACTING AS OPERATOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, ANY PERSON ACTING AS AN OPERATOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT (OR ANY SUCCESSOR AGREEMENT TO THIS AGREEMENT) OR ANY OF SUCH PERSON'S REPRESENTATIVES. 15

Source: BLOOM ENERGY CORP, DRS/A (on S-1), 3/21/2018





Operator shall have no obligation to indemnify Owner for any negligence, fraud or willful misconduct of any Owner Indemnitee, the breach by Owner of its covenants and warranties under this Agreement or the inability to utilize any tax benefits (for the avoidance of doubt, the Grant is not considered a tax benefit).

Section 6.3 Indemnity Claims Procedure. If any indemnifiable claim is brought against a Party (the "Indemnified Party"), then the other Party (the "Indemnifying Party") shall be entitled to participate in, and, unless in the opinion of counsel for the Indemnifying Party a conflict of interest between the Parties may exist with respect to such claim, assume the defense of such claim, with counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense of the Indemnified Party, or if a conflict precludes the Indemnifying Party from assuming the defense, then the Indemnifying Party shall reimburse the Indemnified Party on a monthly basis for the Indemnified Party's defense through separate counsel of the Indemnified Party's choice. Even if the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of the Indemnified Party with acceptable counsel, the Indemnifying Party, at its sole option, may participate in the defense, at its own expense, with counsel of its own choice without relieving the Indemnifying Party of any of its obligations hereunder.

Section 6.4 No Duplication of Claims. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Parties acknowledge and agree that no claiming or indemnified party shall be entitled to a double recovery under the indemnification provisions of this Agreement and the indemnification provisions of the MESPA.
