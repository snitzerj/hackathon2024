In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the contrary; (ii) the indemnifying party has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party; (iii) the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the indemnifying party; or (iv) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interest between them. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened action in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party unless such settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on any claims that are the subject matter of such action and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of an indemnified party.   (d) Contribution. If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsections (a), (b) or (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in subsections (a), (b) or (c) above (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Transaction Entities on the one hand and by the Agent on the other hand from the offering of the Offered Shares or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Agent, on the other, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Transaction Entities on the one hand and by the Agent on the other hand shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Agent. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Agent and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the first sentence of this Section 8(d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim which is the subject of this Section 8(d). Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8(d), the Agent shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the  Series A Preferred Stock sold pursuant to this Agreement exceeds the amount of any damages which the Agent has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

  9. Termination of Agency. If the Offered Shares are not sold by May 26, 2016, this Agreement will terminate without liability on the part of the Company and the Agent, except as provided in Section 10 hereof. As used in this Agreement, the term "Agent" includes any person substituted for the Agent under this Section 9.   10. Survival of Certain Representations and Obligations. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Transaction Entities, the Manager or their respective officers and of the Agent set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation, or statement as to the results thereof, made by or on behalf of the Agent, the Transaction Entities, the Manager or any of their respective representatives, officers or directors or any controlling person, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Offered Shares. If the settlement of the Offered Shares by the Agent is not consummated for any reason other than solely because of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9 hereof, the Company will reimburse the Agent for all out-of-pocket expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel) reasonably incurred by them in connection with the placement of the Offered Shares, and the respective obligations of the Transaction Entities and the Manager, on the one hand, and the Agent, on the other hand, pursuant to Section 8 hereof shall remain in effect. In addition, if the Offered Shares have been settled pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, the representations and warranties in Sections 2 through 3 and all obligations under Section 5 shall also remain in effect.

The Transaction Entities and the Manager have been advised that the Agent and its affiliates are engaged in a broad range of transactions which may involve interests that differ from those of the Transaction Entities and the Manager, and that the Agent has no obligation to disclose such interests and transactions to Transaction Entities and the Manager by virtue of any fiduciary, advisory or agency relationship; and   (d) Waiver. Each of the Transaction Entities and the Manager waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any claims they may have against the Agent for breach of fiduciary duty or alleged breach of fiduciary duty and agree that the Agent shall have no liability (whether direct or indirect) to either of the Transaction Entities or the Manager in respect of such a fiduciary duty claim or to any person asserting a fiduciary duty claim on behalf of or in right of the Transaction Entities or the Manager, including stockholders, holders of membership interests, employees or creditors of the Transaction Entities or the Manager.   17.
