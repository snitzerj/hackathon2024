Commencing on the Launch Date, each of Exact and Pfizer shall implement the sales Detailing plan set forth in the applicable Annual Marketing Plan and the Sales Deployment Plan. In the case of Pfizer, Pfizer shall ensure that (i) the number of Details in a Calendar Year by Pfizer Sales Representatives is not less than six hundred twenty-five thousand (625,000) Details (for the remainder of 2018 Calendar Year following the Launch Date, Pfizer shall deliver one hundred forty thousand (140,000) Details) and (ii) if the Product is Promoted by Pfizer Sales Representatives (A) in position 2 or higher, the Incentive Compensation weighting directly tied to the Product shall not be less than thirty percent (30%) of Incentive Compensation available to be earned by such Sales Representative in the applicable Calendar Quarter and (B) in position 3 or lower, the Incentive Compensation weighting directly tied to the Product shall not be less than twenty-five percent (25%) of Incentive Compensation available to be earned by such Sales Representative in the applicable Calendar Quarter. If Pfizer delivers less than five hundred sixty-two thousand five hundred (562,500) Details in a Calendar Year, then the Promotion Fee due Pfizer for such Calendar Year shall be reduced by the applicable percentage set forth in the table on Exhibit 3.4(a), with such reduction to be deducted from remittance of the Promotion Fee for the last Calendar Quarter of such Calendar Year; provided that if such deduction exceeds the amount payable for such Calendar Quarter then Exact shall apply any such remaining deduction to the Promotion Fee for the next Calendar Quarter or Calendar Quarters, as necessary until the total deduction has been applied. If Pfizer delivers less than four hundred fifty thousand (450,000) Details in a Calendar Year, in addition to percentage reduction of the Promotion Fee set forth in the table on Exhibit 3.4(a), Exact shall have the right to terminate this Agreement under Section 8.3(b), which termination shall not be subject to the right of Pfizer to cure such breach. In no event shall Pfizer owe any monies to Exact for Detail shortfalls under this Agreement other than to refund the Promotion Fee owed to Exact due to Detail shortfall in accordance with this Section 3.4(a). Each Party shall be responsible for its own Sales Representatives costs attributable to the Product, including base salary and Incentive Compensation, normal travel and entertainment expenses, cost of fleet vehicles and other expenses normally associated with Promotion of products and services similar to the Product. (b) Detailing Efforts and Costs. Each Party shall have sole and exclusive control of all Detailing efforts and activities by its Sales Representative and Representatives, and shall be solely responsible for the costs thereof.

Annual Marketing Plan, any Detailing costs incurred by a Party or its Affiliates in delivering the Details assigned to such Party shall be the sole responsibility of such Party or Affiliate and shall not be a Baseline M&P Expense or Shared M&P Expense or otherwise a shared cost pursuant to this Agreement. (c) IDN Promotion. As part of this Agreement, Pfizer agrees to deploy its IDN Key Account Managers (or successor team with similar responsibilities, the "KAM Team") to support understanding and uptake of the Product by IDN customers in accordance with the Annual Marketing Plan. In furtherance, prior to the beginning of each Calendar Year, Pfizer shall discuss and agree with Exact on the defined goals and key performance indicators for the KAM Team.

Pfizer shall make financial investment in Marketing and Promoting the Product in accordance with and in all cases subject to the budget in the applicable Annual Marketing Plan (as the same may be adjusted as provided in Section 3.3) and shall be equal to fifty percent (50%) of Shared M&P Expense, in the amounts set forth in the chart below. Pfizer, at its own expense, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to carry out Pfizer's responsibilities under the Annual Marketing Plan, which commercially reasonable efforts shall include committing the appropriate resources to assist in the implementation of the Annual Marketing Plan and to carry out the activities Pfizer is responsible for thereunder and hereunder. Pfizer will make investments as set forth in the chart below. Notwithstanding the above, Pfizer agrees to invest its portion of Shared M&P Expense each Calendar Year subject to, (a) Exact spending at least twelve million dollars ($12,000,000) in Baseline M&P Expense each Calendar Quarter (provided, that notwithstanding Exact's quarterly spend for Baseline M&P Expense, Exact shall spend a total of eighty million dollars ($80,000,000) in Baseline M&P Expense each Calendar Year measured as of the end of each Calendar Year), (b) an amount equal to the total Shared M&P Expense contributed by both Parties is used for Marketing and Promotion and (c) a total sum of not less than eighty million dollars ($80,000,000) of Baseline M&P Expense is used for Marketing and Promotional activities, including the costs of Exact Sponsorships and Related Activities; provided, however, the Parties may agree to reallocate Shared M&P Expenses by 28

mutual written consent. Pfizer agrees to match dollar for dollar Exact's Shared M&P Expense for a Calendar Year to up to the amounts specified in the chart below. Calendar Year Pfizer's Shared M&P Expense 2018 $24 million 2019 $22 million 2020 $21 million 2021 $20 million For any investment period less than a full Calendar Year (other than 2018), Pfizer's Shared M&P Expense investment shall be adjusted pro rata based on the number of months remaining until the end of the Calendar Year. For Calendar Year 2018, Pfizer's Shared M&P Expense shall be adjusted to equal the number of months remaining from the Launch Date to December 31, 2018 divided by twelve (12) multiplied by twenty-four million dollars ($24,000,000); provided the requirements of this Section 3.5 are satisfied. Pfizer shall have no obligation to incur Shared M&P Expenses in excess of the amount in the above chart for the given Calendar Year, unless the Parties mutually agree to increase their portion of the Shared M&P Expense. 3.6 Exact Investment and Support. Exact shall commit, at its sole cost and expense and not subject to reimbursement by Pfizer, to maintaining its originally planned out-of-pocket Marketing and Promotional spends of eighty million dollars ($80,000,000) in each of the 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 Calendar Years, including the Exact Sponsorships and Related Activities (the "Baseline M&P Expense"). In addition to Baseline M&P Expense, Exact shall invest Shared M&P Expense in amounts to be matched by Pfizer pursuant to Section 3.5 above. Exact, at its own expense, shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to carry out Exact's responsibilities under the Annual Marketing Plan, which commercially reasonable efforts shall include committing the appropriate resources to assist in the implementation of the Annual Marketing Plan and to carry out the activities Exact is responsible for thereunder. In addition, except as provided for in Section 3.2(d), Exact shall be responsible for contracting with agencies and vendors who are or will be providing services (including the development of Promotional Materials and Training Materials) associated with the execution of the Annual Marketing Plan, shall timely pay all amounts due to such agencies and vendors for such services and shall authorize Pfizer to interact directly with and instruct such agencies and vendors in connection with such services as necessary and appropriate under this Agreement.

For any investment period less than a full Calendar Year (other than 2018), Exact's Baseline M&P Expense and Shared M&P Expense investment shall be adjusted pro rata based on the number of months remaining until the end of the Calendar Year. For Calendar Year 2018, Exact's Baseline M&P Expense and Shared M&P Expense shall be adjusted to equal the number of months remaining from the Launch Date to December 31, 2018 divided by twelve (12) multiplied by eighty million dollars ($80,000,000) or twenty-four million dollars ($24,000,000), as applicable; provided that the requirements of this Section 3.6 are satisfied. Exact shall have no obligation to incur Shared M&P Expenses in excess of the amount in the above chart for the given Calendar Year, unless the Parties each agree to increase their portion of the Shared M&P Expense. 3.7 Changes in Shared M&P Expenses. In the event the Parties agree to not implement or to discontinue implementation of a strategy or tactic included in any Annual Marketing Plan, the applicable Shared M&P Expense investment set forth above shall be either (a) adjusted if, during good faith discussions at the JSC, the Parties agree on the implementation of a substitute strategy or tactic in place of the strategy or tactic that was not implemented or was discontinued, which adjustment will reflect any difference in cost of such substitute strategy or tactic or (b) reduced by the amount(s) allocated in the applicable budget for such strategy or tactic under the applicable Annual Marketing Plan, if the Parties, during good faith discussions at the JSC, agree not to implement a substitute strategy or tactic in place of the strategy or tactic that was not implemented or which was discontinued. Any amount saved as result of this Section 3.7 shall be re-deployed to other expenses associated with the Marketing of the Product, unless otherwise determined by the JSC. 4. ACCOUNTING. 4.1 Responsibility for Shared M&P Expenses. (a) General. Shared M&P Expenses contributed by Exact and Pfizer pursuant to Sections 3.5 and 3.6 shall be used solely to fund activities pursuant to the Annual Marketing Plan. The Parties shall agree to Calendar Quarter phasing of Baseline M&P Expenses and Shared M&P Expenses for budgeting purposes. The Parties will spend amounts contributed to Baseline M&P Expenses and Shared M&P Expenses simultaneously throughout each Calendar Year, in a manner consistent with the approved budget set forth in the Annual Marketing Plan. Any Baseline M&P Expenses and Shared M&P Expenses budgeted but not spent in Calendar Quarter may be rolled over into the next Calendar Quarter. For the avoidance of doubt, Pfizer will match dollar for dollar Exact's Shared M&P Expense for a Calendar Year to up to the amounts set forth in Section 3.5. (b) Remainder of 2018. Promptly after the Effective Date, Exact shall discuss with Pfizer its planned Marketing and Promotional spend associated with the Product for the period beginning on the Effective Date and ending on December 31, 2018, so that Pfizer may understand and recommend 30

reallocation of all or any portion of such planned Marketing and Promotional spend associated with the Product. Budget phasing of 2018 pro-rated Baseline M&P Expenses and pro-rated Shared M&P Expenses shall be done on the Calendar Quarter basis. Exact agrees it shall spend at least eighty million dollars ($80,000,000) toward Marketing and Promotion (including any amounts spent between January 1, 2018 and the Effective Date) and the pro-rated Shared M&P Expense for 2018. (c) Reporting. Within fifteen (15) Business Days after the end of each month during the Term beginning with October, 2018, Exact shall provide to Pfizer a written report setting forth the amount of Baseline M&P Expenses and Shared M&P Expenses incurred and paid for by Exact during such month, which report shall also provide sufficient itemization and detail related to such expenses in order for Pfizer to confirm that such Baseline M&P Expenses and Shared M&P Expenses were incurred pursuant to the Annual Marketing Plan. Pfizer, within fifteen (15) Business Days after the end of each month during the Term, beginning with October, 2018, shall prepare and provide to Exact a written report setting forth the aggregate amount of Shared M&P Expenses incurred and paid for by Pfizer during such month, along with sufficient itemization and detail related to such expenses in order for Exact to confirm that such Shared M&P Expenses were incurred pursuant to the Annual Marketing Plan. 4.2 Promotion Fee. (a) Calculation of Promotion Fee. From the Launch Date and ending on the last day of the next Calendar Quarter and each subsequent Calendar Quarter during the Term, Exact shall owe Pfizer a service fee equal to fifty percent (50%) of the product of: Laboratory Service Revenue minus Baseline Laboratory Service Revenue ("Incremental Laboratory Service Revenue") for the Calendar Quarter multiplied by Gross Margin Percent for the Calendar Quarter (such product, the "Promotion Fee"). In no event shall the Gross Margin Percent used in the calculation of the Promotion Fee be less than sixty-eight percent (68%) or more than seventy-four percent (74%). The calculation of the Promotion Fee pursuant to this Section 4.2(a) is subject to Section 4.2(c) below. Promotion Fee(s) and all compensation paid by Exact to Pfizer under this Agreement, even where calculated as a percentage of sales, is intended to compensate Pfizer a fair market value for the entirety of services that Pfizer is providing to Exact hereunder. The formula for the calculation of the Promotion Fee is as follows: A = Laboratory Service Revenue B = Baseline Laboratory Service Revenue C = Gross Margin Percent Promotion Fee = 0.5 * (A-B) * C 31

(b) Baseline Laboratory Service Revenue. The chart below sets forth the Baseline Laboratory Service Revenue for the Product for each Calendar Year during the Term (the "Calendar Year Baseline Laboratory Service Revenue"). In the Annual Marketing Plan the appropriate Calendar Year Baseline Laboratory Service Revenue shall be allocated among each Calendar Quarter during such Calendar Year, taking into consideration seasonality or other sales demand variables. For 2018, the first Calendar Quarter shall be from the Launch Date to December 31, 2018 and the Calendar Year Baseline Laboratory Service Revenue allocated to that Calendar Quarter shall be $130 million.

Calendar Year Baseline Laboratory Service Revenue 2018 $441 million 2019 $622 million 2020 $861 million 2021 $1.191 billion (c) Supplemental Promotion Fee. (i) Subject to Pfizer's compliance with Sections 3.4(a)(i) and 3.4(a)(ii), (A) Exact shall pay Pfizer the amount, if any, by which the aggregate amount of the Promotion Fee incurred by Exact to Pfizer during the remainder of 2018 Calendar Year and 2019 Calendar Year (the "First Promotion Fee Period") is less than $37.5 million (the "First Supplemental Promotion Fee"), and (B) Exact shall pay Pfizer the amount, if any, by which the aggregate Promotion Fee incurred by Exact to Pfizer during each of Calendar Year 2020 and 2021 is less than $30 million ("Annual Supplemental Promotion Fee"), in each case to compensate Pfizer for the sales, Marketing and other performance provided by Pfizer under this Agreement. (ii) As of June 30 of each Calendar Year during the Term, Exact shall calculate a partial-period amount to be paid toward the potential First Supplemental Promotion Fee or the potential Annual Supplemental Promotion Fee, as the case may be. With regard to the First Supplemental Promotion Fee, the partial-period payment shall be equal to the amount by which the Promotion Fee for 2018, and the first six (6) months of Calendar Year 2019, is less than $22.5 million, and with regard to each Annual Supplemental Promotion Fee, the partial-period payment shall be equal to the amount by which the Promotion Fee for the six-month (6-month) period through June 30 is less than $15 million. (iii) As of December 31 of each Calendar Year during the Term, Exact shall calculate the First Supplemental Promotion Fee or the Annual Supplemental Promotion Fee, as the case may be, if any, for the entirety of the applicable period. Exact shall pay Pfizer the First 32

Supplemental Promotion Fee or the Annual Supplemental Promotion Fee, as the case may be, if any, less any partial-period payment made by Exact during the applicable period pursuant to Section 4.2(c)(ii). (iv) To the extent the amount of the Promotion Fee for the First Promotion Fee Period exceeds the First Supplemental Promotion Fee, Exact shall be entitled to a credit of such excess amount up to the amount of any partial-period payment made by Exact during such First Promotion Fee Period pursuant to Section 4.2(c)(ii), and Exact shall apply such credit toward the Promotion Fee payment due Pfizer for the fourth Calendar Quarter of 2019 (or due for subsequent Calendar Quarters until such credit is fully exhausted). To the extent the amount of the Promotion Fee for any Calendar Year after 2019 exceeds the Annual Supplemental Promotion Fee for such Calendar Year, Exact shall be entitled to a credit of such excess amount up to the amount of any partial-period payment made by Exact during such Calendar Year pursuant to Section 4.2(c)(ii), and Exact shall apply such credit toward the Promotion Fee payment due Pfizer for the fourth Calendar Quarter of such Calendar Year (or due for subsequent Calendar Quarters until such credit is fully exhausted). (v) Any amounts due under Sections 4.2(c)(i) and (ii) shall be payable within thirty (30) days after each of June 30 , and December 31  of each Calendar Year, beginning with June 30, 2019, as applicable. (d) OB/Gyn Sales. If Exact (i) grants OB/Gyn Commercial Rights to a Third Party in accordance with Section 3.1(c) or (ii) launches its own sales channel in the OB/Gyn Field (as applicable, the "Excluded Channel"), then the Laboratory Service Revenue used to perform the calculation set forth in Section 4.2(a) and to determine royalty payments pursuant to Section 8.7 shall exclude all Laboratory Service Revenue attributable to the Excluded Channel except a mutually agreed percentage of Laboratory Service Revenue during the applicable period attributable to such Excluded Channel (the "Included Revenue Percentage"); provided, that (A) such Included Revenue Percentage will reflect the anticipated relative contribution of the Parties with regard to the Excluded Channel after such launch, and (B) the Included Revenue Percentage shall not be less than the revenue percentage attributable to the OB/Gyn Field as of the date of such launch, calculated on the same basis that revenue from the OB/Gyn Field is calculated by Exact on the Effective Date. 4.3 Fee Statements and Payments. (a) Monthly and Quarterly Financial Deliverables. Exact shall on a monthly basis, not later than fifteen (15) Business Days after the end of the month, deliver to Pfizer a full suite of performance data, including Product Laboratory Services completed, average selling price per unit, Laboratory Service Revenue, rebates, net revenue and a detailed Cost of Sales schedule 33

Not later than fifteen (15) Business Days after the end of the Calendar Quarter, Exact shall deliver to Pfizer a rolling sales forecast and an estimate, for the remaining Calendar Quarters in the Calendar Year, of the Promotion Fee as set forth in Section 4.2. (b) Payment of Promotion Fee. Exact, within thirty (30) days after the end of each Calendar Quarter of the Term, shall deliver to Pfizer a consolidated report in the form of and containing the information necessary to confirm the calculation of the Promotion Fee for such Calendar Quarter, together with the underlying spreadsheets with respect to such Calendar Quarter. The Promotion Fee due with respect to such Calendar Quarter and reflected on the consolidated report shall be remitted at the time such report is made. 4.4 Taxes and Withholding. It is understood and agreed between the Parties that any payments made under this Agreement are exclusive of any value added or similar tax ("VAT"), and that no such VAT shall apply to the payments made under this Agreement. In the event any payments made pursuant to this Agreement become subject to withholding taxes under the laws or regulation of any jurisdiction, the Party making such payment shall deduct and withhold the amount of such taxes for the account of the payee to the extent required by Applicable Law and such amounts payable to the payee shall be reduced by the amount of taxes deducted and withheld. Any such withholding taxes required under Applicable Law to be paid or withheld shall be an expense of, and borne solely by, the payee. To the extent that the Party making a payment is required to deduct and withhold taxes on any payments under this Agreement, the Party making such payment shall pay the amounts of such taxes to the proper Governmental Authority in a timely manner and promptly transmit to the payee an official tax certificate or other evidence of such withholding sufficient to enable the payee to claim such payments of taxes. The payee shall provide any tax forms to the Party making such payment that may be reasonably necessary in order for such Party not to withhold tax or to withhold tax at a reduced rate under an applicable bilateral income tax treaty. The payee shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide any such tax forms to the Party making the payment at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date for any payments for which the payee desires that the Party making the payment apply a reduced withholding rate. Each Party shall provide the other with reasonable assistance to enable the recovery, as permitted by Law, of withholding taxes, VAT, or similar obligations resulting from payments made under this Agreement, such recovery to be for the benefit of the Party bearing such withholding tax or VAT. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (a) if an action (including any assignment or sublicense of its rights or obligations under this Agreement, or any failure to comply with Applicable Law or filing or record retention requirements) by a Party leads to the imposition of withholding tax liability or VAT on the other Party that would not have been imposed in the absence of such action or in an increase in such liability above the liability that would have been imposed in the absence of such action, then the sum payable by that Party (in respect of which such deduction or withholding is required to be made) shall be increased to the extent necessary to ensure that the other Party 34

receives a sum equal to the sum which it would have received had no such action occurred, (b) otherwise, the sum payable by that Party (in respect of which such deduction or withholding is required to be made) shall be made to the other Party after deduction of the amount required to be so deducted or withheld, which deducted or withheld amount shall be remitted in accordance with Applicable Law. 4.5 No Partnership Provision. It is expressly agreed that Pfizer and Exact shall be independent contractors and that the relationship between Pfizer and Exact shall not constitute a partnership, joint venture or agency. The Parties agree that the rights and obligations under this Agreement are not intended to constitute a partnership or similar arrangement that will require separate reporting for tax purposes consistent with the intent reflected in the foregoing sentence and agree that they shall not file any reports, documents or other item relating to taxes or state or acknowledge to any tax authority that such relationship is a partnership or similar arrangement unless required by Applicable Law. 4.6 Payments; Currency. All payments due by one Party to the other Party hereunder shall be paid by wire transfer in immediately available funds from the account or accounts of a Party and/or its Affiliates to an account or accounts of the receiving Party and/or its Affiliates designated in writing by the receiving Party. All amounts payable and calculations hereunder shall be in United States dollars. 4.7 Maintenance of Records; Audits. (a) Record Keeping. Each Party shall keep and shall cause its Affiliates to keep accurate books and accounts of record in connection with (i) its Marketing and Promotion of the Product, (ii) (with respect to Exact) performance of Product Laboratory Services, and (iii) its activities under this Agreement and any Annual Marketing Plan, in sufficient detail to permit accurate determination of all figures necessary for verification of (A) amounts to be paid hereunder and (B) compliance with the terms of this Agreement. Each Party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, maintain such records for a period of at least three (3) years after the end of the Calendar Year to which they pertain. (b) Financial Audits. (i) Audit Right. Upon thirty (30) days prior written notice from a Party (the "Auditing Party"), the other Party (the "Audited Party") shall permit an independent certified public accounting firm of nationally recognized standing selected by the Auditing Party and reasonably acceptable to the Audited Party, to examine, at the Auditing Party's sole expense, the relevant books and records of the Audited Party and its Affiliates as may be reasonably necessary to verify the accuracy of the reports submitted by the Audited Party in accordance with Sections 3.4(d), 4.1(c) and 4.3(a) and the payment of Promotion Fees hereunder.

No other information shall be provided to the Auditing Party. The decision of the accounting firm will be final and unappealable absent manifest error. (ii) Underpayments/Overpayments. If such accounting firm concludes that additional Promotion Fees were due to Pfizer, Exact shall pay to Pfizer an amount equal to the actual Promotion Fee due minus the Promotion Fee paid within thirty (30) days of the date Exact receives such accountant's written report so concluding. If such accounting firm correctly concludes that Promotion Fees paid to Pfizer were in excess of the amount properly due, Pfizer shall pay or refund to Exact an amount equal to the Promotion Fee paid minus the actual Promotion Fee due within thirty (30) days of the date Exact receives such accountant's written report so concluding.

Royalty payments shall be determined by multiplying the Laboratory Services Revenue and the applicable royalty rate from the chart below. Cumulative Incremental Laboratory Services Revenue during the Term Applicable Royalty Rate If < $200 million 0% If > $200 million and < $400 million 1% If > $400 million and < $600 million 2% If > $600 million 3% 49

Notwithstanding the above, Exact agrees to pay any financial commitment made by Pfizer pursuant to Section 3.2(d) and Exhibit 3.2(d) to Third Parties following the effective date of termination; provided that such amounts conform with the then-current Annual Marketing Plan, including the budget. (b) Exact shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide six (6) month notice prior to the expiry of the Term, or in the case of termination by Pfizer under Section 8.4, within the applicable notice period in advance of the effective date of such termination, that Exact intends for Pfizer to continue providing Advertising services for the Product pursuant to Section 3.2(d). Thereafter, the Parties will use good faith efforts to agree to the Advertising services that will be provided by Pfizer during the Tail Period in accordance with Section 3.2(d) and Exhibit 8.8(b). For clarity, Pfizer's obligation to provide Advertising services during the Tail Period is limited to the expiry of the Term or termination by Pfizer pursuant to Section 8.4, or termination by Exact pursuant to Section 8.3. (c) In the event Exact terminates this Agreement for cause pursuant to Section 8.3 or Pfizer terminates this Agreement without cause pursuant to Section 8.4, Exact shall not be obligated to pay Pfizer a supplemental Promotion Fee pursuant to Section 4.2(c) for the Calendar Year, or any portion of such Calendar Year in which such termination occurs. 8.9 Survival of Certain Obligations.

In any such event, this Agreement shall be construed as if such clause of portion thereof had never been contained in this Agreement, and there shall be deemed substituted therefor such provision as will most nearly carry out the intent of the Parties as expressed in this Agreement to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law. 9.9 Descriptive Headings.

Both Parties are independent contractors under this Agreement. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to create an employment, agency, joint venture or partnership relationship between the Parties hereto or any of their agents or employees, or any other legal arrangement that would impose liability upon one Party for the act or failure to act of the other Party. Neither Party shall have any express or implied power to enter into any contracts or commitments or to incur any liabilities in the name of, or on behalf of, the other Party, or to bind the other Party in any respect whatsoever.
