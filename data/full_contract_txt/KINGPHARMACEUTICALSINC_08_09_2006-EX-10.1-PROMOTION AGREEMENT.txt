In the event that a Depomed Supply Failure occurs, notwithstanding its compliance with its obligations under Section 6.1, to fulfill all orders for the Product generated by King activities in a timely and efficient manner, upon written notice to Depomed (a "King Manufacturing Notice"), King shall have, and hereby grants King, exercisable only in accordance with the provisions hereof, the right, but not the obligation, to manufacture, or have manufactured, the Product on behalf of Depomed, at Depomed's expense, including expenses related to the technical transfer of the Product, and Depomed will provide reasonable assistance to King in connection therewith, including by transferring or licensing to King all Technology necessary or useful to give King the capability of manufacturing the Product so that King can undertake manufacture of the Product; provided, however, that Depomed shall not be required to reimburse King for more than [***] percent ([***]%) of Depomed's standard cost for such Product.

Depomed agrees to consider in good faith any proposal by King to manufacture the 500mg formulation of the Product at King's Bristol facility that would result in a reduction in the supply price applicable to the Product relative to Depomed's then current contract manufacturer, and would be suitable to Depomed's operations, regulatory affairs, and quality assurance groups. Any fixed and determinable savings in Product manufacturing cost to Depomed realized during the Term, and during the eight calendar quarters during which a payment is being paid pursuant to Section 7.4, that results from any definitive long-term supply arrangement between Depomed and King relating to the Product relative to Depomed's then current long-term supply arrangement [***]; provided that, in the event King continues to manufacture the Product for Depomed, the parties will negotiate in good faith with respect to adjusting the pricing mechanism for the manufacture of such Product following the Term, and such eight calendar quarter period, in order to compensate King for such savings and for any discounts King provided to Depomed as a result of the relationship of the parties hereunder. Any manufacture by King of the Product would be subject to regulatory approval of a supplemental NDA providing for such manufacture.

The parties shall consider in their discussions any other customary manner of determining similar

(ii) If King does not perform, in the aggregate, two times the PDE Minimum in any two consecutive Agreement Quarters, Depomed may demand that King cure such default by (A) [***] and (B) [***], in each case, prior to the end of the next succeeding Agreement Quarter following notice from Depomed.

(iii) Upon the third failure by King to meet the PDE Minimum during any six consecutive Agreement Quarters, Depomed shall have the right to [***] or demand that King shall cure such default in the same manner outlined in clause (i) above for the first such default.

(b) If, as of the end of any period of the immediately previous four consecutive Agreement Quarters, Promotion Net Sales for such period are less than $[***], either party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement on 120 days' prior written notice to the other party, which notice may not be given before the third anniversary of the Promotion Commencement Date.

(c) If a party desires to exercise its option to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.2 or demand any [***] or cure pursuant to Section 8.2(a), it must give written notice to the other party within 60 days after receiving the report of the Agreement Quarter or Agreement Month giving rise to the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.2.

Section 8.3 Termination for Cause. Either party may terminate this Agreement, effective at any time after providing sixty days written notice and an opportunity to cure during such sixty day period (ninety days in the case of a breach by Depomed of Section 6.1), in the event of a material failure of the other party to comply with its material obligations contained in this Agreement. If such cure is effected, such notice with respect to such termination shall be null and void.

Section 8.4 Termination for Bankruptcy or Force Majeure. To the extent permitted by law, each party will have the right to terminate this Agreement immediately upon notice to the other party, in the event of either of the following:

Notwithstanding the occurrence of any of the event specified in subsection (a) of this Section 8.4, the parties acknowledge and agree that, to the extent Section 365(n) of the United States Bankruptcy Code applies to this Agreement, the non-insolvent party may elect to retain and exercise the rights granted to it hereunder with respect to the intellectual property owned or controlled by the insolvent party.

Section 8.5 Force Majeure. Any Force Majeure Event of the type described in Section 16.7 affecting a party hereunder shall entitle the other party hereto, at any time after the expiry of the period of six months specified therein and upon sixty days written notice given after such six month period (such notice being, null and void if the Force Majeure Event is discontinued during such sixty-day period), in addition to the right to terminate this Agreement under Section 8.4, the right to (i) extend this Agreement for a period equal to the duration of the Force Majeure Event which occasioned the delay, interruption or prevention (subject to the maximum term of six months) or (ii) continue the Agreement in full force and effect without modification. In no circumstances will either party be liable to the other for its inability to perform under this Agreement due to any such Force Majeure Event.

Section 8.6 Recall.

ARTICLE XIII

COMBINATION PRODUCTS; RIGHT OF FIRST NEGOTIATION

Section 13.1 Combination Products.

(a) Depomed agrees to grant and hereby grants to King an exclusive option (exercisable at King's sole discretion by providing written notice of intent at any time, but in no event later than 180 days after the Effective Date) to obtain an exclusive license in the Territory to certain of Depomed's proprietary drug delivery technology in combination with both metformin hydrochloride and any other active pharmaceutical ingredients (a "Combination Product License"). If King notifies Depomed in writing within 180 days after the Effective Date that King desires to exercise its option to obtain a Combination Product License, King and Depomed shall promptly commence good-faith negotiations regarding a definitive agreement providing for the Combination Product License, for a period of 60 days or such longer period as may be mutually agreed upon by the parties in writing; and it is agreed that, as part of such good faith negotiations, the parties will discuss, for inclusion in any definitive agreement, appropriate non-compete obligations for each party with respect to any product containing metformin hydrochloride as an active pharmaceutical ingredient. If Depomed and King fail to enter into such a definitive agreement during such period, then Depomed shall thereafter have the right to negotiate and enter into one or more agreements with Third Parties related to Depomed's proprietary drug delivery technology in combination with both metformin hydrochloride and other active pharmaceutical ingredients; provided that, for a period of 6 months, any such agreement may not be on terms and conditions materially more favorable to the Third Party than the terms and conditions last offered by King prior to the termination of discussions with Depomed.

(b) In the event the parties are not able to enter a definitive agreement with respect to a Combination Product License, pursuant to Section 13.1(a), then prior to the expiration or termination of this Agreement, except pursuant to this Agreement, (i) neither party, nor any

Person controlled by a party, will be entitled to commercially launch in the Territory (either directly or indirectly through a marketing partner) a product containing metformin as an active pharmaceutical ingredient, and (ii) no Affiliate of Depomed will be entitled to commercially launch in the Territory (either directly or indirectly through a marketing partner) a product that (A) contains metformin as an active pharmaceutical ingredient and (B) uses Depomed's or its Affiliate's proprietary drug delivery technology currently referred to as the AcuForm technology and described in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,340,475 and 6,635,280.

Section 13.2 Right of First Negotiation. Depomed shall notify King in writing in the event that Depomed desires to divest itself of its rights to the Product in the Territory (e.g., by asset sale or product license to a Third Party), or of its rights in the Territory to a product owned or controlled by Depomed containing metformin and another active pharmaceutical ingredient in combination with Depomed's proprietary drug delivery technology incorporated within the Product (currently referred to as the AcuForm technology) (a "Combination Product"). If King notifies Depomed in writing within 30 days after receipt of such notice (the "Evaluation Period") that King is not interested in obtaining all of Depomed's rights in and to the Product or the applicable Combination Product (such rights, "Metformin Product Rights"), or if King fails to notify Depomed of King's interest in obtaining the Metformin Product Rights, in either case prior to the expiration of the Evaluation Period, then Depomed shall have no further obligation to King under this Agreement with respect to the applicable Metformin Product Rights. If King is interested in obtaining the Metformin Product Rights, it shall so notify Depomed in writing prior to the expiration of the Evaluation Period, and upon Depomed's receipt of such notice King and Depomed shall promptly commence good-faith negotiations, for a period of 30 days and such longer period as may be mutually agreed upon by the parties in writing in the event the parties have made material progress in the negotiations (the "Negotiation Period"), regarding the commercially reasonable terms of an agreement pursuant to which King shall obtain the Metformin Product Rights. If Depomed and King fail to enter into an agreement for the Metformin Product Rights prior to the expiration of the Negotiation Period, then Depomed shall thereafter have the right to negotiate and enter into an agreement with a Third Party granting the Metformin Product Rights to a Third Party; provided that, for a period of 6 months, any such agreement may not be on terms and conditions materially more favorable to the Third Party than the terms and conditions last offered by King prior to the termination of discussions with Depomed. The provisions of this Section 13.2 shall not apply to, and Depomed shall have no obligation to King under this Section 13.2 in respect of, any acquisition of Depomed by a Third Party, any merger or consolidation with or involving Depomed, any acquisition by a Third Party of any material portion of the stock of Depomed, or any acquisition by a Third Party of a material portion of the assets of Depomed in addition to the Product or any Combination Product; provided that such Third Party must remain bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including this Section 13.2.

Section 16.1 Headings. The titles, headings or captions and paragraphs in this Agreement are for convenience only and do not define, limit, extend, explain or describe the scope or extent of this Agreement or any of its terms or conditions and therefore shall not be considered in the interpretation, construction or application of this Agreement.

Section 16.2 Severability. In the event that any of the provisions or a portion of any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction or a governmental authority, such provision or portion of provision will be construed and enforced as if it had been narrowly drawn so as not to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, and the validity, legality, and enforceability of the enforceable portion of any such provision and the remaining provisions will not be adversely affected thereby.

Section 16.3 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with the schedules and exhibits hereto and the Confidentiality Agreement, all of which are incorporated by reference, contains all of the terms agreed to by the parties regarding the subject matter hereof and supersedes any prior agreements, understandings, or arrangements between them, whether oral or in writing.

Section 16.4 Amendments. This Agreement may not be amended, modified, altered, or supplemented except by means of a written agreement or other instrument executed by both of the parties hereto. No course of conduct or dealing between the parties will act as a modification or waiver of any provisions of this Agreement.

Section 16.5 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original as against the party whose signature appears thereon, but all of which taken together will constitute but one and the same instrument.

Section 16.6 Waiver. The failure of either party to enforce or to exercise, at any time or for any period of time, any term of or any right arising pursuant to this Agreement does not constitute, and will not be construed as, a waiver of such term or right, and will in no way affect that party's right later to enforce or exercise such term or right.

accident, act of God, declared or undeclared wars, acts of terrorism, or compliance with or other action taken to carry out the intent or purpose of any law or regulation) (a "Force Majeure Event"), then such party shall have such additional time to perform as shall be reasonably necessary under the circumstances. In the event of such failure or delay, the affected party will use its diligent efforts, consistent with sound business judgment and to the extent permitted by law, to correct such failure or delay as expeditiously as possible. In the event that a party is unable to perform by a reason described in this Section 16.7, its obligation to perform under the affected provision of this Agreement shall be suspended during such time of nonperformance.

In the case of any such event, the affected party shall promptly, but in no event later than 10 days of its occurrence, notify the other party stating the nature of the condition, its anticipated duration and any action being taken to avoid or minimize its effect. Furthermore, the affected party shall keep the other party informed of the efforts to resume performance. After sixty (60) days of such inability to perform, the parties agree to meet and in good faith discuss how to proceed. In the event that the affected party is prevented from performing its obligations pursuant to this Section 16.7 for a period of six (6) months, the other party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to the provisions of Sections 8.4(b).

Section 16.13 Relationship Between Parties. The parties hereto are acting and performing as independent contractors, and nothing in this Agreement creates the relationship of partnership, joint venture, sales agency, or principal and agent. Neither party is the agent of the other, and neither party may hold itself out as such to any other party. All financial obligations associated with each party's business will be the sole responsibility of such party.
