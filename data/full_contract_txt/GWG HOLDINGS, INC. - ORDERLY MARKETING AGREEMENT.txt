1.3 [Reserved]. 1.4 The Seller Trusts and GWG intend to retain one or more nationally recognized bulge bracket investment banks (the "Bank") for the orderly marketing and resale of Shares pursuant to a separate engagement letter (the "Engagement Letter") to advise them in connection with the sale of the Tranches (together, the "Offerings"). Such Engagement Letter shall include customary representations, warranties, covenants and indemnification provisions. The services to be performed by the Bank shall be set forth in such Engagement Letter and are expected to include, among others: (a) assisting in the drafting and preparation of one or more prospectus supplements describing GWG, the Shares and the terms of the Offerings; (b) advising the Seller Trusts on a marketing and distribution strategy for each Tranche of Shares, including whether a particular Tranche should be sold through a block trade, overnight bookbuild, or similar transaction; (c) assisting GWG in preparing marketing materials and conducting one or more "roadshows" and meetings with potential purchasers of the Shares; (d) advising the Seller Trusts as to the timing, structure and pricing of the Offerings; (e) providing other advisory services as are customary for similar transactions. The Engagement Letter shall include a requirement that, prior to any distribution of Stock by the Bank as contemplated by this Agreement, the Bank shall consult with each of GWG and the Trust Advisors as to the strategy for the marketing, sale and distribution of the respective Tranche. 1.5 After the Parties have agreed on the strategy for the marketing, sale and distribution of a Tranche, the Seller Trusts shall offer the Bank the right to serve as the lead left joint-book-running manager in connection with a best efforts distribution. GWG shall be entitled to appoint, in its discretion, an additional bank as joint book-running manager to participate in the distribution. The Seller Trusts further agree that in the event the Bank accepts such role it will be paid customary fees for the performance of its services in connection with such transactions and that such engagement will involve the execution of a standard form agreement with respect to the distribution of each Tranche, which may be in the form of a placement agency agreement, underwriting agreement or other appropriate agreement (each, a "Distribution Agreement"); provided, however, that nothing contained in this OMA or Engagement Letter shall require the Bank to underwrite or purchase all or any portion of a Tranche of Stock for its own account. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that the Bank or its affiliates may, solely at its discretion and without any obligation to do so, purchase Stock in any Tranche as principal.

1.6 Each such Distribution Agreement shall set out the customary terms and conditions for the sale and distribution of the respective Tranche, including customary representations, warranties, covenants and indemnification provisions. For the avoidance of doubt, each Distribution Agreement shall include provisions to the following effect: (i) GWG shall have no responsibility for the payment of fees or commissions payable to the Bank, which fees and commissions shall be the responsibility of certain affiliates of the Seller Trusts as set forth in the applicable Distribution Agreement; and (ii) each of GWG and the Seller Trusts shall agree to provide a customary indemnity in favor of the Bank and its affiliates. 1.7 If, in connection with the marketing, sale and distribution of a Tranche, the Bank determines that the number of Shares of Stock proposed to be included in the Tranche exceeds the number that can reasonably be sold, then the number of Shares of Stock shall be reduced accordingly on a pro-rata basis with respect to each of the Seller Trusts. 1.8 Prior to the offering of each Tranche, GWG shall provide the placement agents or underwriters in such Offering a list of the top 100 institutional holders of the Common Stock. In connection with any Offering, the Seller Trusts shall instruct the placement agents or underwriters to use their reasonable best efforts to (i) effect as wide a distribution of the Shares as is reasonably practicable without adversely affecting the pricing thereof and (ii) not sell any Shares to any person or Group (as such terms is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")) who, upon completion of the Offering, would have Beneficial Ownership (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of shares of Common Stock representing in the aggregate 5.0% or more the total number of outstanding shares of Common Stock (or in the case of a person of the type described in Rule 13d-1(b)(1)(i) under the Exchange Act, 10% or more of the Total Voting Power). Section 2. Compensation. The Engagement Letter shall provide that the Bank shall not be entitled to any compensation for its advice hereunder or reimbursement of its expenses in connection with this OMA and shall only be entitled to compensation in connection with an Offering as provided in the Engagement Letter and related Distribution Agreement with respect to such Offering. Section 3. [Reserved] Section 4. General Provisions. 4.1 Term; Termination; Withdrawal of Bank. (a) This OMA shall expire upon the earlier of (i) the first anniversary of the Effective Date and (ii) the date that all Shares of Stock of the Seller Trusts as set forth on Schedule A hereto have been sold (the "Term"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, this OMA may be terminated with or without cause at any time after the Effective Date and without liability or continuing obligation by any of the Parties hereto (i) by mutual written agreement of all of the Parties; and (ii) in writing by the Trust Advisors in their sole discretion.

(b) The Engagement Letter shall provide that the Bank may terminate its engagement at any time upon not less than 45 days' prior written notice to the other Parties. In the event the Bank provides such notice at any time prior to the sale of greater than 50% of the Shares and within 12 months of the Effective Date, then GWG and the Trust Advisors may elect (A) to terminate this OMA or (B) to continue this OMA and to seek to appoint a substitute investment bank, in which case GWG, after consultation with the Trust Advisors, shall be entitled to appoint a substitute investment bank to serve as the lead joint-book-running manager for the sale of the Shares. In the event the Bank terminates the Engagement Letter at any time following the sale of greater than 50% of the Shares and within 12 months of the Effective Date, the termination thereof shall constitute a concurrent Termination of this OMA. 4.2 Amendments and Waivers. This OMA may be amended or modified in whole or in part, only by duly authorized agreement in writing executed by each of the Parties. 4.3 Notices. All notices and other communications among the Parties shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given (i) when delivered in person, (ii) when delivered after posting in the United States mail having been sent registered or certified mail return receipt requested, postage prepaid, (iii) when delivered by FedEx or other nationally recognized overnight delivery service or (iv) when received by facsimile or email (provided that a copy is subsequently delivered by one of the other methods permitted in (i) through (iii) of this Section 4.3), addressed as follows: If to GWG: 220 S.
