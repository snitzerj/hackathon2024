     ARTICLE VII  INDEMNIFICATION AND CONTRIBUTION     Section 7.01 The Company's Indemnification of the Contractor. The provisions of Exhibit A hereto, entitled "Responsibility of and  Indemnification by Agency" are hereby incorporated herein by reference.     Section 7.02 The Contractor's Indemnification of the Company. The provisions of Exhibit A hereto, entitled "Responsibility of and  Indemnification by Company" are hereby incorporated herein by reference.     Section 7.03 Intellectual Property Infringement. The Contractor agrees that it shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless, at its own  expense, all suits and claims against the Company and any officers, directors, employees and affiliates of the Company (collectively, the "Company  Indemnified Parties"), for infringement or violation of any patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret or other intellectual property rights of any third  party that relates to this Agreement or the Offering, or servicing of the Notes. The Contractor agrees that it shall pay all sums, including without  limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and other costs incurred by the Company, in defense of, by final judgment or decree, or in settlement of any  suit or claim asserted or assessed against, or incurred by, any of the Company Indemnified Parties on account of such infringement or violation,  provided that the Company Indemnified Parties involved shall cooperate in all reasonable respects with the Contractor and its attorneys in the  investigation, trial and defense of such lawsuit or action and any appeal arising therefrom; provided, however, that the Company Indemnified  Parties may, at their own cost, participate in the investigation, trial and defense of such lawsuit or action and any appeal arising therefrom. The  parties shall cooperate with each other in any notifications to insurers.     Section 7.04 Confidentiality. The parties to this Agreement acknowledge and agree that all information, whether oral or written,  concerning a disclosing party and its business operations, prospects and strategy, which is furnished by the disclosing party to the other party is  deemed to be confidential, restricted and proprietary to the disclosing party (the "Proprietary Information"). Proprietary Information supplied shall  not be disclosed, used or reproduced in any form except as required to accomplish the intent of, and in accordance with the terms of, this  Agreement and the Indenture. The receiving party shall provide the same care to avoid disclosure or unauthorized use of Proprietary Information  as it provides to protect its own proprietary information, including without limitation retaining Proprietary Information in a secure place with limited  access, but in no event shall the receiving party fail to use reasonable care under the circumstances to avoid disclosure or unauthorized use of  Proprietary Information. Unless otherwise specified in writing, all Proprietary Information shall (i) remain the property of the disclosing party, (ii) be  used by the receiving party only for the purpose for which it was intended under this Agreement and the Indenture, and (iii) together with all  copies of such information, be returned to the disclosing party or destroyed upon request of the disclosing party, and, in any event, upon  termination of this Agreement, except as otherwise provided or contemplated by this Agreement, including Sections 3.02(b) and (e) and 8.05  hereof. Proprietary Information does not include information which is: (a) published or included as disclosure within the Registration Statement or  otherwise available in the public domain through no fault of the receiving party; (b) lawfully received from a third party having rights in the  information without     16





     restriction of the third party's right to disseminate the information and without notice of any restriction against its further disclosure; or (c)  produced under order of a court of competent jurisdiction or other similar requirement of a governmental agency or authority, so long as the party  required to disclose the information provides the other party with prior notice of such order or requirement and its cooperation to the extent  reasonable in preserving its confidentiality. Because damages may be difficult to ascertain, and without limiting any other rights and remedies  specified herein, an injunction may be sought against the party who has breached or threatened to breach this Section.

Anything to the contrary notwithstanding, the termination of this  Agreement shall not prevent the Company from commencing or cause the Company to terminate the Offering.
