                              PROMOTION AGREEMENT

This Promotion Agreement (the "Agreement") is dated as of January 26, 1998 between CNET, Inc. ("CNET") and Cyberian Outpost, Inc. (the "Company"). Pursuant to this Agreement, CNET will provide various links and other online and television promotions (collectively, the "Promotions") to the Company to assist the Company in promoting its products and services and facilitating the sale of products to potential buyers through its Internet site. CNET will be compensated by the Company for providing the Promotions. Accordingly, the parties hereby agree as follows:

1.   Background.

     1.1  The Company. The Company operates an electronic retailing operation           through its Internet sites located at www.cyberianoutpost.com or           www.outpost.com (together with any successors to such sites, the           "Company Site"). Through the Company Site, the Company sells or           facilitates the sale of various products and services, either directly           or as an agent for third party vendors. All products and services           offered for sale through the Company Site are referred to as the           "Products."

     1.2  CNET. CNET produces television programs and operates a network of           Internet sites on the world wide web. For purposes of this Agreement,           the "CNET Sites" refer to any Internet sites operated by CNET or its           subsidiaries, including without limitation the sites referenced in           Section 2.5 and Exhibit A.

2.   CNET's Obligations.

     2.1  TV Promotions. CNET will provide the Company one 15 second "spot" for           Promotions on its syndicated weekly TV program, TV.COM. Promotions           will run on each weekly episode of TV.COM during the Term; provided           that TV.COM remains on the air throughout such period. Should TV.COM           not be run on the air during a portion of the Term, CNET will run two           download.com banner advertising programs per month during such portion           of the Term in lieu of the foregoing TV.COM Promotions.

     2.2  Banner Promotions. CNET will provide advertising banners to the           Company during the Term as described in Exhibit A.

     2.3  Retail Promotions.

            2.3.1  CNET will provide for various retail Promotions across the CNET                  Sites, which may include text/HTML links, buttons, portals and                  other fixed Promotions that include embedded links to the                  Company Site (the "Retail Promotions" and, together with the                  advertising banners contemplated in the preceding paragraph,                  the "Online Promotions").

          2.3.2  Subject to Section 4 below, CNET will provide the Company with                  a total of at least (a) [XXXXXX] Retail Impressions during                  the first three months of the Term, (b) [XXXXXX] Retail                  Impressions during the second three months of the Term, (c)                  [XXXXXX] Retail Impressions during the third three months                  of the Term, and (d) [XXXXXX] Retail Impressions during                  the fourth three months of the Term. For such purposes, a                  "Retail Impression" means the display of one page of a CNET                  Site that contains at least one Retail Promotion. If CNET fails                  to provide the Retail Impressions required by the preceding                  sentence during the Term, then CNET will continue to display                  Retail Impressions in accordance with this Agreement following                  the Term (notwithstanding the termination or expiration of the                  Term) until the required number of Retail Impressions has been                  delivered.

     2.4  Placement of Retail Promotions. CNET will determine the location and           type of each Retail Promotion displayed throughout the CNET Sites and           may phase in certain types of Retail Promotions as they are developed.           CNET currently intends to display Retail Promotions consisting of           text/HTML links, pre-filled with an appropriate query string or link           ("Pre-Filled Links"), as set forth in this Section. The Retail           Promotions contemplated by this Section will be displayed above the           fold where the graphical layout of the page reasonably permits such           positioning (as determined by CNET), and in other cases the Retail           Promotions will be prominently positioned below the fold. For the           purposes of clarity, the "fold" is defined as the visible portion of           the screen on a standard 640 x 480 screen size.

          2.4.1  On SEARCH.COM, CNET intends to display a Pre-Filled Link on the





                 search query page related to Shopping and on every search                  results page served by CNET.

          2.4.2  On CNET.COM, CNET intends to display a Pre-Filled Link on pages                  within the site except the Front Door and except for pages                  within the Personalities and Community sections.

          2.4.3  On BUILDER.COM, CNET intends to display a Pre-Filled Link on                  pages within the site except the Front Door and the "Builder                  Buzz" section.

            2.4.4  On GAMECENTER.COM, NEWS.COM, DOWNLOAD.COM and SHAREWARE.COM,                  CNET will display a Pre-Filled Link on pages within the site                  except the Front Door.

          2.4.5  Other pages of the CNET Sites, CNET will display additional                  Retail Promotions as appropriate and as mutually agreed upon.

     2.5  Design and Production of Online Promotions. The Company will design           any graphics required for the Online Promotions and provide pre-filled           query strings or links for all of the Pre-Filled Links, with           reasonable assistance from CNET, and the Company will supply digital           copies of such graphics and other materials to CNET. CNET will be           responsible for incorporating the Online Promotions into the CNET           Sites and for ensuring that the Online Promotions are accessible to           users of the CNET Sites ("Users").

     2.6  Reporting. Within 30 days after the end of each month during the Term,           CNET will provide a report to the Company indicating the number of           Retail Promotions displayed on the CNET Sites during such month and           the number of times that a User clicked on a Retail Promotion during           such month. CNET will also provide standard reporting for banner           advertisements and television Promotions.

3.   The Company's Obligations:

     3.1  Operation of Company Site. The Company will be responsible for           ensuring that each link embedded within an Online Promotion takes the           User to the appropriate area within the Company Site, and that the           Company Site functions with reasonable reliability and in a           commercially reasonable manner throughout the Term. In particular, the           Company agrees that the Company Site will comply with the performance           standards set forth in Exhibit B throughout the Term. Any failure by           the Company to comply with this paragraph will be deemed to be a           material breach of this Agreement.

     3.2  Reporting. Within 30 days after the end of each month during the Term,           the Company will provide a report to CNET indicating the aggregate           number of referrals from the CNET Sites to the Company Site during           such month, the resulting number of buyers, the aggregate behavior           (including orders and sales volume) of those buyers, and the total           revenue attributable to the Online Promotions minus applicable sales           tax, shipping costs, returns and cancellations (the "CNET Sales"). The           "CNET Sales" will be counted as sales by the Company to each User who           accesses the Company Site through a link from an Online Promotion for           a period of 4 hours from the referral, CNET and The Company will agree           on technical procedures to allow the easy and accurate reporting of           CNET Sales. The Company will make this information available in a           manner which

            allows CNET and the Company to understand the performance of the           various Online Promotions.

     3.3  Cash Consideration.

          3.3.1  For each month during the Term, the Company will pay CNET a                  minimum of [XXXX] in cash, plus [XXX] of CNET Sales. Payments                  under this paragraph will be based on the reports prepared by                  the Company under Section 3.2 (although CNET may challenge such                  reports as contemplated by Section 9.5) and will be due within                  30 days after the end of each month of the Term.

          3.3.2  Payments under this Section 3.3 will be made by wire transfer                  of immediately available funds and are nonrefundable once paid.

     3.4  User Information. At least once each calendar quarter, the Company           will deliver to CNET all aggregate data collected as a result of the           CNET Sales, including but not limited to, demographic data, buying           behavior as measured by conversion to sale, frequency of purchasing,           average order size, and a comparison to the respective average for the           Company.

     3.5  Reciprocal Marketing. For the duration of the Term, the Company will           place a link within the Beta Report Newsletter, the Cyberian Express           Newsletter, the Gamer's Express newsletter, or any newsletter to which           users can subscribe to which is provided by the Company to its users           (expressly excluded from this obligation are emails that are sent by           the Company for product announcements, or personalized emails sent to           users upon product purchase. This link will be a text phrase or series           of text phrases encouraging the users to sign up for CNET's free email           newsletters for technology News, CNET Dispatch, and Software &           Hardware Services. CNET will provide all entry forms and operate the           production and sending of the newsletter. CNET agrees not to           specifically target these subscribers separately from the general





          database of subscribers to CNET's various newsletters. Should the           Company provide a persistent link or series of links (as distinguished           from occasional and ad hoc links to product reviews either on the           Company Site or in any communication by the Company to its customers)           to a "Technology Content Provider", CNET shall be given at least equal           prominence to any other Technology Content Provider provided that CNET           offers comparable editorial content. A Technology Content Provider is           defined as a company providing news product information or reviews           about technology products that is not a manufacturer of those           products.

4.   Term and Termination. The term of this Agreement (the "Term") will begin on      February 1, 1998 and end on the first anniversary of the date of this      Agreement; provided that (a) either party may terminate this Agreement,      effective at any time after the first three

       months of the Term, by giving 30 days' written notice of termination to the      other party, and (b) either party may terminate this Agreement at any time      by giving written notice of termination to the other party, if the other      party commits a material breach of its obligations hereunder that is not      cured within 30 days after notice thereof from the non-breaching party. If      this Agreement is terminated during any of the three month periods      referenced in Section 2.3.2, then the required number of Retail Impressions      applicable thereunder to such three month period will be pro rated      accordingly.

5.   Exclusivity. For purposes of this agreement "Competing Computer Products      Retailer" means any company other than the Company that is engaged in the      retail sale of computer products, with the exception of CNET Direct, which      operates BuyDirect.com. During the Term, CNET will not enter into more than      two other agreements under which CNET receives consideration from a      Competing Computer Products Retailer for displaying permanent links to or      other fixed promotions for such Competing Computer Products Retailer on any      CNET Site; provided that the foregoing will not restrict the display of(a)      standard advertisements for any Competing Computer Products Retailer or its      products or (b) any promotions within COMPUTERS.COM or within CNET's Snap!      Online service (which are expressly excluded from this provision). The      parties acknowledge that the foregoing will not prevent CNET from      displaying text links and other references to Competing Computer Products      Retailers as reasonably necessary to provide appropriate editorial and      search related services on the CNET Sites. The Retail Promotions granted to      the Company shall be placed in such a way as to provide no more or less      prominence to the Company than is provided to any other Competing Computer      Retailer signing an agreement with CNET.

6.  Trademark Licenses.

     6.1  The Company hereby grants to CNET a non-exclusive, royalty-free           license, effective throughout the Term, to use, display and publish           any of the Company trademarks, tradenames, service marks and logos           that may be delivered by the Company to CNET expressly for inclusion           in the Promotions, solely for use in connection with the Promotions.           Any use of the Company Marks by CNET must comply with any reasonable           usage guidelines communicated by the Company to CNET from time to           time. Nothing contained in this Agreement will give CNET any right,           title or interest in or to the Company Marks or the goodwill           associated therewith, except for the limited usage rights expressly           provided above. CNET acknowledges and agrees that, as between the           Company and CNET, the Company is the sole owner of all rights in and           to the Company Marks.

     6.2  The Company hereby represents and warrants to CNET that the Company           has, and will have throughout the Term, all necessary rights in and to           the Company Marks to grant CNET the licenses and usage rights           contemplated by this Agreement without violating the rights of any           third party.

  7.   Responsibility for the Company Products. The Company acknowledges and      agrees that, as between the Company and CNET, the Company will be solely      responsible for any claims or other losses associated with or resulting      from the marketing or operation of the Company Site or the offer or sale of      any Products by the Company or through the Company Site. CNET is not      authorized to make, and agrees not to make, any representations or      warranties concerning the Products, except to the extent (if any) contained      within Promotions delivered to CNET by the Company.

     8.1  Indemnification by CNET. CNET shall indemnify and hold the Company           harmless from and against any costs, losses, liabilities and expenses,           including all court costs, reasonable expenses and reasonable           attorney's fees (collectively, "Losses") that the Company may suffer,           incur or be subjected to by reason of any legal action, proceeding,           arbitration or other claim by a third party, whether commenced or           threatened, arising out of or as a result of (a) any breach or alleged           breach by CNET of its representations, warranties or covenants           hereunder; or (b) the operation of the CNET Sites (except in cases           where the Company is required to indemnify CNET under the following           paragraph), including claims of infringement or misappropriation of           intellectual property rights.

     8.2  Indemnification by the Company. The Company shall indemnify and hold           CNET harmless from and against any Losses that CNET may suffer, incur           or be subjected to by reason of any legal action, proceeding,





          arbitration or other claim by a third party, whether commenced or           threatened, arising out of or as a result of (a) any breach or alleged           breach by the Company of its representations, warranties or covenants           hereunder; (b) the use by CNET of the Company Marks or any content           provided by the Company to CNET expressly for display in connection           with or as part of the Promotions, including claims of infringement or           misappropriation of intellectual property rights; or (c) the operation           of the Company Site or the offer or sale of the Products by the           Company or through the Company Site.

     8.3  Indemnification Procedures. If any party entitled to indemnification           under this section (an "Indemnified Party") makes an indemnification           request to the other, the Indemnified Party shall permit the other           party (the "Indemnifying Party") to control the defense, disposition           or settlement of the matter at its own expense; provided that the           Indemnifying Party shall not, without the consent of the Indemnified           Party enter into any settlement or agree to any disposition that           imposes an obligation on the Indemnified Party that is not wholly           discharged or dischargeable by the Indemnifying Party, or imposes any           conditions or obligations on the Indemnified Party other than the           payment of monies that are readily measurable for purposes of           determining the monetary indemnification or reimbursement obligations           of Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Party shall

            notify Indemnifying Party promptly of any claim for which Indemnifying           Party is responsible and shall cooperate with Indemnifying Party in           every commercially reasonable way to facilitate defense of any such           claim; provided that the Indemnified Party's failure to notify           Indemnifying Party shall not diminish Indemnifying Party's obligations           under this Section except to the extent that Indemnifying Party is           materially prejudiced as a result of such failure. An Indemnified           Party shall at all times have the option to participate in any matter           or litigation through counsel of its own selection and at its own           expense.
