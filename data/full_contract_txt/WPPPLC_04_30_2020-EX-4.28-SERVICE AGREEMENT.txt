PLACE OF WORK 4.1 The Executive's normal place of work shall be the Company's head office in the UK from time to time as the Company may reasonably determine, for the proper performance of his duties. The Executive shall travel to such places (inside and) outside the UK as may be required in order to properly perform his duties, in particular, to the head office in the USA. In connection therewith, the Executive is likely from time to time to be required to work outside the UK for periods exceeding one month. 4.2 There are currently no additional terms which apply where the Executive is required to work outside the UK for a period exceeding one month, but the Company reserves the right to issue such terms, and any such terms will be notified to the Executive. 5. WORKING HOURS 5.1 The parties agree that the Executive's role and senior status are such that the Executive will determine the whole of his working time himself and his working time cannot be measured or pre-determined and, accordingly, that the Appointment falls within the scope of Regulation 20 of the Working Time Regulations 1998, meaning that the restrictions on working time set out in the Working Time Regulations do not apply to him. 5.2 During the Appointment, unless prevented by ill-health or accident and except during holiday taken in accordance with clause 11, the Executive shall devote the whole of his time, skill and attention during normal business hours, and at such other times as may be reasonably necessary (without additional remuneration), to his duties under this Agreement. 6. REMUNERATION 6.1 The Company will pay the Executive a salary of £740,000 and a fixed benefits allowance of £30,000 per annum. The salary (and so far, as is reasonably possible) the benefits allowance will accrue from day to day and be payable in equal instalments in arrears on or around the 25th day of every month, less deductions for income tax and National Insurance contributions and shall be inclusive of any fees receivable by the Executive as a director of any Group Company. 6.2 The Executive's salary will be reviewed by the Compensation Committee every two years.

Payment of a bonus to the Executive in 5





Table of Contents

one year shall confer no right on the Executive to receive a bonus in any other year. Specifically, but without limitation, the Executive shall have no right to be considered for, or payment of, a bonus where the Executive is subject to, or may about to be subject to, an ongoing investigation or disciplinary process into facts or matters which could lead to such bonus being forfeited, or reduced and in all events if the Appointment has terminated for any reason or if he is under notice of termination whether given by the Executive or the Company at or prior to the date when a bonus might otherwise have been payable. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Executive is exonerated of any of the allegations made during any such disciplinary process or if any investigation does not result in any material action against the Executive, he will (once the disciplinary process or investigation is concluded) have the right to be considered for a bonus as if there had been no such investigation or disciplinary process. If any bonus becomes payable in such circumstances it will be paid without delay following the conclusion of the disciplinary process or investigation. 6.5 The Executive hereby irrevocably consents to the Company, at any time during the Appointment or on its termination (however arising), deducting from salary or any other payments due to the Executive in respect of the Appointment any monies due from him to the Company or any Group Company. 6.6 The Executive agrees that every benefit arising out of or in connection with his employment whilst he remains a director is subject to change (including detrimental change without compensation) where any particular benefit paid, or otherwise owing or becoming payable to him in the future, breaches or may breach the terms of the shareholder approved Executive Compensation Policy at any time. 7. EXPENSES

The Company will reimburse the Executive (on production of such evidence as it may reasonably require) the amount of all travelling and other expenses properly and reasonably incurred by him in the discharge of his duties in strict accordance with the Company's expenses policy from time to time. 8. PENSION 8.1 The Company operates a Group pension plan (the Plan). The Executive is entitled to participate in the Plan (or such pension scheme as may be established by the Company to replace the Plan), subject to its trust deeds and rules from time to time. The Executive has opted out of the Plan. Whilst his status remains so, he will receive in lieu the annual sum of 10% of his current salary, paid monthly in instalments, together with his salary. 8.2 The Company reserves the right to terminate the Plan at any time without replacing it. In this event, and assuming he is, or has been, a member, the Executive's rights (if any) will be in accordance with the said trust deeds and rules. 8.3 The Executive has been grated Fixed Protection. The Company acknowledges that once the Executive has informed the Company that he has Fixed Protection, under Regulation 5D of the Occupational and Personal Pension Schemes (Automatic Enrolment) Regulations 2010 it does not need to automatically-enrol or automatically re-enrol the Executive into a pension scheme. The Company therefore agrees not to enrol the Executive in the Plan or any other pension scheme at any time after the Executive has informed the Company that he has Fixed Protection 2016,

The Company agrees in the meantime that it will not enrol the Executive into the Plan or any other pension scheme unless it is compelled to do so by law or the parties agree in writing otherwise. If the Company is compelled to enrol the Executive into the Plan or another pension scheme under law, or the Executive opts to join the Plan or any other pension scheme the Executive acknowledges and agrees that: 6

(a) the Company has no liability to him if payment of any contribution to, or the provision of any benefit under, the Plan (whether by itself or when aggregated with any contribution to or any increase in value of the Executive's rights under any other arrangement) gives rise to an annual allowance or lifetime allowance charge (within the meaning of the Finance Act 2004) and that the Company has no responsibility to make any enquiry or advise the Executive as to the possibility of any such charge; (b) he is liable for reporting and paying any such charge in accordance with the Finance Act 2004; and (c) the Company has no liability to him in respect of any loss for any reason of enhanced protection, fixed protection, fixed protection 2014, fixed protection 2016 or any similar protection allowed in future (for the purposes of the Finance Act 2004) if applicable to the Executive. 9. INSURANCES 9.1 In partial spend of the fixed benefits allowance referred to in sub-clause 6.1, the Executive and his spouse or civil partner and any children under the age of 21 (or 24 if in full time education) are entitled to membership of a private medical insurance scheme. 9.2 The Executive is entitled to membership of a Group income protection plan and life assurance cover, which will be paid for by the Company. 9.3 Participation in all insurance schemes from time to time is subject to: (a) the terms of the relevant insurance scheme, as amended from time to time; (b) the rules or the insurance policy of the relevant insurance provider, or WPP Healthcare Trust as amended from time to time; and (c) the Executive (and where relevant any other potential beneficiary) satisfying the normal underwriting requirements of the relevant insurance provider and the premium being at a rate which the Company considers reasonable. 9.4 If the insurer refuses for any reason to provide the benefit to the Executive (or any relevant dependant) the Company shall not be liable to provide to the Executive any replacement benefit of the same or similar kind or to pay any compensation in lieu of such benefit. Full details of the insurance schemes are available from the Company's Worldwide Compensation and Benefits Director. 9.5 For the avoidance of doubt, the Company's sole obligations in respect of the insurance benefits referred to in sub clause 9.1 and 9.2 is to pay the premia from time to time requested by the provider and to pay to the Executive any sums as may from time to time be received by the Company from the provider in respect of any claim made by the Executive (for him or a dependent) under any insurance scheme. 9.6 The Company shall have the right at its sole discretion to alter the cover provided or any term of any insurance scheme or to cease to provide (without replacement) any insurance scheme or cover at any time. 9.7 The Executive is entitled to the benefit of any indemnity in the Company's articles of association and may also entitled to the benefit of cover under such directors and officers liability insurance policy as may be maintained by the Company from time to time. 7

SICKNESS ABSENCE 10.1 If the Executive cannot attend work due to sickness or injury, the Executive will keep the Chairman informed of his condition and, where the absence lasts for a period of seven calendar days or more, the Executive will (at the request of the Company) produce a doctor's certificate to the Company in respect of his absence. (a) Provided the Executive complies with the Company's sickness absence notification and certification requirements, the Executive shall be entitled to receive his full salary and contractual benefits during any period of sickness absence not exceeding 26 weeks in any rolling period of 12 months. These payments shall be inclusive of any Statutory Sick Pay due.

If, at the Termination Date, the Executive has taken more holiday than he has accrued, the Executive hereby expressly consents to the Company deducting an appropriate amount from any payments otherwise due him. Deductions and payments in lieu of holiday are to be calculated on the basis that a day's holiday is equal to 1/260 of the Executive's basic salary. 12. OTHER INTERESTS

If the Company elects to terminate the Executive's employment in this way, it will make, within 30 days, either the first instalment (of equal monthly instalments) of a, or an entire, payment in lieu of notice (Payment in Lieu) equal to the basic salary, benefit allowance and any benefits, as at the Termination Date, which the Executive would have been entitled to receive under this Agreement during the notice period referred to at sub clause 15.1 (or, if notice has already been given, during the remainder of the notice period), less all relevant deductions for income tax and National Insurance contributions. For the avoidance of doubt, the Payment in Lieu shall not include any element in relation to: (a) any bonus or discretionary payment(s) that might otherwise have been due during the period for which the Payment in Lieu is made; and (b) any payment in respect of any holiday entitlement that would have accrued during the period for which the Payment in Lieu is made. 15.3 The Company may pay any sums due under sub clause 15.2 in equal monthly instalments until the date on which the notice period referred to at sub clause 15.1 would have expired if notice had been given (the Payment Period). 15.4 The Payment in Lieu is at all times conditional on the Executive informing the Company immediately in the event that he receives, or has a right to receive, remuneration from any source in respect of his employment or the provision of his services during the Payment Period or relating to the Payment Period (remuneration shall include any salary, fee or other benefit). 15.5 If the Executive obtains alternative employment or an alternative engagement during the Payment Period any further monthly instalments of the Payment in Lieu will be reduced on a pro rata basis by any payment or remuneration in respect of such alternative employment or alternative engagement during the Payment Period or relating to the Payment Period. 15.6 The Executive shall have no right to receive a Payment in Lieu unless the Company has exercised its discretion in sub clause 15.2. 15.7 Nothing in this clause 15 shall prevent the Company from terminating the Appointment in breach of contract or of common law. 15.8 If the Executive: (a) in the reasonable opinion of the Board fails or neglects efficiently and diligently to discharge his duties, including, without limitation his duties under Chapter 2 of part 10 of the Companies Act 2006, or is guilty of any serious or repeated material breach of his obligations under this Agreement and, if that material breach is remediable, fails to remedy the breach within a period of 21 days after being notified in writing to do so; (b) is guilty of any fraud, dishonesty, serious misconduct or any other conduct which, in the reasonable opinion of the Board, brings or is likely to bring the Executive or the Company or 12

the Company may by written notice to the Executive terminate this Agreement with immediate effect. 15.9 The Company's rights under clause 15.8 are without prejudice to any other rights that it might have at common law to terminate the Appointment or to accept any breach of this Agreement by the Executive as having brought the agreement to an end. Any delay by the Company in exercising its rights shall not constitute a waiver thereof. 15.10 On the Termination Date or, at the request of the Board on either party giving notice to terminate this Agreement, the Executive will immediately: (a) deliver to the Company all other property in his possession, custody or under his control belonging to any Group Company including (but not limited to) computers and any other electronic devices, business cards, credit and charge cards, security passes, original and copy documents or other media on which information is held in his possession relating to the business or affairs of any Group Company; and (b) to the extent possible, irretrievably delete (without keeping any copies in any format) any information relating to the business or affairs of the Company or any Group Company or any of its or their business contacts from any computer or communications systems, including any website or email account, owned or used by the Executive outside the Company's premises and notify the Company of any passwords the Executive used in relation to its computer system. 15.11 If the Executive's rights or benefits under any share option or share incentive scheme in which the Executive may participate (as set out at the date hereof in Schedule 2) are affected by the termination of the Employment, his rights will be determined solely in accordance with the rules of the relevant scheme and the Executive shall not be entitled to any compensation for the loss of any rights or benefits under such scheme. 15.12 If the Appointment is terminated for the purpose of the reconstruction or amalgamation of the Company or by reason of the Company transferring all or a substantial part of its business to another company and the Executive is offered employment by the reconstructed or amalgamated or transferee company on similar terms to the terms of this Agreement, the Executive will have no claim 13





Table of Contents

against the Company or such reconstructed or amalgamated or transferee company in respect of the termination of the Appointment. 16. GARDEN LEAVE 16.1 Following service of notice to terminate the Appointment by either party or if the Executive purports to terminate the Appointment in breach, the Board may suspend all or any of the Executive's duties and powers for such periods and on such terms as he considers expedient and this may include a term that: (a) the Executive must stay away from all or any of the Company's premises, and/or (b) will not be provided with any work, and/or (c) will have no business contact with all or any of the Group's agents, employees, customers, clients, distributors and suppliers, and/or (d) will have no access to the Company's communications systems.

(referred to as Garden Leave). 16.2 During any period of Garden Leave the Company will continue to pay the Executive's salary, benefits allowance and maintain the benefits to which he is contractually entitled prior to the commencement of his Garden Leave (for the avoidance of doubt the Executive shall not be entitled to any bonus or discretionary payment(s) during any period of Garden Leave). 16.3 During any period of Garden Leave may appoint a replacement to exercise any of the Executive's duties and responsibilities and may require the Executive to take such actions as he reasonably requires to effect a proper handover of any of his duties and responsibilities. Alternatively, the Company may require the Executive to carry out exceptional duties or special projects outside the normal scope of his duties and responsibilities (provided such projects are broadly commensurate with his status). 16.4 During any period of Garden Leave the Executive's employment will continue and the Executive will continue to be bound by his obligations under this Agreement and by his general duties of fidelity and good faith (and, where applicable, as a fiduciary). The Executive agrees that the Company may, if it so chooses, announce to third parties that the Executive has resigned or been given notice (as the case may be) but the Executive will not make any comment on his status or change of duties, except to confirm he is on garden leave. 17. OFFICE AS A DIRECTOR 17.1 Any office or directorship which the Executive holds in any Group Company is subject to the articles of association of the relevant company from time to time. 17.2 The Executive is required to familiarise himself with all his responsibilities as a director, legal and/or otherwise. 17.3 Upon termination of this Agreement, or on the Board's request, the Executive will resign from any office held by him in any Group Company without any claim for compensation. 17.4 The Executive shall, at the time of signing this Agreement, appoint the Company as his attorney by executing a Power of Attorney in the form set out in Schedule 1 so that the Company can give effect to the provisions of sub clause 17.3 above and clause 14 above as required. 14

17.5 In the event that the Executive fails to be re-elected as a director of any Group Company, or if the Executive resigns as a director of any Group Company at the Company's request, this Agreement shall not automatically terminate and the Executive will continue as an employee of the Company unless and until either party elect to terminate the employment (either in accordance with clause 15.1, or where the Company may have a right to terminate his employment summarily under clause 15 or at common law). 17.6 The Executive must not resign from any directorship or office of any Group Company, except on termination of this Agreement (by either party), on the Board's request or as provided in the articles of association of the Company, and he must not do anything that would cause him to be disqualified from continuing to act as a director. 18. PROTECTIVE COVENANTS 18.1 The Executive acknowledges that his senior position with the Company and any Group Company gives him access to and the benefit of confidential information vital to the continuing business of the Company and any Group Company and influence over and connection with the Company's customers, clients, suppliers, distributors, agents, employees, workers, consultants and directors and those of any Group Company in or with which the Executive is engaged or in contact and acknowledges and agrees that the provisions in Schedule 3 are reasonable in their application to him and necessary but no more than sufficient to protect the interests of the Company and any Group Company. 18.2 If any person offers to the Executive any arrangement, contractual or otherwise, and whether paid or unpaid, which might or would cause the Executive to breach any of the covenants in Schedule 3, he will notify that person of the terms of that Schedule 3 and provide that person with a complete copy of it. 19. DATA PROTECTION 19.1 The Company takes its data protection obligations very seriously and complies with its legal obligations under the General Data Protection Regulation and the Data Protection Act 2018 to protect the privacy and security of the Executive's personal information. As a data controller the Company is required to inform the Executive how we hold and use his information. 20. GRIEVANCE AND DISCIPLINARY PROCEDURE 20.1 If the Executive is dissatisfied with any disciplinary decision relating to him, including any decision to dismiss him, he will have the right to appeal to the Chairman of WPP plc, whose decision will be final. 20.2 If the Executive seeks to redress any grievance relating to his employment, the Executive should raise this in the first instance with the Chairman. If the matter is not satisfactorily resolved, the Executive should then apply in writing to the Board and the Board's decision will be final. 20.3 The Company may suspend the Executive from any or all of his duties for as long as is reasonably necessary to investigate any matter in which the Executive is implicated or involved, whether directly or indirectly, or in the event that the Company believes that the Executive's presence in the office would be detrimental to any investigation or to other employees or to the Executive. The provisions of clause 16.1 (a) to (d) and 16.2 will apply during any such period of suspension, with any additional terms depending on the circumstances that may be notified to the Executive in writing at that time. 15
