*** Text Omitted and Filed Separately  Confidential Treatment Requested Under 17 C.F.R. §§ 200.80(b)(4)  and 203.406

DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT

This Development Agreement ("Development Agreement") is entered into on April 15 , 2010 ("EffectiveDate") by and between Cargill,  Incorporated through its Bio Technology Development Center, having its principal place of business at 15407 McGinty Road West, Wayzata,  Minnesota 55391 USA ("Cargill") and Bioamber S.A.S., having a place of business at Route de Bazancourt, F-51110, Pomacle France ("Bioamber").  Bioamber and Cargill shall be referred to individually as "Party" and collectively as "Parties", as required by text.

Background





Cargill and Bioamber mutually agree as follows:







   Cargill Confidential   - 1 -   * Confidential treatment requested

  A. Cargill has developed a yeast strain designated CB1 ("CB1") for fermenting dextrose and/or mixed sugar streams and related research  tools for modifying CB1,which are protected by Licensed Patents (as defined in Section 2.5 below).

  B. Bioamber desires to engage Cargill to further develop or modify CB1 with the goal of fermenting dextrose and/or mixed sugar streams to  produce succinic acid and salts thereof.

  C. The Parties desire to grant each other certain rights to use the further developed or modified CB1 as well as other technology that is  developed in the course of the work as provided in this Development Agreement for research purposes only.

1. Scope of Work Plan  1.1 Cargill agrees to perform the services to develop or modify CB1 to produce succinic acid and salts thereof using dextrose (defined as  glucose) and/or sucrose as the fermentation feedstock ("Work Plan"). The Work Plan is more fully described in Exhibit A, which is hereby  incorporated by reference into this Development Agreement. CB1 that has been further developed or modified (or the like) under the Work  Plan shall be referred to as "Modified CB1". Any changes to the Work Plan must be in writing and signed by both Cargill and Bioamber and  may be subject to incremental fees depending on resource requirements.

1.2 In agreeing to perform the Work Plan, Cargill represents and warrants that:

  1.2.1 Cargill has the capability, experience, and means necessary to perform the Work Plan, and the Work Plan will be performed using  personnel, equipment, and material qualified and suitable to perform the Work Plan requested;

th

















   Cargill Confidential   - 2 -   * Confidential treatment requested

  1.2.2 Cargill will provide properly trained and informed personnel, and Cargill will be solely responsible for the negligent acts, errors and  omissions of its employees, subcontractors, and agents and for any other person performing services under this Development  Agreement at the direct request of Cargill;

  1.2.3 Cargill will perform the Work Plan in a workmanlike manner with reasonable skill and care ordinarily exercised by members of the  profession practicing under similar conditions and in accordance with accepted industry practices and professional guidelines;

  1.2.4 Subject to Section 13.1, Cargill has in effect and will maintain in effect all permits, licenses and other authorizations necessary to  perform the Work Plan; and



1.2.5 No other party has rights to its services as described in the Work Plan, and that a work assignment from any third party shall not be  accepted, or work by Cargill aloneshall not be conducted, to develop CB1 or other microorganisms that will be used to (a) directly  produce succinic acid and salts thereof, or (b) indirectly produce succinic acid and salts thereof (for example, Cargill may develop  microorganisms to produce precursors of succinic acid, such as fumaric acid and malic acid, so long as such precursors are not  converted to succinic acid, such as by chemical modification), for the Term (as defined in Section 10.1) of this Development  Agreement. For purposes of clarity, and as examples, Cargill may sell dextrose as fermentation feedstock to third parties, who may  use such dextrose to produce succinic acid; also, Cargill may modify starches to make succinic acid starch derivatives.

2. Fees and Milestones   2.1 Bioamber shall pay Cargill Two Hundred Fifty Thousand U.S. Dollars ($250,000.00) within thirty (30) days of the execution of this  Development Agreement.

2.2 In addition to the payment in Section 2.1, Bioamber shall pay Cargill a total of [***] U.S. Dollars ($[***] per year per full-time equivalent  (FTE) person to perform the Work Plan, and Cargill will make available up to [***] FTE persons per year to perform the work as outlined in  the Work Plan. Such total is subject to change based on an annual review of the needs and requirements of the Work Plan. The actual  number of FTEs assigned at any given time will be a function of the Work Plan and will be subject to agreement amongst the Parties. In  addition, Bioamber will pay for reasonable expenses incurred by Cargill, including travel. Cargill shall cover ordinary and customary [***].  Cargill shall submit to Bioamber a monthly invoice for costs owed by Bioamber, accompanied by a report summarizing Cargill's activities in  relation to actual hours worked and expenses incurred. Bioamber will pay Cargill's costs within thirty (30) days of receipt of invoice and  supporting documentation. Bioamber shall have the right to audit Cargill time sheets from time to time. Such audit shall occur once per year  during reasonable business hours by an independent third party agreed to by both parties, who shall be under obligations of  confidentiality.













   Cargill Confidential   - 3 -   * Confidential treatment requested

2.3 Bioamber shall also pay Cargill within thirty (30) days of achieving each of the milestones summarized below and more fully described in the  Work Plan found in Exhibit A. For purposes of clarity, payment is triggered [***]. Further, each of the Milestones and Target Dates may be  changed according to the needs of the Work Plan and upon written agreement by the parties.

Milestone   Target Date   Payment  Milestone 1: Proof of Concept   12 months after Effective Date   US $250,000.00 Milestone 2: CB1 Strain Development   30 months after Effective Date   US $300,000.00 Milestone 3: CB1 Strain Optimization   42 months after Effective Date   US $500,000.00

2.4 Missed Milestones.



2.4.1 In the event Cargill does not achieve a given Milestone provided in Section 2.3 by the Target Date listed in Section 2.3 or modified  Milestone and modified Target Date as agreed to by the Parties, and subsequently achieves such milestone as per the criteria  described in Exhibit A, the payment for such missed milestone shall be due [***] and the amount due shall be [***] for every [***]  beyond the Target Date. The Target Date for subsequent Milestones will be adjusted to reflect the date on which the Milestone was  actually achieved. If a subsequent Milestone is achieved by the original Target Date listed in Section 2.3, Bioamber will pay Cargill  the amount [***]. For purposes of clarity and as examples, if Milestones 1 and 2 were not delivered by the Target Dates, but  Milestone 3 is delivered by or before the Target Date, then the total payments due to Cargill at that time would be [***] (a total  payment of $[***]). Another example is if [***], the payment due at that time would be a total of $[***].



2.4.2 In the event Cargill does not achieve a given Milestone provided in Section 2.3 by the Target Date listed in Section 2.3 or modified  Milestone and modified Target Date as agreed to by the Parties, and Bioamber decides to commercialize Modified CB1, any  outstanding milestone payments shall immediately become due such that the total payment due Cargill under this Development  Agreement equals One Million Fifty Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $1,050,000.00).









   Cargill Confidential   - 4 -   * Confidential treatment requested

  2.4.3 Provided that Cargill has respected its undertakings set out in Section 1.2 of this Development Agreement, no other damages shall  accrue to Cargill for not achieving a given Milestone other than provided in Sections 2.4.1, 2.4.2, and 2.5.

2.5 Option to Research License. In the event Cargill (i) is unable to achieve a given milestone described in Section 2.3 by the Target Date, or (ii)  terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.2, Bioamber shall have the option to obtain a license during the term of this Development  Agreement to the patent applications and patents listed in Exhibit B (including any continuations, continued prosecutions, continuations- in-part, reissues, reexaminations, divisions or substitutions thereof) (collectively "Licensed Patents"), the tool kit listed in Exhibit C  ("Licensed Tool Kit"), and Cargill Improvements if any (as defined in Section 5.2 below), for research use only and for additional monetary  consideration ("Research License"). Except for financial terms paid by third parties for [***], the Research License shall be offered to  Bioamber at [***]. Such research use shall be for the development and optimization of CB1 for the production of succinic acid and salts  thereof using dextrose or sucrose as the fermentation feedstock. The Research License shall be provided to Bioamber only, with no rights  to sublicense and with no "have made" rights. Notwithstanding the preceding, Bioamber will be permitted to outsource development work  as outlined in the Work Plan and according to the Research License to third parties that have been approved by Cargill, and such approval  shall not be unreasonably withheld. In considering whether or not to outsource such development work to third parties, the Parties  recognize that it is in their mutual interest to protect CB1, Modified CB1, Cargill Confidential Information (as defined in Section 4.1), and  Know-How and Licensed Patents (as those terms are defined under the Commercial License Agreement) and, therefore, the Parties shall  undertake joint evaluations of third parties who have been identified by Bioamber to perform such development work, including, for  example and not by limitation, a risk assessment of the geography in which such development work will occur, and whether or not such  third parties have similar guiding principles as Cargill (a copy of Cargill's Guiding Principles and Compliance Policy on Intellectual Property  is attached as Exhibit F). Such development work shall not be conducted by such third parties in circumstances where Cargill's intellectual  property is at an unacceptable risk as determined by Cargill based on the joint evaluations of such third parties. The terms and conditions  of such Research License shall be negotiated between the Parties and shall include the terms described in this Section 2.5 and terms  addressing ownership and rights to use of any intellectual property developed. Further, this Development Agreement shall serve as the  framework for the Research License.

2.6 Technology Transfer. In the event Milestone 3 is achieved, Cargill will provide up to [***] to assist in a successful transfer of the Modified  CB1 technology to Bioamber in order to allow subsequent scale-up at the same FTE rate set forth in Section 2.2. For clarity, [***] per FTE  per year equals US$[***] for this technology transfer).













   Cargill Confidential   - 5 -   * Confidential treatment requested

2.7 Scale-Up. Following the successful technology transfer, upon request by Bioamber and subject to Cargill's availability of appropriate  resources, Cargill will enter at its sole discretion into a services agreement with Bioamber to assist in the fermentation scale-up of using  Modified CB1 obtained under Milestones 2 and 3 for producing succinic acid and salts thereof at a single Bioamber facility or a facility  designated by Bioamber. Cargill shall invoice Bioamber [***] U.S. Dollars (US$[***]) per man-day provided, not inclusive of taxes or other  governmental fees, and further adjusted for inflation at the time it goes into effect. Cargill shall have no obligation to perform scale-up work  at Cargill facilities.

3. Alternative Feedstock. Bioamber also desires the right to further develop CB1 to utilize cellulosic biomass as the fermentation feedstock.  Cargill hereby grants Bioamber the option to modify or convert the Work Plan to include the development or modification of CB1 capable of  fermenting such cellulosic feedstock ("Modified Work Plan"). If such option is exercised, (a) the terms and conditions of this Development  Agreement shall apply to the Modified Work Plan except (i) new, additional up-front and milestone payments shall apply as provided  below, and (ii) any development work performed under the Modified Work Plan will be at a FTE rate which will be equivalent to the FTE rate  provided in Section 2.2 above and further adjusted for inflation at the time it goes into effect; and (b) the commercial license attached as  Exhibit D shall be expanded to include the resulting strain developed out of the Modified Work Plan with no additional change in the  financial terms. Additionally, the additional up-front fee [***].
