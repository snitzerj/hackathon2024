NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of these premises and of the mutual covenants and agreements hereinafter contained, the sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged by the parties, the parties hereto agree as follows: 1. Services Provided by S2K. S2K agrees, subject to the provisions of this Agreement, through its Authorized S2K Representatives, to use its reasonable best efforts to market the Funds to the Intermediaries, and to identify, refer and/or introduce Intermediaries to the Funds. In connection therewith, S2K may (i) engage in seminars, conferences and media interviews for financial intermediaries; (ii) distribute sales literature and other communications (including electronic media) regarding the Funds, subject to review and approval of such material by the Distributor; and (iii) perform other services reasonably contemplated in writing by S2K and the Distributor.

S2K will market the Funds to Intermediaries that: (a) are registered as "broker-dealers" with the SEC, FINRA, and any other applicable jurisdiction in which they operate and are required to be so registered by law;

(b) will enter into a Selling Agreement agreed to by Distributor and such "broker-dealers," or in such other form of Intermediary agreement (which shall include, without limitation, broker/dealer Selling Agreements, platform agreements and wirehouse agreements) as required by an Intermediary with the Distributor to sell shares of the Funds to investors (copies of which shall be made available to S2K); and (c) will sell shares of the Funds through representatives in accordance with the then-current applicable Prospectus and in accordance with the provisions of the Selling Agreement. 2. Services Provided by the Distributor. (a) The Distributor will coordinate the completion and execution of Selling Agreements with broker-dealers and/or Intermediaries. (b) Advertising and Sales Literature Review (i) The Distributor shall provide review of broker-dealer related advertising and sales literature pieces ("marketing pieces") submitted to Distributor by S2K. Documentation (which shall include electronic correspondence) not defined as "marketing pieces," which shall include, but is not limited to, correspondence and materials provided directly in response to due diligence requests, shall be principally reviewed and approved by S2K. (ii) Distributor's services are based on the understanding that S2K will utilize current systems and expertise owned by Distributor, specifically the AdLit Advertising Review System ("AdLit"), and that Distributor will base its reviews on: (i) the guidelines contained within Distributor's Sales and Advertising Guide and Distributor's Written Supervisory Procedures; (ii) rules and guidance issued by FINRA and the SEC related to communications with the public and/or communications to institutional investors, as those terms are defined in FINRA Rules 2210 and 2211 and in various other FINRA and SEC rules and interpretive material; and (iii) Distributor's submission guidelines with respect to the use of trademarked and/or copyright materials, to the extent applicable. All material submitted to Distributor will be provided by Distributor to S2K with comments or approval no later than three business days after receipt in AdLit. (iii) Each marketing piece submitted to Distributor for review will be subject to the following process: a) Each piece will undergo review at Distributor by a FINRA-licensed registered principal possessing the required expertise and appropriate license to review the marketing piece submitted to Distributor; b) Distributor's comments shall consist of (i) recommendations for changes that, in the opinion of the Distributor reviewer, will be consistent with the guidelines specified by Distributor in Section 2(b)(ii) above, or (ii) in the form of an acknowledgement that the submitted material is consistent with such guidelines with no additional changes.

c) Distributor will provide system training and ongoing consulting with respect to advertising review guidelines and rules for each marketing piece submitted via the process described herein; and d) Distributor will make all required FINRA filings of marketing materials which have been approved by Distributor. (iv) If S2K wishes Distributor to perform an expedited review of marketing pieces within one business day of Distributor' receipt of such marketing pieces, the expedited review will be performed subject to and in accordance with the following: a) A charge of $250 will apply to each request for expedited review, in addition to FINRA filing fees. b) The marketing piece must be 30 pages or less in actual length in order to be considered for expedited review. Web pages and other marketing pieces over 30 pages require a more in-depth review; therefore, Distributor cannot guarantee a one business day review for these items. c) The marketing piece must be submitted via Distributor's AdLit system by no later than 3:00 P.M. Mountain Time (2:00 P.M. PT/5:00 P.M. ET) on a business day in order to ensure that the Distributor has a full one business day to review and provide S2K with comments within such one business day timeframe. d) S2K must check the box on the AdLit coversheet whereby S2K requests and accepts the terms and fee(s) associated with expedited review in order to ensure that Distributor is notified of the expedited request. e) Distributor cannot guarantee that a marketing piece will be APPROVED within one business day of being received via AdLit. Distributor will review and submit comments to S2K within this timeframe. If Distributor fails to provide S2K with comments within one business day, the $250 expedited review charge will not apply. 3. Performance Requirements. S2K shall devote sufficient staff and expenditures to the performance of its services as shall be consistent with industry standards for the marketing of shares of the Fund. S2K shall perform these services in a professional and competent manner and shall provide such office space and equipment, telephone facilities and personnel as it determines may be reasonably necessary or beneficial in order to provide such services at no cost to the Distributor. 4. Duration and Termination. The term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall end on the 60th day following a written notice from one party to the other of its decision to terminate this Agreement at the end of such 60-day period or upon termination of the applicable Distribution Agreement with respect to a Fund. Termination of this Agreement as to a Fund shall not terminate this Agreement with respect to any other Fund so long as such other Fund's (or Funds', as the case may be) Distribution Agreement is effective. If this Agreement is terminated by one party, it shall terminate the entire Agreement.
