   WHEREAS, the Agent and the Company wish to enter into an arrangement wherein the Agent would promote, sell, and collect payment for, such Products for the Company as a representative ("Agent") of the Company within the United States of America to duly licensed veterinarians (the "Customers") on the terms provided herein;

   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the mutual promises and covenants contained herein, the parties hereby agree as follows:

                      1. APPOINTMENT AND ACCEPTANCE.

   1.1. Appointment. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company hereby appoints the Agent, and the Agent hereby accepts appointment, as an authorized distributor agent within the Territory, (Territory as outlined in section 1.2), for the promotion, sale and collection of payment for, the Products to Customers. The Company has appointed a limited number of Agents; however, the Company retains the right to itself, and/or appoint others to, promote, sell, and collect payment for, and distribute, the Products to Customers in the Territory.

   1.2. Territory. The Territory is defined as that geographical area in which said Agent is represented by a full time field sales representative, and of which assigned Distributor agrees to be responsible for mutually agreed upon quarterly and annual sales objectives as described in the "Business Plan".

No compensation will be earned by the Agent for sales generated from customers in geographical areas not indicated in this section 1.2.

   1.3. Business Plan. The Company and the Agent will jointly develop a written business plan for the promotion, distribution and sale of the Products to Customers in the Territory for each year (Nov 1 - Oct 31) during the term of this Agreement (a "Contract Year") and, on a nonbinding preliminary basis, for the next succeeding Contract Year (a "Business Plan"). Each Business Plan will include, among other things, sales and marketing strategies, advertising and promotion plans, financial projections (including projected sales, expenses and other customary items) and Agent performance criteria (including, but not limited to, market penetration, sales promotion execution, Product availability/accessibility and trade support).

The Business Plan relating to Contract Year ending Oct 31, 1999 will be agreed upon at least thirty (30) days after the Agent Launch Date (as defined below) or at a mutually agreed upon date and location. The Business Plan relating to all Contract Years thereafter will be agreed upon not less than sixty (60) days (or at a mutually agreed upon date and location) prior to the start of the Contract Year to which it relates. The Company and the Agent will negotiate the terms and conditions of each Business Plan in good faith, using their respective best efforts to agree upon such terms and conditions.

         (f) meet with the Company at least once each quarter (starting with       the quarter in which the Agent Launch Date occurs), at a mutually       agreeable time and place to discuss and review the Agent's activities       hereunder, at which meeting the Agent will make available to the Company       information concerning the Agent's sale and marketing of the Products in       the Territory during the quarter and year-to-date, such information to       include details of sales efforts, Product sales volume and such other       information as may be mutually agreed upon in each Business Plan;

         (g) at least thirty (30) days prior to use or distribution of any       sales, promotion or training materials relating to the Products (other       than materials provided to the Agent by the Company for such purpose),       submit such materials to the Company for review, give due consideration to       any comments received from the Company with respect to such materials, and       not use or distribute any such materials without the express prior written       consent of the Company (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or       delayed); and

         (l) follow the Company's credit policy (See Paragraph 2.3 Payment       Terms) or program terms promptly in payment of goods shipped to the       Customer. Product(s) shipped to the Customer will be billed to the Agent       at the price stated on a current price list or according to the current       price program minus a ten (10) percent discount as outlined in Paragraph       1.5(d). It is the responsibility of the Agent to evaluate the credit       worthiness of the Customer. Upon transmitting an order for shipment to the       Company, the Agent accepts full responsibility for payment of the product       from the Customer.

         (m) transmit all orders, taken from the Customer for Product(s), a       minimum of once daily basis, by either fax, electronic mail, or other       agreed upon means of transmission so as to afford the Company time to       process and ship said orders in an expediant manner.

         (n) sell products only at the Company's current stated list or       promotional price.

   1.5 Company Obligations. Except as otherwise expressly provided in the Business Plan, the Company will at its sole expense:

         (a) use its reasonable best efforts to fill and ship all accepted       orders for Products received from the Agent on a daily basis so as to be       shipped no later than the next business day. Orders received on Fridays or       the day before holidays will not be shipped until the next business day       unless special arrangements have been made at the customers expense. The       Company will supply a list confirming such order shipments to the Agent by       the end of the next business day. If orders exceed the available inventory       levels, the Company will use reasonable efforts to inform the Agent and       ship the remaining inventory in a manner that the Company deems as being       fair and equitable. If product becomes available during a backorder, the       Company will ship orders on a first-come, first-serve basis, but can, at       its





6

                                    -5-

   own discretion, give partial shipments to large orders. In no event will       the Company be obligated to provide Products to the Agent in excess of one       hundred and twenty percent (120%) of any maximum quantity specified in the       applicable Business Plan;

         (b) provide to the Agent's field sales personnel at least four (4)       hours of initial Products sales and marketing training, and Agent       telesales personnel at least one (1) hour of initial Product sales and       marketing training, and such supplemental training, if any, as the Company       may deem appropriate, in each case, at such times and locations as may be       mutually agreed upon by the Company and the Agent.

         (c) supply such literature, ad reprints and other promotional aids       and furnish Agent with other information that in the opinion of the       Company may be helpful in the sale of listed Product(s).

         (d) compensate the Agent through a discount of eight (8) percent off       of the current price of the Product times the total monthly units shipped       at that price to the Customer in the Agent's Territory excluding any       taxes, and/or shipping and handling charges incurred by the Company. The       Company will compensate the Agent an additional two (2) percent through a       discount off of the current price or promotional price of the Product       times the total monthly units shipped at that price to the Customer       excluding any taxes, and/or shipping and handling charges incurred by the       Company, so as to compensate the Agent's sales representatives. Therefore,       a total of ten (10) percent discount off of the current price list or       promotional price times the total monthly units shipped at that price to       the Customer will be applied as payment for services from the Agent       including, but not limited to, the promotion, sales, and collection of       payment from the Customer for Product shipped by the Company. In addition       the Company will compensate the Agent quarterly an additional two (2)       percent commission (incentive), exclusive of taxes, and /or shipping and       handling charges incurred by the Company, based upon the attainment of       mutually agreed upon quarterly goals. One (1) percent of this incentive is       additional compensation for the Agent, and one (1) percent is for       additional compensation of the Agency sales force. In the event the Agent       fails to achieve these goals during any given quarter yet is able to       achieve the overall annual goals, then the Agent will receive the       incentive commission for that quarter at the conclusion of the fiscal       year. These goals are outlined in exhibit B.

         (e) will replace, any unit of Product to the Customer which has       outdated (provided the Product is not outdated more than ninety (90) days)       with equal Product.    7

   3.5. Indemnification.

         (a) Subject to Subparagraph (c) below, the Agent will indemnify the       Company (and its officers, directors, employees, agents and affiliates)       and hold it (and them) harmless from and against all loss, damage,       liability, cost or expense of any nature whatsoever, including, without       limitation, any and all reasonable attorneys fees and court costs       (together, a "Loss"), arising out of or in connection with (i) the       inaccuracy or breach of any representation, warranty or obligation of the       Agent hereunder and/or (ii) the activities of the Agent in connection with       the promotion, sale or collection of payment of the Products in violation       of this Agreement, law or any other duty or obligation of the Agent. In no       way should the Agent be liable for incidental or consequential damages.





         (b) Subject to Subparagraph (c) below, the Company will indemnify       the Agent (and its officers, directors, employees, agents and affiliates)       and hold it (and them) harmless from and against any Loss arising out of       or in connection with the inaccuracy or breach of any representation,       warranty or obligation of the Company hereunder.

         (c) Each party (the "Notifying Party") will promptly notify the       other party (the "Indemnifying Party") of the existence of any third party       claim, demand or other action giving rise to a claim for indemnification       under this Paragraph 3.5 (a "Third Party Claim") and will give the       Indemnifying Party a reasonable opportunity to defend the same at its own       expense and with its own counsel provided that the Notifying Party will at       all times have the right to participate in such defense at its own       expense. If, within thirty (30) days after receipt of a notice of a Third       Party Claim the Indemnifying Party fails to undertake to so defend, the       Notifying Party will have the right, but not the obligation, to defend and       to compromise or settle (exercising reasonable business judgment) the       Third Party Claim for the account and at the risk and expense of the       Indemnifying Party subject to the Indemnifying Party's prior written       approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Each       party will make available to the other, at the other's reasonable expense,       such information and assistance as    11

                                   -10-

Except as may be required by law or as may be reasonably necessary to enforce rights hereunder, each party agrees that during the term of this Agreement and thereafter (a) it will use Confidential Information belonging to the other solely for the purpose(s) of this Agreement and (b) it will not disclose Confidential Information belonging to the other to any third party (other than its employees and/or consultants reasonably requiring such Confidential Information for purposes of this Agreement who are bound by obligations of nondisclosure and limited use at least as stringent as those contained herein) without the express prior written consent of the disclosing party. Each party further agrees that except as reasonably necessary for performance hereunder or otherwise expressly required by law, it will not publicly announce or otherwise disclose any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement without the express prior written consent of the other. Except as may be otherwise expressly provided in the Business Plan, or as may be required by law or reasonably necessary to enforce rights hereunder, neither party will use the name of the other in any advertising, promotional or sales materials relating to the Products, in any press release, or in any other manner whatsoever without the express prior written consent of the other.

   5.3. Waivers. Any waiver by either party of any rights arising from a breach of any covenants or conditions of this Agreement must be in writing and will not be construed as a continuing waiver of other breaches of the same nature or other covenants or conditions of this Agreement.

   5.4. Relationship of Parties This Agreement is not intended to create, nor should it be construed as creating, a joint venture, partnership or similar relationship between the parties. The Agent will act solely as an independent agent and will have no right to bind the Company in any way or to represent that the Company is in any way responsible for any acts or omissions of the Agent.

   5.5. Force Majeure. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if either the Company or the Agent is delayed in or prevented from fulfilling any of its obligations hereunder by reason of any cause beyond its reasonable control (including, but not limited to acts of God, fire, third party strike,





flood, delay of transportation or inability to obtain necessary raw materials through normal commercial channels), then that party will not be liable under this Agreement for damages resulting from such delay or failure.

   5.8. Remedies. All remedies available to either party for breach of this Agreement are cumulative and may be exercised concurrently or separately. The exercise of one remedy will not be deemed an election of such remedy to the exclusion of other remedies.

   5.9. Severability. In the event any provision of this Agreement, in whole or in part, is invalid, unenforceable or in conflict with the applicable laws or    15

                                   -14-

regulations of any jurisdiction, such provision will be replaced, to the extent possible, with a provision which accomplishes the original business purposes of the provision in a valid and enforceable manner, and the remainder of this Agreement will remain unaffected and in full force provided, however, that if without such invalid or unenforceable provision the fundamental mutual objectives of the parties cannot be achieved, either party may terminate this Agreement without penalty by written notice to the other.

   5.10. Interest. Any overdue amounts payable hereunder will bear interest, payable on demand (whether before or after judgment), from due date to date of payment, at an annual rate of two percent (2%) above the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect on the due date or, if lower, the maximum rate permitted by applicable law.
