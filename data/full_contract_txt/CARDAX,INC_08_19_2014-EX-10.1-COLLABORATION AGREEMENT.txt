    8.3 Indemnification Process. If CARDAX, Affiliates or their respective employees, servants or agents, or CAPSUGEL, its Affiliates or their respective employees, servants or agents (in each case an "Indemnified Party"), receive any written claim which such Indemnified Party believes is the subject of indemnity hereunder by the other Party hereto (an "Indemnifying Party"), the Indemnified Party shall, as soon as reasonably practicable after forming such belief, give notice thereof to the Indemnifying Party, provided that the failure to give timely notice to the Indemnifying Party as contemplated hereby shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any liability to the Indemnified Party unless the Indemnifying Party demonstrates that the defense of such claim is prejudiced by such failure. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, by prompt notice to the Indemnified Party to assume the defense of such claim at its cost, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party does not so assume the defense of such claim or, having done so, does not diligently pursue such defense, the Indemnified Party may assume the defense, with counsel of its choice, but at the cost of the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party so assumes the defense, it shall have absolute control of the litigation; the Indemnified Party may, nevertheless, participate therein through counsel of its choice and at its cost. The Party not assuming the defense of any such claim shall render all reasonable assistance to the Party assuming such defense, and out-of-pocket costs of such assistance shall be for the account of the Indemnifying Party. No such claim shall be settled other than by the Party defending the same, and then only with the consent of the other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided that the Indemnified Party shall have no obligation to consent to any settlement of any such claim which (i) imposes on the Indemnified Party any liability or obligation which cannot be assumed or performed in full by the Indemnifying Party, (ii) does not unconditionally release the Indemnified Party, (iii) does require a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates or (iv) does impose any restrictions on the conduct of business by the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates.   8.4 Limitation of Damages.  IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OR LOST PROFITS ARISING UNDER OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT. Except in the event of (i) a Party's gross negligence or willful misconduct and/or (ii) a Party's breach of its confidentiality obligation, the total liability of one Party to the other Party (and its Affiliates) arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the Products, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), statute or otherwise, shall, to the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law, be limited to the amount of revenues it receives under this Agreement.   8.5 Insurance. During the Term and for a period of two (2) years after the termination of the Agreement or the expiry date of the last batch manufactured whichever is later, thereafter, each Party shall obtain and maintain, at its sole expense adequate product liability insurance for the Product as it reasonably deems necessary and appropriate. Evidence of coverage, in the form of certificates of insurance, shall be provided promptly upon registration of the Product in given countries and as reasonably requested thereafter.

The failure of either Party to terminate this Agreement by reason of the breach of any of its provisions by the other Party shall not be construed as a waiver of the rights or remedies available for any subsequent breach of the terms and provisions of this Agreement.   10.7 Property. In the event of termination of this Agreement for whatever cause, in addition to the other obligations of the Parties hereunder, each Party shall return to the other Party or to the other Party's designee no later than thirty (30) days after the effective date of termination all of such other Party's property, including all proprietary information, in its possession, except to the extent required to be retained by law or to comply with such Party's continuing obligations hereunder.   10.8 Survival.
