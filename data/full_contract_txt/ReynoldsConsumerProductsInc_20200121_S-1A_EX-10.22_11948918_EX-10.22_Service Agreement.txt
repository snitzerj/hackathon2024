Notwithstanding the content of Exhibit A, RGHI agrees to consider in good faith any reasonable request by the Company for access to any additional service that is necessary for the operation of the Business, at fees to be agreed upon after good faith negotiation between the parties. RGHI will not be in in breach of this Agreement if RGHI declines to provide a requested additional service for any good faith reason, including the failure of the Parties to agree to the scope, term, and fee for the additional service. Any such additional services so provided by RGHI shall constitute Services hereunder and be subject in all respects to the provisions of this Agreement as if fully set forth on Exhibit A as of the date hereof.

RGHI and RCP shall work together in good faith to develop a detailed plan for migrating RCP's IT systems, data, records and processes to its IT environment or infrastructure (the "Migration Plan").

Section 2.2 Performance by Affiliates or Subcontractors. Either Party may, in its sole discretion, engage, or cause one of their Affiliates to engage, one or more parties (including other third parties or Affiliates) to provide some or all of the Services; provided, (i) such Party is using such Affiliate or third party to perform the same Services for itself and its Affiliates (to the extent applicable), (ii) such arrangement would not increase the cost to Recipient for such Services, and (iii) if such third party is not already engaged with respect to such Service as of the date hereof, Provider shall obtain the prior written consent of Recipient (not to be unreasonably withheld). Provider shall (x) be responsible for the performance or non-performance of any such parties and (y) in all cases remain responsible for ensuring that obligations with respect to the standards of Services set forth in Article III of this Agreement are satisfied with respect to any Services provided by such Affiliate or third party.

Section 2.3 Scope of Services. Other than as expressly set forth on Exhibit A, Section 2.1, Exhibit B, or as agreed by the Parties in writing, in no event shall Provider be obligated to provide any Service to the Recipient for any purpose other than to facilitate, on a transitional basis, the Recipient's ability to conduct business as conducted immediately preceding the date hereof.

Section 2.4 Internal Controls and Procedures. In addition to the requirements of Article III and Article VII herein, with respect to the Services provided by RGHI and its Affiliates providing Services hereunder, certain of the Services may involve processes that directly or indirectly support financial information that the Company includes within its consolidated financial reports. The Company has an obligation to ensure that it has internal controls over financial reporting that comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and must also ensure that its external auditors can complete their necessary evaluation of the Company's internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with auditing standards issued by the U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. The Company and RGHI and such Affiliates shall use reasonable commercial efforts to agree (i) what key controls over financial reporting will be performed by RGHI and such Affiliates within the processes that directly or indirectly support financial information that the Company includes within its consolidated financial reports; (ii) the frequency as to the performance of the agreed key controls; and (iii) the form of documentation required to evidence the effective performance of the agreed key controls. RGHI and such Affiliates will perform the agreed key controls and evidence such performance in the agreed format.

Company shall pay or reimburse all of RGHI's expenses and costs arising from such audit. The performance of the agreed key controls, preparation of documentation, providing access to the Company or its delegate and the Company's auditors will be billed at the agreed rates as set forth on Exhibit A.

ARTICLE III SERVICE LEVELS; SERVICE COORDINATORS; TSA COMMITTEE

Section 3.1 Quality of Services.

(a) Provider shall perform the Services (i) at a level of quality substantially similar in all material respects to that at which such Services were performed or enjoyed during the twelve (12) month period prior to the date hereof and (ii) in accordance with applicable Law (collectively, (i) and (ii), the "Service Standard"). Subject to Section 3.1(c), internal controls of Provider and its Affiliates with respect to the Service Standard shall remain materially the same in effect throughout the term of this Agreement. Each Party acknowledges that the other Party and their Affiliates are not professional service providers of the Services.

(b) In the event of any material failure of a Provider to perform the Services, as applicable, in accordance with the Service Standards, Recipient shall provide Provider with written notice of such material failure, and Provider will use commercially reasonable efforts to remedy such failure as soon as reasonably possible and in the same manner that Provider would remedy such a failure for their other businesses undergoing such a material failure.

(c) A Provider may, from time to time: (i) reasonably supplement, modify, upgrade, substitute or otherwise alter ("Change") any Service in a manner consistent with Changes made with respect to similar services provided by Provider on their own behalf or to their Affiliates, including taking any physical or information security measures with respect to such Service, in a manner that does not (x) adversely affect in any material respect the quality or availability of such Service or (y) materially increase the fees payable in connection with such Changed Service; provided that to the extent that any such Change is reasonably likely to modify, substitute or otherwise alter the receipt or use of such Service, Provider shall provide Recipient with reasonable advance written notice of the implementation of the Change to the extent practicable under the circumstances; provided, further, that the Service Standard shall continue to apply to such Service following any Change. If a Change is required by applicable Law or is in response to a threatened Security Incident, Provider may make any and all changes to the Service necessary to comply with applicable Law and any changes thereto or to respond to such threatened Security Incident in a manner consistent with responses made by Provider on its own behalf or in respect of their Affiliates; provided that Provider shall provide Recipient such reasonable advance written notice of the implementation of any such Change as may be practicable under the circumstances; and (ii) with reasonable advance written notice to Recipient, temporarily suspend the provision of a Service as necessary to conduct Systems maintenance or patching without such suspension constituting a breach of the Service Standard.

(d) A Provider need not provide any Service if it is not permitted to do so by applicable Law. To the extent that any Service is not permitted pursuant to applicable Law, the Parties will cooperate in good faith to enter into arrangements reasonably acceptable to each of the Parties under which the Recipient would obtain the benefit of such Service to the same extent (or as nearly as practicable) as if such Service were permitted by applicable Law.

Section 3.2 Policies. Each Party shall, and shall cause any of its Affiliates or third parties providing or receiving Services (as the case may be) to, follow the reasonable policies, procedures and practices of the other Party and its Affiliates applicable to the Services that are known or made known to such Party. A failure of a Recipient to act in accordance with this Section 3.2 that prevents a Provider from providing a Service hereunder shall, upon reasonable advance written notice to the Recipient (where practicable), relieves Provider of its obligations under the Service until such time as the failure has been cured.

Section 3.3 Service Coordinators and Dispute Resolution.

(a) RGHI and Company shall each nominate a representative to act as the primary contact person with respect to the performance of the Services (each, a "Service Coordinator"). Unless otherwise agreed upon by the Parties, the Parties shall direct all initial communications relating to this Agreement and the Services to the Service Coordinators. The initial Service Coordinators for RGHI and Company, including their contact information, are set forth on Exhibit C. Either Party may replace its Service Coordinator at any time by providing notice and contact information for the newly designated Service Coordinator in accordance with Section 10.5. The Service Coordinators shall oversee the implementation and ongoing operation of this Agreement. The Parties shall ensure that their respective Service Coordinators shall meet in person or telephonically at such times as are reasonably requested by RGHI or Company to review and discuss the status of, and any issues arising in connection with, the Services or this Agreement.

(b) In the event a dispute arises between the Parties under this Agreement, telephonic negotiations shall be conducted between the Parties' respective Service Coordinators within ten (10) days following a written request from any Party ("Dispute Negotiations"). If the Service Coordinators are unable to resolve the dispute within ten (10) days after the Parties have commenced Dispute Negotiations, then either RGHI or the Company, by written request to the other Party, may request that such dispute be referred for resolution to the respective presidents (or similar position) of the divisions implicated by the matter for the Parties, or more senior executive of a Party if such Party so designates, which presidents (or other executives) will have fifteen (15) days to resolve such dispute. If the presidents of the relevant divisions (or other executives) for each Party do not agree to a resolution of such dispute within fifteen (15) days after the reference of the matter to them, or if the dispute is not otherwise resolved in a friendly manner as set forth in this Section 3.3, then any unresolved dispute may be resolved pursuant to Section 10.8.

Except to the extent required to meet the Service Standards, in providing the Services, the Parties are not obligated to: (i) hire any additional employees; (ii) maintain the employment of any specific employee; (iii) purchase, lease or license any additional equipment or software; or (iv) make any capital investment to provide or continue providing the Services. The Parties have no responsibility to verify the correctness of any information given to them on behalf of the other Party for the purposes of providing the Services.

Section 3.5 Third Party Licenses and Consents. The Parties will cooperate and assist each other, and use commercially reasonable efforts, to obtain, or direct its Affiliates to obtain, any third party consents required under the terms of any agreement between a Party or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and a third party, on the other hand, in order for a Party or its Affiliates to provide the Services during the Term. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the provision of any Service as contemplated by this Agreement requires the consent, license or approval of any third party not previously obtained, the Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts, to obtain as promptly as possible after the Commencement Date, any third party consents, permits, licenses and approvals required under the terms of any third party agreement in order for Provider to provide the Services hereunder. The cost of obtaining any consent, permit, license or approval with respect to any Service shall be borne by the Recipient of the relevant Services. If any such consent, permit, license or approval is not obtained, the Parties will cooperate in good faith to enter into reasonably acceptable arrangements under which Recipient would obtain the benefit of such Service to the same extent (or as nearly as practicable) as if such consent were obtained (at Recipient's cost), and each Party will continue to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any such required consent or amendment. The Parties acknowledge that it may not be practical to try to anticipate and identify every possible legal, regulatory, and logistical impediment to the provision of Services hereunder. Accordingly, each Party will promptly notify the other Party if it reasonably determines that there is a legal, regulatory, or logistical impediment to the provision of any Service, and the Parties shall each use commercially reasonable efforts to overcome such impediments so that the Services may be provided otherwise in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. All computer systems or software ("Systems"), data, facilities and other resources owned by a Party, its Affiliates or third parties used in connection with the provision or receipt of the Services, as applicable, shall remain the property of such Party, its Affiliates or third parties.

Provider and Recipient shall each use its commercially reasonable efforts consistent with its past practices to prevent the introduction or coding of viruses or similar items into the Systems of the other Party. Without limiting the rights and remedies of any party hereunder, in the event a virus or similar item is introduced into the Systems of a Party, whether or not such introduction is attributable to the other Party (including such other Party's failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement), the other Party shall, as soon as practicable, use its commercially reasonable efforts to assist such Party in reducing the effects of the virus or similar item, and if the virus or similar item causes a loss of operational efficiency or loss of data, upon such Party's request, work as soon as practicable to contain and remedy the problem and to restore lost data resulting from such introduction.
