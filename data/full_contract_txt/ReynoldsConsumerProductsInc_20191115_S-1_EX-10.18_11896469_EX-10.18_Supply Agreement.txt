3. Standard Operating Procedures. Over approximately the past eight years, the Parties have been supplying select Products to one another for use in the operation of their respective businesses within the United States of America, Canada and Mexico. The Parties developed and been following certain standard operating procedures in connecting with, among other topics, forecasting, production planning, ordering, delivering and resolving claims on the Products supplied to one another (the "Current SOPs"). The Parties will be updating their respective business systems over the next six months, and the updates to these business systems will require the Parties to modify the Current SOPs. Once the Parties have completed the updates to the business systems and agreed on the necessary modifications to the Current SOPs, the Parties will sign a written amendment to this Agreement appending the updated standard operating procedures (the "Updated SOPs"). Until the Parties have signed a written amendment appending the Updated SOPs, the parties will continue to follow the Current SOPs. The Parties will comply with the applicable SOPs in connection with the purchase and sale of products identified in a Purchase Schedule. The Parties may add terms and conditions to, and amend the terms and conditions of, the SOP in a Purchase Schedule, but any additional and amended terms and conditions in a Purchase Schedule supplementing and modifying the SOP will only apply the specific products identified in that Purchase Schedule for its duration.

4. Order and Priority of Interpretation. In the event of any conflict, inconsistency or ambiguity between two or more provisions in this Agreement, including the provisions in its Exhibits and Purchase Schedules, the provisions in the documents will govern, supersede and control over one another in the following order of priority: (1st) a Purchase Schedule with regards to the purchase and sale of the specific products identified in that Purchase Schedule for its duration; (2nd) the SOP; (3rd) any Exhibit to this Agreement but only with regards to specific subject matter of the Exhibit; and (4t h) the main body of this Agreement prior to the signature page.

A Party will promptly notify the other Party of any change in circumstance during the Term in which the Party is no longer in compliance with the foregoing general representations, warranties and covenants. An incident of actual, alleged or suspected non-compliance by a Party with a warranty under this Section being investigated, contested or corrected in good faith by the Party and which, regardless of outcome, will have no material adverse effect on the Party or its performance under this Agreement or on the other Party, will not be considered a breach of this clause.

(2) provide information and cooperation reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party in the investigation, defense, settlement and satisfaction of the Indemnified Claim. An Indemnifying Party will reimburse the Indemnified Party of any reasonable, actual, substantiated out-of-pocket expense incurred in providing the requested information or cooperation. e.

(3) Provide information reasonably requested by the Indemnified Party regarding the investigation, defense, settlement and satisfaction of the Indemnified Claim f. An Indemnifying Party, acting in good faith, may settle an Indemnified Claim for which it is responsible under this Agreement involving infringement on the intellectual property of a third-party by: (1) obtaining a license from the third-party allowing the required use of its intellectual property; (2) modifying a product, equipment or process in a manner which avoids infringing on the intellectual property of the third-party; or (3) voluntarily withdrawing the infringing product from the market and either refunding the amount paid by the Indemnified Party for the infringing product or replacing the infringing product with a non-infringing product. g. The Parties may disagree on whether a claim is an Indemnified Claim under this Agreement, which Party should be considered the Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party for an Indemnified Claim or whether each Party is partially liable for an Indemnified Claim and how liability for such an Indemnified Claim should be allocated between them. In these and other circumstances in which an actual or potential conflict of interest exists or arises between the Parties with regards to an alleged or agreed upon Indemnified Claim that would preclude their joint representation by a single defense counsel, the Parties will endeavor in good faith to attempt to resolve the conflict. If the Parties are able to resolve the actual or potential conflict of interest, the Parties will memorialize the agreed upon resolution in a written joint defense agreement signed by officers of each Party and their joint defense counsel. If the Parties are unable to resolve the actual or potential conflict of interest, each Party may independently and separately investigate, defend, settle and satisfy the claim subject to their right to pursue payment or reimbursement for costs incurred in doing so from the other Party as provided in this Agreement.

Exclusion of Indirect Damages; Waiver of Claim for Insured Damage or Loss. A Party that breaches this Agreement will only be liable to the other Party for direct damages arising from the breach. Each Party waives any right to recover consequential, incidental, indirect, exemplary, punitive or any other types of indirect damages from the other Party for a breach of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences, this Subsection will not limit the liability of a Party for any amount or type of damages for: (1) the defense and indemnification of an Indemnified Claim on which the Party is the Indemnifying Party; (2) infringement by the Party on the intellectual property of the other Party; (3) the unauthorized disclosure or use by the Party of the Confidential Information of the other Party; (4) payment or reimbursement of any amount expressly required to be paid or reimbursed by the Party under a provision of this Agreement; or (5) the intentional misconduct of the Party in violation of Applicable Laws. c. Force Majeure. A Party will not be considered in breach of this Agreement or liable to the other Party for any interruption or delay in performance under this Agreement to the extent caused by an event outside of the ability of the performing Party to foresee and avoid with the exercise of commercially reasonable efforts (such an event is referred to at times as an event of "Force Majeure").

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Party will only be excused for an interruption or delay in performance under this Subsection for an event of Force Majeure only if the Party (1) promptly notifies the other Party of the event of Force Majeure and provides information reasonably requested by the other Party regarding the event of Force Majeure, the efforts undertaken by the

During, and while recovering from and restoring performance following, an event of Force Majeure, Seller will act in good faith in allocating its available manufacturing capacity to supply products to Buyer under this Agreement and any products to other customers of Seller. If an event of Force Majeure interrupts or delays Seller from supplying a product to Buyer under this Agreement in the quantities and timetable required by Buyer, Buyer may cancel any unfilled orders for the product with Seller and procure the required quantities of the product from one or more other sources until Seller has recovered from and restored its ability to perform following the event of Force Majeure. If the interruption or delay in the supply of a product to Buyer under this Agreement caused by an event of Force Majeure has exceeded, or is reasonably likely to exceed, thirty (30) days, Buyer may enter into longer term supply agreements or make other arrangements to procure the required quantities of the product from one or more other sources for a duration and on terms acceptable to Buyer in its good faith discretion. In such a circumstance, Buyer will not have to resume purchasing the product from Seller under this Agreement until Seller has recovered from and restored its ability to perform following the event of Force Majeure and the longer term agreements or other arrangements have expired or Buyer is able to end them without liability. This Subsection will not excuse nor extend a deadline by which a Party must pay an amount owed under this Agreement or Applicable Law or by which a Party must exercise any right or remedy under this Agreement or Applicable Law.

A Receiving Party will promptly notify the Disclosing Party if the Receiving Party learns of any unauthorized disclosure or use of the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party by any

(2) The Receiving Party and its Representatives may use the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party for the Authorized Purpose and other limited purposes provided in this Agreement. (3) The Disclosing Party will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Receiving Party and its Representatives against any claim of a third-party that the disclosure and use of the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party as provided in this Agreement infringes on a patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret or other intellectual property of the third-party registered in or otherwise recognized and enforceable under Applicable Laws.

The rights and obligations of the Parties under this Section with regards to disclosed Confidential Information will continue: (1) Until the earlier of (i) sixty (60) months from the date of disclosure to a Receiving Party or (ii) the date such information ceases to be considered Confidential Information under this Agreement, for Confidential Information that is not a trade secret of a Disclosing Party under Applicable Law; and (2) Until Confidential Information that is a trade secret of a Disclosing Party under Applicable Law ceases to be a trade secret of the Disclosing Party under Applicable Law. i.

11. Dispute Resolution. a. Negotiation. If a Party believes that the other Party has breached this Agreement or if there is a dispute between the Parties over the interpretation of this Agreement (a "Dispute"), the Parties will endeavor to resolve the Dispute through good faith negotiation for a period of thirty (30) days after a Party notifies the other Party of the Dispute and before either Party requests mediation or files litigation to resolve the Dispute. b. Mediation. If the Parties have been unable to resolve a Dispute through good faith negotiation as provided in the prior Subsection, a Party may request that the Parties attempt to resolve the Dispute through mediation by notifying the other Party with a copy to JAMS. The Parties will attempt to select a mutually acceptable JAMS mediator within ten (10) days of the notice requesting mediation. The mediation will be held in Lake County or Cook County, Illinois within thirty (30) days of the notice requesting mediation before a JAMS mediator and in compliance with JAMS mediation guidelines. Each party will bear its own costs in preparing for and participating in the mediation and one-half of the fees and expenses charged by JAMS for conducting the mediation. c. Litigation. If the Parties have been unable to resolve a Dispute through mediation as provided in the prior Subsection, a Party may file litigation against the other Party in a court of competent jurisdiction in the United States of America. With respect to litigation involving only the Parties or their Affiliates, the Parties irrevocably consent to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of the U.S. federal and Illinois state courts of competent subject matter jurisdiction located in Lake County, Illinois or Cook County, Illinois and their respective higher courts of appeal for the limited purpose of resolving a Dispute, and the Parties waive, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any defense of inconvenient forum. The Parties waive any right to trial by jury as to any Disputes resolved through litigation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Party may file litigation to resolve a Dispute without undergoing either negotiation or mediation as provided in the prior Subsections for any Dispute involving: (i) infringement on intellectual property; (ii) the unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information; or (iii) a request for a temporary restraining order, a preliminary or permanent injunction or any other type of equitable relief. d. Remedies. Except as expressly limited in the preceding Subsections and the other provisions in this Agreement, a Party may immediately exercise any rights and remedies available to the Party under Applicable Law upon a breach of this Agreement by the other Party. A Party will not suspend performance under or terminate this Agreement or any accepted purchase order for a product being purchased and sold under this Agreement unless: (1) the other Party is in material breach of this Agreement and has either refused to cure the material breach or has failed to cure the material breach within thirty (30) day of its receipt of written notice of the failure; and (2) the Parties have been unable to resolve the Dispute related to the material breach through negotiation or mediation, or the breaching Party has refused or failed to attempt to resolve the Dispute through negotiation or mediation, as provided in this Section. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Party may suspend performance or terminate this Agreement or any accepted purchase order for a product being purchase and sold under this Agreement immediately on written notice to the other Party, and without providing the other Party an opportunity to cure the material breach or attempting to resolve a Dispute over the material breach by negotiation or mediation as provided in this Section, for a material breach by the other Party involving substantial harm to the reputation, goodwill and business of the non-breaching Party that cannot reasonably be avoided or fully redressed by providing the other Party an opportunity to cure the material breach. e. Late Fees and Collection Costs. If Buyer fails to pay Seller an amount owed under this Agreement by the invoice due date, then Buyer will owe Seller: (i) the delinquent amount; and (ii) a late payment fee equal to two percent (2%) of the delinquent amount for each full or partial calendar month past the invoice due date that the delinquent amount remains unpaid. In addition, if Seller has to file

litigation to collect the amount owed and Seller prevails in the litigation, Buyer will reimburse Seller for actual, reasonable, substantiated out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Seller in collecting the delinquent amount and accrued late payment fees on the delinquent amount. Under no circumstance will the late payment fee payable to Seller exceed the amount that a creditor may lawfully impose on a debtor on a delinquent amount under Applicable Law.

12. Miscellaneous. a. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, including its appended Exhibits and Purchase Schedules entered into during the Term, constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the sale of products by Seller to Buyer and the purchase of products by Buyer from Seller. This Agreement supersedes all prior and simultaneous representations, discussions, negotiations, letters, proposals, agreements and understandings, whether written or oral, with respect to this subject matter. This Agreement will not be binding on either Party unless and until signed by the chief executive officers of each Party. No handwritten or other addition, deletion or other modification to the printed portions of this Agreement will be binding upon either Party to this Agreement. b. Amendments. A Party may not amend nor supplement the terms and conditions in this Agreement through the inclusion of additional or different terms and conditions in any quotation, purchase order, invoice, bill of lading, letter, email or other document or communication. This Section does not prevent the reliance on the descriptive information in transaction documents identifying the ordered Products (e.g., the type and quantity of ordered products and scheduled date and location for delivery). No amendment of this Agreement will be valid or effective unless made in writing and signed and exchanged by the chief executive officers of the Parties. A Party may approve or reject a request for an amendment in its sole and absolute discretion. c. Waiver. The failure of either party to insist in any one or more instances upon strict performance of any of the provisions of this Agreement or to take advantage of any of its rights shall not operate as a continuing waiver of such rights. No right or obligation under this Agreement will be considered to have been waived by a Party unless such waiver is in writing and is signed by an officer of the waiving Party and delivered to the other Party. No consent to or waiver of a breach by either Party will constitute a consent to, waiver of, or excuse for any other, different, or subsequent breach by such Party. d. Governing Law. This Agreement and all claims or causes of action arising out of or related to this Agreement shall be governed in all respects, including as to validity, interpretation and effect, by the laws of the State of Illinois and the United States of America, without giving effect to its principles or rules of conflict of laws. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not govern or otherwise be applicable to this Agreement. e. Severability.

Assignment. This Agreement, its rights and obligations, is not assignable or transferable by either Party, in whole or in part, except with the prior written consent of the other Party, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may transfer and assign this Agreement to any of its affiliates or in connection with any merger, consolidation or sale of assets without the other Party's prior consent provided (a) that any such assignment will not result in the assigning Party being released or discharged from any liability under this Agreement, and (b) the purchaser/assignee will expressly assume all obligations of the assigning Party under this Agreement. The assigning Party will provide the other Party with written

A change of control shall be deemed an assignment requiring consent hereunder provided that any transfer or assignment that results in Seller's and Buyer's current common parent, Reynolds Group Holdings Limited, ceasing to control either party shall not require consent of the other party. The restrictions in this Section will not preclude a Party for authorizing an Affiliate to purchase or sell a product on behalf of a Party under this Agreement. Subject to the foregoing, all of the terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the successors and assignees of the respective Parties. g. Third Party Beneficiaries. Except as otherwise provided in a Purchase Schedule, there are no intended third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement. h. Good Faith and Cooperation.
