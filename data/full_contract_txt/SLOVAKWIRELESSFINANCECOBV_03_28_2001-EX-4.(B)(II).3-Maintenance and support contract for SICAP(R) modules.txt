1     Introduction

      Sicap Ltd provides to EuroTel a standard service for the SICAP(R) PPB, VCA       and OTA modules.

      EuroTel can also request additional support which is not part of the       offered standard support and is subject to a separate quotation and       ordering procedure as described in Article 5.

1.1   Standard service

      The following services are included for the SICAP(R) PPB, VCA and OTA       modules

      o     HotLine support (resolving of incidents)

      o     20 hours telephone support (during office hours) per month. This             support includes every necessary support for the SICAP(R) PPB, VCA             and OTA (no accumulation of unused hours)

      o     Remote support via ISDN line (establishment and communication costs             to be paid by customer). Security can be guaranteed under the             following conditions: Firewall, only outgoing connections allowed

      o     Change Management

      The following service is charged:

      o     Installation costs if on-site support is required

      This Maintenance and Support contract does not include the following       cases:

      Bugs or problems in third party software or middleware, like for example       Veritas Cluster, Oracle, not-correct DB-management, faults of EuroTel's       system management, hidden modification and/or "foreign"       developments/adaptations of the SICAP application and/or the entire       prepaid system. Misuse will be charged at cost.

1.2   Over all responsibilities

      EuroTel is responsible for the initial fault tracing within the entire       prepaid system including first level maintenance, Sicap Ltd for second       level maintenance, as described under clause 1.1.

      First level of maintenance means all day by day activities in order to       have the entire prepaid system running under normal condition including       application administration, dB administration and system administration       (hardware & operating system).

      For second level of maintenance are intended all the activities needed to       have the SICAP(R) application running under unexpected conditions like       bugs, unexpected performance limitations, etc. (HW configuration and any       changes to be confirmed by Sicap Ltd)

      The clause 2.2 defines the procedure, which will allow EuroTel to qualify       problems within its own support organisation in order to achieve problem       resolution with Sicap Ltd support.

                                                                    [LOGO] sicap
