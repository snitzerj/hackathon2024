The Compensation Options will be exercisable for a period of 24 months at the Offering Price. Unless otherwise stated herein, the Offered Shares shall also refer to the Compensation Options. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the entire Agents' Fee and Compensation Options payable in respect of Offered Shares sold pursuant to Regulation D under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended, shall be payable to the Lead Agent.

Rights of Termination (a) Regulatory Proceedings Out If, after the date hereof and prior to the Closing Time, any enquiry, action, suit, investigation or other proceeding, whether formal or informal, is instituted or announced or any order is made by any federal, provincial or other Governmental Authority in relation to the Corporation which, in the opinion of any of the Agents, operates to prevent or restrict the distribution or trading of the Offered Shares, then such Agent shall be entitled, at its option and in accordance with Section 10(e), to terminate its obligations under this Agreement by notice to that effect given to the Corporation any time at or prior to the Closing Time. (b) Disaster Out If prior to the Closing Time there should develop, occur or come into effect or existence any event, action, state, condition or major financial occurrence of national or international consequence or any law or regulation which, in the opinion of any of the Agents, seriously adversely affects, or involves, or will seriously adversely affect, or involve, the financial markets or the business, operations or affairs of the Corporation and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, then such Agent shall be entitled, at its option and in accordance with Section 10(e), to terminate its obligations under this Agreement by written notice to that effect given to the Corporation at any time at or prior to the Closing Time. (c) Material Change or Change in Material Fact Out If, after the date hereof and prior to the Closing Time, there shall occur any material change or change in a material fact which, in the reasonable opinion of any of the Agents, would be expected to have a significant adverse effect on the business, affairs, prospects or financial condition of the Corporation and its subsidiaries taken as a whole or the market price or value of the securities of the Corporation, then such Agent shall be entitled, at its option, in accordance with Section 10(e), to terminate its obligations under this Agreement by written notice to that effect given to the Corporation any time at or prior to the Closing Time. (d) Non-Compliance with Conditions The Corporation agrees that all terms and conditions in Section 9 shall be construed as conditions and complied with so far as they relate to acts to be performed or caused to be performed by it, that it will use its best efforts to cause such conditions to be complied with, and that any breach or failure by the Corporation to comply with any such conditions shall entitle any of the Agents, in accordance with Section 10(e), to terminate its obligations under this Agreement by written notice to that effect given to the Corporation at any time at or prior to the Closing Time, unless otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement. Each Agent may waive, in whole or in part, or extend the time for compliance with, any terms and conditions without prejudice to its rights in respect of any other terms and conditions or any other or subsequent breach or non- compliance, provided that any such waiver or extension shall be binding upon an Agent only if such waiver or extension is in writing and signed by the Agent. 20

(e) Exercise of Termination Rights The rights of termination contained in Sections 10(a), (b), (c) and (d) may be exercised by any of the Agents and are in addition to any other rights or remedies any of the Agents may have in respect of any default, act or failure to act or non- compliance by the Corporation in respect of any of the matters contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise. In the event of any such termination, there shall be no further liability on the part of the Agents to the Corporation or on the part of the Corporation to the Agents except in respect of any liability which may have arisen prior to or arise after such termination under Sections 11, 12 and 14. A notice of termination given by an Agent under Section 10(a), (b), (c) or (d) shall not be binding upon any other Agent who has not also executed such notice. 11. Indemnity (a) Rights of Indemnity (1) The Corporation covenants and agrees to protect, indemnify, and save harmless, each of the Agents and their respective affiliates, and each and every one of the directors, officers, employees, partners and agents of the Agents (individually, an "Indemnified Party" and collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") harmless from and against any and all expenses, losses (excluding loss of profits), claims, actions, damages (other than consequential or punitive damages) or liabilities, joint or several (including the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any actions, suits, proceedings or claims and the reasonable fees and expenses of their counsel that may be incurred in advising with respect to and/or defending any claim that may be made against the Indemnified Parties) to which any Indemnified Party may become subject or otherwise involved in any capacity under any statute or common law or otherwise insofar as such expenses, losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions arise out of or are based, directly or indirectly, upon the performance of professional services rendered to the Corporation by the Indemnified Parties (or any of them), whether directly or indirectly, including by reason of: (a) any information or statement contained in this Agreement, the Corporation's publicly available disclosed documents filed on SEDAR or elsewhere, or in any other material prepared by the Corporation used for marketing the Offering or any certificate of the Corporation delivered hereunder or pursuant hereto, which at the time and in the light of the circumstances under which it was made contains or is alleged to contain a misrepresentation or any misstatement of a material fact; 21





(b) the omission or alleged omission to state in in this Agreement, the Corporation's publicly available disclosed documents filed on SEDAR or elsewhere, or in any other material prepared by the Corporation used for marketing the Offering or any certificate of the Corporation delivered hereunder or pursuant hereto, any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make any statement therein not misleading in light of the circumstances in which it was made; (c) any order made, or inquiry, investigation or proceeding commenced by any securities regulatory authority or other competent authority based upon any misrepresentation, untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission in this Agreement, the Corporation's publicly available disclosed documents filed on SEDAR or elsewhere, or in any other material prepared by the Corporation used for marketing the Offering or any certificate of the Corporation delivered hereunder or pursuant hereto that prevents or restricts the trading in any of the Corporation's securities or the distribution or distribution to the public, as the case may be, of any of the Offered Shares in any of the Qualifying Jurisdictions; (d) the Corporation not complying with any requirement of Applicable Securities Laws or stock exchange requirements in connection with the transactions contemplated herein, including the Corporation's non-compliance with any statutory requirement to make any document available for inspection; or (e) any breach of a representation or warranty of the Corporation contained in this Agreement or the failure of the Corporation to comply with any of its obligations hereunder. (2) Notwithstanding Subsection 11(a) (1), the indemnification in Subsection 11(a)(1) does not and shall not apply to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction in a final judgment that has become non- appealable shall determine that (a) the Agents and their respective affiliates have been negligent or have committed any fraudulent or illegal act in the course of the professional services rendered to the Corporation, and (b) such expenses, losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions were caused or incurred by the gross negligence, fraud or wilful misconduct of the Agents. (3) If any matter or thing contemplated by this Section 11 shall be asserted against any Indemnified Party in respect of which indemnification is or might reasonably be considered to be provided, such Indemnified Party will notify the Corporation in writing as soon as possible of the nature of such claim (provided that omission to so notify the Corporation will not relieve the Corporation of any liability that it may otherwise have to the Indemnified Party hereunder, except to the extent the Corporation is materially prejudiced by such omission) and the Corporation shall be entitled (but not required) to assume the defence of any suit brought to enforce such claim; provided, however, that the defence shall be through legal counsel reasonably acceptable to such Indemnified Party and that no settlement may be made by the Corporation or such Indemnified Party without the prior written consent of the other, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. 22





(4) In any such claim, such Indemnified Party shall have the right to retain other legal counsel to act on such Indemnified Party's behalf, provided that the fees and disbursements of such other legal counsel shall be paid by such Indemnified Party, unless: (a) the employment of such counsel has been authorized by the Corporation; or (b) the Corporation has not assumed the defence and employed counsel thereof promptly after receiving notice of such claim; or (c) the named parties to any such claim include both the Indemnified Party and the Corporation, and the Indemnified Party has been advised by legal counsel thereto that representation of both the Corporation and the Indemnified Party by the same legal counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them; or (d) there are one or more defences available to the Indemnified Party which are different from and in addition to those available to the Corporation, provided that the Corporation shall not be responsible for the fees or expenses of more than one legal firm in any single jurisdiction for all of the Indemnified Parties. (5) To the extent that any Indemnified Party is not a party to this Underwriting Agreement, the Agents shall obtain and hold the right and benefit of this Section 11 in trust for and on behalf of such Indemnified Party. (6) The Corporation hereby consents to personal jurisdiction in any court in which any claim that is subject to indemnification hereunder is brought against the Agents or any Indemnified Party and to the assignment of the benefit of this Section 11 to any Indemnified Party for the purpose of enforcement provided that nothing herein shall limit the Corporation's right or ability to contest the appropriate jurisdiction or forum for the determination of any such claims. (7) The rights of the Corporation contained in this Section 11 shall not enure to the benefit of any Indemnified Party if the Agents were provided with a copy of any amendment or supplement to this Agreement which corrects any untrue statement or omission or alleged omission that is the basis of a claim by a party against such Indemnified Party and that is required, under the Applicable Securities Laws, to be delivered to such party by the Agents. (8) The Corporation shall not be liable under this Section 11 for any settlement of any claim or action effected without its prior written consent. 23





(b) Notification of Claims If any matter or thing contemplated by Section 11(a) (any such matter or thing being referred to as a "Claim") is asserted against any person or company in respect of which indemnification is or might reasonably be considered to be provided, such person or company (the "Indemnified Party") will notify the Corporation as soon as possible of the nature of such Claim (but the omission so to notify the Corporation of any potential Claim shall not relieve the Corporation from any liability which they may have to any Indemnified Party and any omission so to notify the Corporation of any actual Claim shall affect the Corporation's liability only to the extent that the Corporation is materially prejudiced by that failure). The Corporation shall assume the defence of any suit brought to enforce such Claim, provided, however, that (i) the defence shall be conducted through legal counsel acceptable to the Indemnified Party, acting reasonably, and (ii) no settlement of any such Claim or admission of liability may be made by the Corporation without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, acting reasonably, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of the Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or failure to act, by or on behalf of any Indemnified Party. (c) Right of Indemnity in Favour of Others With respect to any Indemnified Party who is not a party to this Agreement, the Agents shall obtain and hold the rights and benefits of this Section 11 in trust for and on behalf of such Indemnified Party. (d) Retaining Counsel In any such Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to retain one separate counsel to act on his or its behalf, provided that the fees and disbursements of such counsel shall be paid by the Indemnified Party unless: (i) the Corporation and the Indemnified Party shall have mutually agreed in writing to the retention of the other counsel; (ii) the named parties to any such Claim (including any added third or impleaded party) include both the Indemnified Party and the Corporation and the Indemnified Party shall have been advised in writing by counsel to the Indemnified Party that the representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to an actual or potential conflict of interest between the Corporation and the Indemnified Party; or (iii) the Corporation shall not have retained counsel within seven Business Days following receipt by the Corporation of notice of any such Claim from the Indemnified Party; provided that the Corporation shall not be responsible for the fees or expenses of more than one legal firm in any single jurisdiction for all of the Indemnified Parties. 24





12. Contribution (a) Rights of Contribution In order to provide for a just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnity provided in Section 11 would otherwise be available in accordance with its terms but is, for any reason, held to be unavailable to or unenforceable by the Agents or enforceable otherwise than in accordance with its terms, the Corporation and the Agents shall contribute to the aggregate of all claims, expenses, costs and liabilities and all losses (other than loss of profits) of a nature contemplated by Section 11 in such proportions so that the Agents shall be responsible for the portion represented by the percentage that the aggregate Agents' Fee hereunder bears to the aggregate offering price of the Offered Shares being sold by the Corporation and the Corporation shall be responsible for the balance, whether or not they have been sued together or sued separately, provided, however, that (i) the Agents shall not in any event be liable to contribute, in the aggregate, any amounts in excess of the aggregate Agents' Fee actually received by the Agents from the Corporation under this Agreement; (ii) each Agent shall not in any event be liable to contribute, individually, any amount in excess of such Agents' portion of the aggregate Agents' Fee actually received from the Corporation under this Agreement; and (iii) no party who has engaged in any fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation, wilful misconduct or negligence shall be entitled to claim contribution from any person who has not engaged in such fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation, wilful misconduct or negligence. (b) Rights of Contribution in Addition to Other Rights The rights to contribution provided in this Section 12 shall be in addition to and not in derogation of any other right to contribution which the Agents may have by statute or otherwise at law. (c) Right of Contribution in Favour of Others With respect to this Section 12, the Corporation acknowledges and agrees that the Agents are contracting on their own behalf and as agents for their affiliates, directors, officers, employees and agents. For purposes of this Section 12, each person, if any, who controls an Agent within the meaning of Section 15 of the U.S. Securities Act or Section 20 of the U.S. Exchange Act and each Agents' affiliates and selling agents shall have the same rights to contribution as such Agent and each person, if any, who controls the Corporation within the meaning of Section 15 of the U.S. Securities Act or Section 20 of the U.S. Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Corporation. The Agents' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 12 are several in proportion to the percentages of Agents' Fee set forth opposite their respective names in Section 5(a) hereof and not joint. 25





(d) Remedy Not Exclusive The remedies provided for in this Section 12 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any party at law or in equity. 13. Severability If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be void or unenforceable in whole or in part, it shall be deemed not to affect or impair the validity of any other provision of this Agreement and such void or unenforceable provision shall be severable from this Agreement. 14. Expenses (a) Whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be completed, all expenses of or incidental to the issue, sale and delivery of the Offered Shares and all expenses of or incidental to all other matters in connection with the offering of the Offered Shares shall be borne by the Corporation including, without limitation, all fees and disbursements of all legal counsel to the Corporation (including U.S., foreign and local counsel), all fees and disbursements of the Corporation's accountants and auditors, all expenses related to road shows and marketing activities, all printing costs incurred in connection with the offering of the Offered Shares, including certificates, if any, representing the Offered Shares, all filing fees, all fees and expenses relating to listing the Offered Shares on any exchanges, all transfer agent fees and expenses, and all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the Agents incurred in connection with the offering of the Offered Shares, including without limitation the fees of Canadian counsel to the Agents which shall not exceed $50,000 (not including applicable taxes and disbursements and $10,000 USD plus tax and disbursements for U.S. Counsel), and any advertising, printing, courier, telecommunications, data search, presentation, travel and other expenses incurred by the Agents together with all related taxes (including, without limitation, provincial sales taxes and HST). (b) All expenses payable by the Corporation to the Agent in accordance with this Agreement shall be payable whether or not the Offering is completed. 15. Survival of Representations and Warranties The representations, warranties, obligations and agreements of the Corporation contained in this Agreement and in any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement or in connection with the purchase and sale of the Offered Shares shall survive the payment by the Agents for the Offered Shares, if any, and the distribution of the Offered Shares, and shall continue in full force and effect unaffected by the termination of the Agents' obligations and shall not be limited or prejudiced by any investigation made by or on behalf of the Agents in connection with the distribution of the Offered Shares. 26
