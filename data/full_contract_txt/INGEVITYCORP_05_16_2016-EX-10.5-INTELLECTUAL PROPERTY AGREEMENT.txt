  -6-







  in writing, the transfer or assignment to the SpinCo Group of such SpinCo IP Assets or the assumption by the SpinCo Group of such SpinCo IP Liabilities, as the case may be, shall be automatically deemed deferred and any such purported transfer, assignment or assumption shall be null and void until such time as all legal impediments are removed or such Approvals or Notifications have been obtained or made. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such SpinCo IP Assets or SpinCo IP Liabilities shall continue to constitute SpinCo IP Assets and SpinCo IP Liabilities for all other purposes of this Agreement.   (c) Treatment of Delayed SpinCo IP Assets and Delayed SpinCo IP Liabilities. If any transfer or assignment of any SpinCo IP Asset (or a portion thereof) or any assumption of any SpinCo IP Liability (or a portion thereof) intended to be transferred, assigned or assumed hereunder, as the case may be, is not consummated on or prior to the Effective Time, whether as a result of the provisions of Section 2.3(b) or for any other reason (any such SpinCo IP Asset (or a portion thereof), a "Delayed SpinCo IP Asset" and any such SpinCo IP Liability (or a portion thereof), a "Delayed SpinCo IP Liability"), then, insofar as reasonably possible and subject to applicable Law, the member of the Parent Group retaining such Delayed SpinCo IP Asset or such Delayed SpinCo IP Liability, as the case may be, shall thereafter hold such Delayed SpinCo IP Asset or Delayed SpinCo IP Liability, as the case may be, for the use and benefit of the member of the SpinCo Group entitled thereto (at the expense of the member of the SpinCo Group entitled thereto). In addition, the member of the Parent Group retaining such Delayed SpinCo IP Asset or such Delayed SpinCo IP Liability shall, insofar as reasonably possible and to the extent permitted by applicable Law, treat such Delayed SpinCo IP Asset or Delayed SpinCo IP Liability in the ordinary course of business in accordance with past practice and take such other actions as may be reasonably requested by the member of the SpinCo Group to whom such Delayed SpinCo IP Asset is to be transferred or assigned, or which will assume such Delayed SpinCo IP Liability, as the case may be, in order to place such member of the SpinCo Group in a substantially similar position as if such Delayed SpinCo IP Asset or Delayed SpinCo IP Liability had been transferred, assigned or assumed as contemplated hereby and so that all the benefits and burdens relating to such Delayed SpinCo IP Asset or Delayed SpinCo IP Liability, as the case may be, including use, non- abandonment, avoidance from contribution to the public domain, risk of loss, potential for gain, and dominion, control and command over such Delayed SpinCo IP Asset or Delayed SpinCo IP Liability, as the case may be, and all costs and expenses related thereto, shall inure from and after the Effective Time to the SpinCo Group.   (d) Transfer of Delayed SpinCo IP Assets and Delayed SpinCo IP Liabilities. If and when the Approvals or Notifications, the absence of which caused the deferral of transfer or assignment of any Delayed SpinCo IP Asset or the deferral of assumption of any Delayed SpinCo IP Liability pursuant to  Section 2.3(b), are obtained or made, and, if and when any other legal or other impediments for the transfer or assignment of any Delayed SpinCo IP Asset or the assumption of any Delayed SpinCo IP Liability have been removed, the transfer or assignment of the applicable Delayed SpinCo IP Asset or the assumption of the applicable Delayed SpinCo IP Liability, as the case may be, shall be effected in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and/or the applicable Ancillary Agreement as soon as reasonably practicable.   (e) Costs for Delayed SpinCo IP Assets and Delayed SpinCo IP Liabilities. Any member of the Parent Group retaining a Delayed SpinCo IP Asset or a Delayed SpinCo IP Liability due to the deferral of the transfer or assignment of such Delayed SpinCo IP Asset or the

  -7-







  deferral of the assumption of such Delayed SpinCo IP Liability, as the case may be, shall not be obligated, in connection with the foregoing, to expend any money unless the necessary funds are advanced (or otherwise made available) by SpinCo or the member of the SpinCo Group entitled to the Delayed SpinCo IP Asset or Delayed SpinCo IP Liability, other than reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, attorneys' fees and recording or similar fees, all of which shall be promptly reimbursed by SpinCo or the member of the SpinCo Group entitled to such Delayed SpinCo IP Asset or Delayed SpinCo IP Liability.   2.4 Novation of SpinCo IP Liabilities.   (a) Each of Parent and SpinCo, at the request of the other, shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, or to cause to be obtained, as soon as reasonably practicable, any consent, substitution, approval or amendment required to novate or assign all SpinCo IP Liabilities and obtain in writing the unconditional release of each member of the Parent Group that is a party to any such arrangements, so that, in any such case, the members of the SpinCo Group shall be solely responsible for such SpinCo IP Liabilities; provided, however, that, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements, neither Parent nor SpinCo shall be obligated to contribute any capital or pay any consideration in any form (including providing any letter of credit, guaranty or other financial accommodation) to any third Person from whom any such consent, substitution, approval, amendment or release is requested.   (b)  If Parent or SpinCo is unable to obtain, or to cause to be obtained, any such required consent, substitution, approval, amendment or release as set forth in Section 2.4(a) and the applicable member of the Parent Group continues to be bound by such agreement, lease, license or other obligation or Liability (each, an "Unreleased SpinCo IP Liability"), SpinCo shall, to the extent not prohibited by Law, as indemnitor, guarantor, agent or subcontractor for such member of the Parent Group, as the case may be, (i) pay, perform and discharge fully all the obligations or other Liabilities of such member of the Parent Group that constitute Unreleased SpinCo IP Liabilities from and after the Effective Time and (ii) use its commercially reasonable efforts to effect such payment, performance or discharge prior to any demand for such payment, performance or discharge is permitted to be made by the obligee thereunder on any member of the Parent Group. If and when any such consent, substitution, approval, amendment or release shall be obtained or the Unreleased SpinCo IP Liabilities shall otherwise become assignable or able to be novated, Parent shall promptly assign, or cause to be assigned, and SpinCo or the applicable SpinCo Group member shall assume, such Unreleased SpinCo IP Liabilities without exchange of further consideration.   2.5 Disclaimer of Representations and Warranties. EACH OF PARENT (ON BEHALF OF ITSELF AND EACH MEMBER OF THE PARENT GROUP) AND SPINCO (ON BEHALF OF ITSELF AND EACH MEMBER OF THE SPINCO GROUP) UNDERSTANDS AND AGREES THAT, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH HEREIN OR IN THE SEPARATION AGREEMENT, NO PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT OR OTHERWISE, IS REPRESENTING OR WARRANTING IN ANY WAY AS TO THE ASSETS, BUSINESSES OR LIABILITIES TRANSFERRED OR ASSUMED AS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY, AS TO ANY CONSENTS OR APPROVALS REQUIRED IN CONNECTION THEREWITH, AS TO THE VALUE OR FREEDOM FROM ANY SECURITY INTERESTS

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, SpinCo hereby grants to each individual member of the Parent Group, on behalf of itself and the other members of the SpinCo Group, and shall cause the other members of the SpinCo Group to grant to each individual member of the Parent Group, a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid-up, royalty-free right and license, for use in the Parent Field, to (i) use, reproduce, distribute, display, perform, make Improvements and exploit the Licensed SpinCo IP, and (ii) make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell and import any goods and services incorporating, embodying or utilizing the Licensed SpinCo IP. The foregoing license shall be transferable or sublicensable by Parent Group solely to a Permitted Party, and, subject to the restrictions herein, with any sale or transfer of a Parent business that utilizes the Licensed SpinCo IP. Any such transfer or sublicense shall require the Permitted Party or, in the case of a sale or transfer of a Parent business, the transferee, to agree pursuant to a written agreement to maintain any trade secrets and Information included in the Licensed SpinCo IP in strict confidence. Such agreement shall prohibit any further sublicensing or transfer of rights by the Permitted Party, or, in the case of a sale or transfer of a Parent business, the transferee, or any use of the Licensed SpinCo IP outside the scope of the license granted to Parent herein. Parent shall remain responsible and liable for the Permitted Parties' exercise of any rights sublicensed hereunder and any use of the Licensed SpinCo IP by such Permitted Party outside of the permitted scope of the license. Parent shall enforce material breaches of the terms of any such sublicense of rights and notify SpinCo of any material violation thereof by a Permitted Party. If Parent enters an agreement to transfer the license granted to it under this Section 3.1 in connection with any sale or transfer of a Parent business, then SpinCo and members of the SpinCo Group shall be made third party beneficiaries under such transfer agreement to enforce breaches of the license.   3.2 License Grant to SpinCo.

Such license shall be transferrable subject to the foregoing restriction with any sale or transfer of a SpinCo business that utilizes such Intellectual Property, but, for the avoidance of doubt, such license shall not otherwise be sublicensable or transferable. Any transfer by SpinCo or a member of its Group shall require the transferee to agree pursuant to a written agreement to maintain any trade secrets and Information included in the transferred Intellectual Property in strict confidence. Such agreement shall prohibit any further transfer of rights by such party or any use of the transferred Intellectual Property outside the scope of the license granted to SpinCo herein. If SpinCo enters an agreement to transfer the license granted to it under this  Section 3.2  in connection with any sale or transfer of a SpinCo business, then Parent and members of the Parent Group shall be made third party beneficiaries under such transfer agreement to enforce breaches of the license.   3.3 Neither Party shall make a trade secret of the other Party public or otherwise destroy or impair the trade secret status of such trade secret without the express, advance, written consent of the other Party.

The Party that is not the Enforcing Party (the "Non-Enforcing Party") shall, to the extent it is a necessary party to the IP Action (or is otherwise reasonably requested by the enforcing Party), join the Enforcing Party (and/or, if applicable, its designee(s)) at the Enforcing Party's expense and agree to be represented by counsel for the Enforcing Party in any infringement or other IP Action commenced by the Enforcing Party (or its designee) and shall, upon request of the Enforcing Party, execute such documents and perform such other acts as may be reasonably required and requested by the Enforcing Party at the Enforcing Party's expense in connection with such enforcement IP Action;  provided, that the Non-Enforcing Party shall have the right to engage, at its cost and expense, independent counsel of its choice to advise such Non-Enforcing Party in connection with such assistance to the Enforcing Party.   (ii) The Non-Enforcing Party shall cooperate with, and provide reasonable assistance to, the Enforcing Party (and its designees) in connection with any IP Action brought by the Enforcing Party (or its designee) hereunder to the extent relating to the Licensed SpinCo IP, as may be reasonably requested by the Enforcing Party, including by providing access to relevant documents and other evidence (provided that the Parties shall enter into a joint defense agreement with respect to the common interest privilege protecting such communications in a form reasonably acceptable to the Parties) and making its employees available, subject to the other Party's reimbursement of any costs and expenses incurred by the Non-Enforcing Party in providing such assistance. The Enforcing Party shall keep the Non-Enforcing Party reasonably informed of any determinations or significant developments in any IP Action initiated by it pursuant to this Section 3.6 and, if the Non-Enforcing Party is SpinCo, then the Parent shall reasonably consult with the SpinCo and take into consideration input provided to Parent by SpinCo to the extent reasonable and provided in a timely manner.

  damages or other monetary awards ("Recoveries") recovered in any IP Action by the Enforcing Party, itself or through its designee, pursuant to this Section 3.6, whether by judgment or settlement, shall be allocated in the following order: (A) to reimburse the Enforcing Party for any costs and expenses incurred by or on behalf of the Enforcing Party and/or its designee(s) with respect to such IP Action, (B) to reimburse the Non-Enforcing Party for any costs and expenses incurred by such Party with respect to such IP Action to the extent the Non-Enforcing Party participated in an IP Action pursuant to this  Section 3.6 (and has not already been reimbursed by the Enforcing Party), including if it joins such IP Action (but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the cost of any counsel employed by the Non-Enforcing Party), and (C) the remainder shall be allocated to the Enforcing Party.   (d) Settlement of Enforcement IP Action. The Enforcing Party shall not settle, or enter into a voluntary consent judgment with respect to, any enforcement IP Action under this Section 3.6 in a manner that would include any admissions of invalidity or unenforceability against the Non-Enforcing Party, or wrongdoing by the Non-Enforcing Party or any of its Group, or imposes any liability or payment or other obligation on the Non-Enforcing Party or any of its Group, without the Non-Enforcing Party's written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and in any event, without notifying the Non-Enforcing Party of any such proposed settlement or voluntary consent judgment. For the avoidance of doubt, and without limiting the foregoing, as between the Parties, the Enforcing Party shall have the sole and exclusive right to settle, or enter into a voluntary consent judgment with respect to, any enforcement IP Action under this Section 3.6. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent shall not settle or enter into a voluntary consent judgment or enter into any other agreement that shall in any way impair the rights of SpinCo with respect to its Intellectual Property outside the Parent Field without SpinCo's consent, which may be withheld in its sole option.   3.7 Bankruptcy. In the event that this Agreement is terminated or rejected by SpinCo, a member of the SpinCo Group or its receiver or trustee under applicable bankruptcy laws due to such Party's bankruptcy, then all rights and licenses granted under or pursuant to this Agreement by SpinCo to Parent are, and shall otherwise be deemed to be, for purposes of Section 365(n) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (the "Code") and any similar laws in any other country, licenses of rights to "intellectual property" as defined under the Code for purposes of Section 365(n). The Parties agree that all intellectual property rights licensed hereunder, including, without limitation, any patents or patent applications in any country of SpinCo or a member of SpinCo Group covered by the license grants under this Agreement, are part of the "intellectual property" as defined under the Code for purposes of Section 365(n) subject to the protections afforded the non-terminating Party under Section 365(n) of the Code, and any similar law or regulation in any other country.   3.8 Trademark Disclaimer. Neither Parent nor SpinCo nor any member of the Parent Group or SpinCo Group grants any right or license to the other to use any Parent Name or Parent Mark or SpinCo Name or SpinCo Mark in any manner including, without limitation, use in commerce as a trade name, trademark or other designation of origin. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is understood that signage, letterhead, invoices, business cards, promotional materials and similar items may reference the Parent Name or Parent Mark "MeadWestvaco" and "MWV" in the same manner as used by SpinCo prior to the Effective Time, during a twelve-month phase out period as SpinCo replaces such Parent Name and Parent Mark with the SpinCo Name and SpinCo Mark.

EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION; CONFIDENTIALITY   5.1 Agreement for Transfer and Exchange of Information.   (a) Each of Parent and SpinCo, on behalf of itself and each member of its Group, acknowledges and agrees that, with respect to Information that it will own as a result of the Separation, each is entitled to physical possession of Information that exists in tangible and intangible form, including Software, Technology, or electronic data that may exist on hard-drives, or other electronic storage means ("Tangible/Intangible Information"). Subject to subsections (i)-(iii) of this Section 5.1(a), each Party agrees that prior to the date that is six (6) months after the Effective Time ("Delivery Date"), it will deliver possession of any Tangible/Intangible Information of the other Party that is in its possession or control to the other Party, without retaining any copies.   (i) To the extent that any Tangible/Intangible Information of SpinCo is in the possession of Parent, is comingled, and separation is not commercially reasonable, Parent will make such Tangible/Intangible Information available to SpinCo to separate at its own expense. If SpinCo chooses to separate such Tangible/Intangible Information, then Parent will deliver possession to SpinCo of any such separated Tangible/Intangible Information within one (1) month after such separation, without retaining any copies.   (ii) To the extent that any Tangible/Intangible Information of Parent is in the possession of SpinCo, is comingled, and separation is not commercially reasonable, SpinCo shall, at its option, (x) separate such comingled Tangible/Intangible Information at its own expense and deliver possession to Parent of any such separated Tangible/Intangible Information by the Delivery Date, without retaining any copies or (y) deliver possession of all of such comingled Tangible/Intangible Information to Parent by the Delivery Date, without retaining any copies.   (iii) To the extent Parent is in possession of any comingled Tangible/Intangible Information, that is not separated by SpinCo pursuant to Section 5.1(a)(i), then Parent shall be entitled to maintain possession of such Tangible/Intangible Information, but (A) shall provide reasonable access to SpinCo upon SpinCo's request, including the opportunity to make extracts or copies, and (B) Parent shall not use or otherwise access that portion of the

  -15-







  comingled Tangible/Intangible Information that is the property of SpinCo, and shall retain such Tangible/Intangible Information in confidence as set forth in the Section 6.9 of the Separation Agreement. To the extent practical, SpinCo shall be entitled to redact or obscure any of SpinCo's Tangible/Intangible Information that is so retained by Parent.   (b) Subject to the applicable confidentiality obligations of the Separation Agreement, each of Parent and SpinCo, on behalf of itself and each member of its Group, agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to provide or make available, or cause to be provided or made available, to the other Party and the members of such other Party's Group, at any time before, on or after the Effective Time, as soon as reasonably practicable after written request therefor, any Information (or a copy thereof) in the possession or under the control of such Party or its Group which the requesting Party or its Group requests, in good faith in order to evaluate or use such Information for commercial purposes within the Parent Field or SpinCo Field, as appropriate, to the extent that (i) such Information relates to any SpinCo IP Asset or SpinCo IP Liability, if SpinCo is the requesting Party; (ii) such Information is necessary for Parent or any member of Parent Group to exercise its rights under the license granted in Section 3.1 of this Agreement, if Parent is the requesting Party, (iii) such Information is required by the requesting Party to comply with its obligations under this Agreement; or (iv) such Information is required by the requesting Party to comply with any obligation imposed by any Governmental Authority; provided, however, that, for any of the foregoing (i) - (iv), in the event that the Party to whom the request has been made determines that any such provision of Information could be detrimental to the Party providing the Information, violate any Law or agreement, or waive any privilege available under applicable Law, including any attorney-client privilege, then the Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to permit compliance with such obligations to the extent and in a manner that avoids any such harm or consequence. The Party providing Information pursuant to this Section 5.1(b) shall only be obligated to provide such Information in the form, condition and format in which it then exists, and in no event shall such Party be required to perform any improvement, modification, conversion, updating or reformatting of any such Information, and nothing in this Section 5.1 shall expand the obligations of a Party under Section 5.4.   5.2 Ownership of Information. The provision of any Information pursuant to Section 5.1 shall not affect the ownership of such Information (which shall be determined solely in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Separation Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements), or constitute a grant of rights in or to any such Information (such grant of rights, to the extent they exist, are expressly addressed elsewhere in this Agreement). For the avoidance of doubt, no Party shall be required to provide to the other Party any updates, improvements, or additions to any Intellectual Property that it owns after the Effective Time.   5.3 Compensation for Providing Information. The Party requesting Information pursuant to Section 5.1(b) above agrees to reimburse the other Party for the reasonable costs, if any, of creating, gathering, copying, transporting and otherwise complying with the request with respect to such Information (including any reasonable costs and expenses incurred in any review of Information for purposes of protecting the Privileged Information of the providing Party or in connection with the restoration of backup media for purposes of providing the requested Information). Except as may be otherwise specifically provided elsewhere in this Agreement, the Separation Agreement,

  -16-







  any other Ancillary Agreement or any other agreement between the Parties, such costs shall be computed in accordance with the providing Party's standard methodology and procedures.   5.4 Other Rights and Obligations.

To the extent (a) Parent, or any member of the Parent Group, receives from SpinCo, or any member of the SpinCo Group, or (b) SpinCo, or any member of the SpinCo Group receives from Parent, or any member of the Parent Group, any Information that is trade secret under applicable law, the five (5) year confidentiality period of Section 6.9(a) of the Separation Agreement with respect to such Information shall be extended until such time as the received Information is no longer trade secret.   6. FURTHER ASSURANCES AND ADDITIONAL COVENANTS   6.1 Further Assurances.   (a) In addition to the actions specifically provided for elsewhere in this Agreement, each of the Parties shall use its commercially reasonable efforts, prior to, on and after the Effective Time, to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws, regulations and agreements to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (b) Without limiting the foregoing, prior to, on and after the Effective Time, each Party hereto shall cooperate with the other Party, and without any further consideration, but at the expense of the requesting Party, to execute and deliver, or use its reasonable best efforts to cause to be executed and delivered, all instruments, including instruments of conveyance, assignment and transfer, and to make all filings with, and to obtain all Approvals or Notifications of, any Governmental Authority or any other Person under any permit, license, agreement, indenture or other instrument (including any consents or Governmental Approvals), and to take all such other actions as such Party may reasonably be requested to take by the other Party from time to time, consistent with the terms of this Agreement, in order to effectuate the provisions and purposes of this Agreement and the transfers of the SpinCo IP Assets and the assignment and assumption of the SpinCo IP Liabilities and the other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.   (c) On or prior to the Effective Time, Parent and SpinCo in their respective capacities as direct and indirect shareholders of the members of their Groups, shall each ratify any actions which are reasonably necessary or desirable to be taken by Parent, SpinCo or any of the members of their respective Groups, as the case may be, to effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   7. TERMINATION   7.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Effective Time by Parent, in its sole and absolute discretion, without the approval or consent of

  any other Person, including SpinCo. After the Effective Time, this Agreement may not be terminated except by an agreement in writing signed by a duly authorized officer of each of the Parties.   7.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of any termination of this Agreement prior to the Effective Time, no Party (nor any of its directors, officers, employees or agents) shall have any Liability or further obligation to the other Party by reason of this Agreement.   8. MISCELLANEOUS   8.1 Counterparts; Entire Agreement; Corporate Power.   (a) This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement, and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the other Party.   (b) This Agreement and the Separation Agreement and the Exhibits, Schedules and appendices hereto and thereto contain the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all previous agreements, negotiations, discussions, writings, understandings, commitments and conversations with respect to such subject matter, and there are no agreements or understandings between the Parties with respect to this Agreement.   (c) Parent represents on behalf of itself and each other member of the Parent Group, and SpinCo represents on behalf of itself and each other member of the SpinCo Group, as follows:   (i) each such Person has the requisite corporate or other power and authority and has taken all corporate or other action necessary in order to execute, deliver and perform this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby; and   (ii)  this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by it and constitutes a valid and binding agreement of it enforceable in accordance with the terms thereof.   (d)  Each Party acknowledges that it and each other Party may execute this Agreement by facsimile, stamp or mechanical signature, and that delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement (whether executed by manual, stamp or mechanical signature) by facsimile or by email in portable document format (PDF) shall be effective as delivery of such executed counterpart of this Agreement. Each Party expressly adopts and confirms each such facsimile, stamp or mechanical signature (regardless of whether delivered in person, by mail, by courier, by facsimile or by email in portable document format (PDF)) made in its respective name as if it were a manual signature delivered in person, agrees that it will not assert that any such signature or delivery is not adequate to bind such Party to the same extent as if it were signed manually and delivered in person and agrees that, at the reasonable request of the other Party at any time, it will as promptly as reasonably practicable cause this Agreement to be manually executed (any such execution to be as of the date of the initial date thereof) and delivered in person, by mail or by courier.
