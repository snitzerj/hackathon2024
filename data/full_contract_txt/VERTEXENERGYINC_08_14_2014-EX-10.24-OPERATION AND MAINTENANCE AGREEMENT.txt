In no event shall Owner's audits unreasonably interfere with Operator's operations.

ARTICLE VI    : FORCE MAJEURE

6.1    Procedure. If either Party is rendered unable, wholly or in part, by Force Majeure to carry out its obligations under this Agreement, other than the obligation to indemnify and to make payments then or thereafter due hereunder, upon such Party giving notice and full particulars of such Force Majeure in writing to the other Party as soon as reasonably possible after the occurrence of the cause relied on, then the obligations of the Party giving such notice, so far as they are affected by such Force Majeure, will be suspended during the continuance of any inability so caused but for no longer period, and such cause must as far as possible be remedied with all reasonable and diligent dispatch by the Party claiming such in order to put itself in a position to carry out its obligations

12 10.23





under this Agreement. Such notifying Party must also provide notice of the date of termination of such Force Majeure event. A Force Majeure event affecting the performance by either Party shall not relieve it of liability in the event of its negligence, where such negligence was a cause of the Force Majeure event, or in the event of its failure to use commercially reasonable efforts to remedy the situation and remove the cause with all reasonable dispatch.

6.2     Strikes. It is understood and agreed that the settlement of strikes or lockouts is entirely within the discretion of the Party directly involved in the strike or lockout, and that the above requirement that any Force Majeure must be remedied with all reasonable dispatch will not require the settlement of strikes or lockouts by acceding to the demands of the opposing party when such course is inadvisable in the discretion of the Party having the difficulty.

ARTICLE VII    : INSURANCE AND INDEMNIFICATION

7.1    Operator Insurance.

7.1.1     Operator, with respect to Operator's activities provided for under this Agreement, shall maintain the following insurance coverage with responsible insurance carriers:

(a)    Workers' Compensation. Operator shall maintain statutory worker's  compensation insurance, covering all of its and its Affiliates' employees and statutory employees, in accordance with the benefits afforded by the statutory Worker's Compensation Acts applicable to the state, territory, or district of hire, supervision, or place of accident. In addition, Operator shall maintain employer's liability insurance with a limit of not less than one million dollars ($1,000,000) each accident, one million dollars ($1,000,000) disease each employee, and one million dollars ($1,000,000) disease policy limit. Where not prohibited by law, Operator shall waive its right of subrogation against Owner.

(b)     Commercial General Liability Insurance. Operator shall maintain Commercial General Liability Insurance covering its operations under this Agreement including, without limitation, bodily injury, death, property damage, premises/operations, sudden and accidental pollution, independent contractors, products/completed operations, contractual, and personal injury liability, with a limit of not less than one million dollars ($1,000,000) per occurrence and two million dollars ($2,000,000) in the annual aggregate.

(c)     Commercial Automobile Insurance. Operator shall maintain Commercial Automobile Insurance coverage, including, without limitation, bodily injury and property damage for owned, hired, rented, and non-owned automotive equipment with a limit of not less than one million dollars ($1,000,000) per accident.

(d)     Umbrella Liability Insurance. Operator shall maintain Umbrella Liability Insurance coverage covering in excess of (a), (b), and (c) above, excluding Worker's Compensation, in the amount of ten million dollars ($10,000,000).

7.1.2     To the extent of the liabilities assumed by Operator in this Agreement, Operator shall name Owner Indemnified Parties as additional insured on all insurance policies,

13 10.23





except Workers' Compensation. The Owner Indemnified Parties' additional insured status will not limit the application of insurance protection as required by this Agreement which arises out of the Operator's indemnity obligations. These policies shall provide primary coverage for claims in which Operator has agreed to hold harmless and/or to indemnify the Owner Indemnified Parties. No "other insurance" clause may be invoked by any insurer. This coverage shall apply whether or not the indemnification is valid. Operator shall have its insurer(s) waive its right of subrogation against Owner Indemnified Parties on all insurance carried. Unless expressly stated to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement or prohibited by applicable law or legal statute, Operator's indemnification obligations under this Agreement shall not be limited by amount or in scope to coverage provided by insurance which is required under this Agreement.

7.1.3    Upon request, Operator agrees to furnish to Owner certificates of insurance or other evidence satisfactory to Owner to demonstrate that the required insurance has been procured and is in force. The certificate shall accurately reflect the required insurance coverages and shall provide that in the event of modification, expiration, cancellation or material change in a policy affecting the certificate holder, thirty days prior written notice shall be given to the certificate holder. Operator waives all rights against Owner for recovery of damages to the extent such damages are covered by the insurance maintained in accordance with this Section 7.1.

7.2    Contractors. Operator acknowledges and agrees that any contractor engaged by Operator to perform services at the Rail Facility will be required to execute an access agreement, in a  form acceptable to Owner, prior to such contractor accessing the Rail Facility and performing any services. Further, Operator shall attempt to obtain reasonable indemnification and insurance protection from contractors performing services for Owner to protect Owner and Operator. Operator shall require each of its contractors to carry insurance coverage substantially equivalent to the insurance required of Operator above, and to include provisions for its contractors to name Owner and Operator as additional insureds, with the exception of Workers' Compensation Insurance, and state that such policies will be primary to and non-contributory with any other insurance maintained by Operator and Owner. With respect to Workers' Compensation Insurance, the applicable contractor shall be required to cause its insurers to wave all rights of recovery or subrogation against Owner and Operator, where not prohibited by law.

7.3    Notice of Claims. In the event that Operator receives notice, either in writing or orally, of an asserted or threatened Liability Claim against Operator or Owner, Operator shall provide Owner within 10 days of receipt of such Liability Claim a copy of any demand letter, petition, or similar documentation of the Liability Claim.

7.4    Mutual Release and Indemnification.

7.4.1    Owner's Indemnification. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, including, without limitation, Section 8.8 of this Agreement, Owner shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Operator Indemnified Parties from and against all Claims and Losses arising out of or relating to (i) allegations of death or bodily injury or damage to property, to the extent arising out of or resulting from the negligence, gross negligence or willful misconduct of Owner, its Affiliates or its or their respective officers, directors, employees, or contractors in connection with this Agreement or the performance hereof; provided that Owner shall not be required to indemnify the Operator

14 10.23





Indemnified Parties against such Claims and Losses to the extent such Claims and Losses are attributable to the acts or omissions of any Operator Indemnified Parties, (ii) any breach of this Agreement by Owner, and (iii) any agreements relating to the Rail Facility between Owner and third parties not affiliated with the Operator Parties (except to the extent expressly assumed by Operator hereunder). The duty to indemnify, defend and hold harmless under this Section 7.4.1 shall continue in full force and effect, notwithstanding the expiration or early termination of this Agreement, with respect to any Claims or Losses based on facts or conditions that occurred prior to such expiration or termination.

7.4.2     Operator's Indemnification. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, including, without limitation, Section 8.8 of this Agreement, Operator shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Owner Indemnified Parties from and against all Claims and Losses arising out of or relating to (i) allegations of death or bodily injury or damage to property, to the extent arising out of or resulting from the negligence, gross negligence or willful misconduct of Operator, its Affiliates or its or their respective officers, directors, employees, or contractors in connection with this Agreement or the performance hereof; provided that Operator shall not be required to indemnify the Owner Indemnified Parties against such Claims or Losses to the extent such Claims or Losses are attributable to the acts or omissions of any Owner Indemnified Party, (ii) any breach of this Agreement by Operator, and (iii) any agreements relating to the Rail Facility between Operator and third parties not affiliated with Owner (except to the extent expressly assumed by Owner hereunder). The duty to indemnify, defend and hold harmless under this Section 7.4.2 shall continue in full force and effect, notwithstanding the expiration or early termination of this Agreement, with respect to any Claims or Losses based on facts or conditions that occurred prior to such expiration or termination.
