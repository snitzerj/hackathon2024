  equal to the applicable Dedicated Rates, which shall initially be the rate(s) set forth in Schedule A attached hereto, and which shall be increased by Carrier annually, effective July 1 of each year following the Commencement Date, as provided in the Tariff ("Shipper's Dedicated Rates").

6.2 Regulation Changes. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event that, after the Effective Date, any Governmental Authority promulgates, issues or changes any rules, regulations or other mandates that impose any material fee, charge or cost upon Carrier in connection with the performance of the Services performed hereunder, excluding normal fees, charges or costs that are incurred by Carrier irrespective of whether Carrier provides the Services on behalf of Shipper and excluding Taxes addressed in Article XVII, then Carrier may increase the then-effective Shipper's Dedicated Rates by up to ten percent (10%) to account for such fees, charges or costs (to the extent such fees, charges or costs are attributable to Shipper Product); provided, however, the cumulative effect of all such increases pursuant to this Section 6.2 may not exceed thirty percent (30%) of the initial Shipper's Dedicated Rates (as the same may be adjusted pursuant to the Tariff from time to time). If, in Carrier's reasonable judgment, an increase in Shipper's Dedicated Rates of more than ten percent (10%) would be required to place Carrier in substantially the same economic position as it was in prior to the imposition or assessment of such fees, charges or costs, Carrier may call for a meeting among the Parties' senior management to take place within thirty (30) Days of written notice to Shipper, and the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to amend the provisions of this Agreement such that the Parties are in substantially the same relative economic position as they were in prior to the imposition or assessment of such fees, charges or costs. If the Parties are unable to agree on an economic adjustment within sixty (60) Days of the senior management meeting, then Carrier may, in its sole discretion, terminate this Agreement without penalty by delivering Shipper written notice of Carrier's intent to terminate. Such termination shall be effective, at the option of Shipper, (i) as of 9:00 a.m. on the first Day of the Month which follows the Month that Carrier delivered its notice of intent to terminate, or (ii) as of 9:00 a.m. on the first Day of the Month which is twelve (12) Months after such date, provided that Shipper's Dedicated Rates for such twelve (12) Month period before such termination shall be increased to place Carrier in substantially the same economic position as it was in prior to the imposition or assessment of such fees, charges, or costs. Shipper shall exercise such option by delivery of written notice to Carrier of Shipper's election within ten (10) Business Days of receipt of Carrier's notice to terminate, provided that if Shipper has not responded to Carrier by the time described in clause (i) above, the Agreement shall continue pursuant to clause (ii) above.

Shipper shall be entitled to audit Carrier's applicable books and records for the limited purpose of determining if the amount of any increase pursuant to this Section 6.2 is justified by the actually-incurred and reasonable amount of the aggregate costs and/or expenses relating to the System; provided, however, such audit shall not require Carrier to disclose confidential information of any Person other than Shipper who is a shipper on the System. If such audit shall reflect that such increase was not justifiable in accordance with the foregoing, Carrier shall promptly credit the amount of such discrepancy to Shipper, unless Carrier disagrees with the results of such audit, in which case the matter shall be resolved pursuant to the dispute resolution provisions set forth in Article XII hereof.

6.3 Governmental Modifications. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Parties acknowledge that the Tariff rates payable for all Services are subject to the approval of and modification by the FERC or any other Governmental Authority having jurisdiction.   7

ARTICLE XIII FINANCIAL ASSURANCES

13.1 Financial Assurances. If Shipper has failed to pay any amount when due under this Agreement and if such non-payment is not being disputed in good faith by Shipper, Carrier shall have the right to request and receive from Shipper adequate assurance of performance ("Financial Assurance") which shall mean credit support in a form reasonably acceptable to Carrier and in an amount and for the term reasonably acceptable to Carrier. Any of the following shall be an acceptable form of credit support:

  (a) An irrevocable standby letter of credit from a bank satisfactory to Carrier;   14

Source: RANGE RESOURCES - LOUISIANA, INC., 8-K, 4/17/2015





  (b) Provide a prepayment or a deposit in advance of the Month in which Services hereunder are to be provided; or

  (c) A performance bond issued by a Person satisfactory to Carrier.

If the credit of Shipper's guarantor is satisfactory in Carrier's opinion, a demand for Financial Assurance can be satisfied with a guarantee issued on behalf of Shipper in a form acceptable to Carrier, but only for as long as the credit of Shipper's guarantor continues to be acceptable to Carrier. Carrier acknowledges and agrees that Memorial Resource Development Corp. is a satisfactory guarantor.

Should Shipper or its guarantor fail to provide Financial Assurance within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of written demand for such assurance, then Carrier shall have the right to suspend performance under this Agreement until such time as Shipper furnishes Financial Assurance. For the avoidance of doubt, such suspension of performance by Carrier shall not relieve Shipper of its obligation to make payments of amounts due hereunder, including, without limitation, payment of fees due hereunder.

If during the Term, Carrier has failed to pay any amount when due under this Agreement and if such non-payment is not being disputed in good faith by Carrier, Shipper shall have the right to request and receive from Carrier adequate Financial Assurance under similar terms and conditions as described above, including the right to suspend performance under this Agreement until such time as Carrier furnishes Financial Assurance.

ARTICLE XIV DUTY TO SUPPORT

14.1 Arm's Length Negotiations. Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that this Agreement is the result of good faith, arm's length negotiations which have resulted in an agreement that is fair and equitable to Carrier and Shipper.

14.2 Shipper Support. Shipper hereby agrees, upon written request by Carrier provided at least ten (10) days prior to the deadline for such action: (a) to not object to Carrier's applications for necessary certificates, approvals, authorizations and permits of the FERC and Louisiana regulating bodies, if any, in relation to the System; (b) to not object to the Tariff rates calculated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and not take any action directly or indirectly that could be interpreted as evidence of Shipper's lack of support for such Tariff rates; and (c) to not object to the pro forma Tariff materially in the form attached as Exhibit A, in any and all regulatory proceedings relating thereto and not take any action or inaction that could be interpreted as evidence of Shipper's lack of support therefor; provided that nothing in the foregoing shall obligate Shipper to support future changes to the Tariff rates that are inconsistent with this Agreement, or prevent Shipper from opposing any position taken by Carrier before FERC and/or Louisiana regulating bodies that is inconsistent with this Agreement.   15

14.3 No Tariff Rate Revision Proceedings.

14.4 Third Party Proceedings. In the event of any Tariff Rate Revision Proceeding being commenced by a third party or by the FERC itself, and in the event of any other proceedings pursuant to which the Tariff rates for the System may be reviewed by the FERC or other Governmental Authority having jurisdiction, Shipper agrees to not object to the setting of Tariff rates applicable to the System that are consistent with this Agreement. In the event of any other proceedings challenging any of the terms of this Agreement being commenced by a third party or by the FERC itself, Shipper agrees to provide all reasonable support and cooperation in defending such terms or otherwise resolving the complaint or other challenge as shall be reasonably requested by Carrier.

G. Carrier is not responsible for monitoring receipts or deliveries for contaminants. Further, Carrier reserves the right to dispose of any contaminated Product on the System. Disposal thereof may be made in any reasonable manner including but not limited to commercial sales. Any liability associated with the contamination or disposal of any Products shall be borne by Shipper introducing the contaminated Products into the System. Shipper liability includes, but is not limited to, claims from other Shippers, carriers, or users of the contaminated Products and the costs of any regulatory or judicial proceeding.



H. If Product received by Carrier does not meet the quality specifications set forth in this Item No. 3, Carrier reserves the right to charge the Shipper the greater of (i) the actual costs and expenses incurred by Carrier to treat, handle, or otherwise dispose of all such contaminated Product, or (ii) a one-hundred (100) cents per Barrel charge for the volume of contaminated Product transported by Shipper ("Off-Spec Penalty"). If a composite sample, spot sample, or the results of any other test demonstrates that a Shipper's Product delivered to Carrier fails to meet the quality specifications set forth in this Item No. 3, the total penalty will be assessed by multiplying the Off-Spec Penalty by the total volume of Shipper's Product (in barrels) received by Carrier during the ticket period when Carrier received the contaminated Product.

  4. IDENTITY OF PRODUCTS:

Subject to any provisions to the contrary in a TSA between Carrier and Shipper:

  A. Carrier shall not be liable to Shipper for changes in gravity or quality of Shipper's Products that may occur from commingling or intermixing Shipper's Products with other Products in the same Common Stream while in transit. Carrier is not obligated to deliver to Shipper the identical Product nominated by Shipper; Carrier will deliver the Product it is regularly transporting as a Common Stream.

  B. Carrier shall have no responsibility in, or for, any revaluation or settlements that may be deemed appropriate by Shippers and/or Consignees because of mixing or commingling of Products between the receipt and delivery of such shipments by Carrier within the same Common Stream.

  C. Carrier shall not be required to transport Product except with reasonable diligence, considering the quality of the Product, the distanceof transportation and other material elements. Carrier cannot commit to delivering Product to a particular destination, at a particular time.

  5. NOMINATIONS AND SCHEDULING:



A. Product for shipment through the System will be received only on a properly executed Nomination from Shipper or its designee showing the Receipt Point at which the Product is to be received, the Delivery Point of the shipment, Consignee (if any), and the amount of Product to be transported. Carrier may refuse to accept Product for transportation unless satisfactory evidence is furnished that Shipper or Consignee has made provision for prompt receipt thereof at the Delivery Point. Carrier shall not be obligated to accept Product for transportation during any calendar month, unless Shipper or its designee makes such Nomination to Carrier in writing on or before 9:00 a.m., prevailing Central Time of the tenth (10t h) Business Day immediately preceding the first day of the month during which the transportation under the Nomination is to begin.   7

  B. Carrier may refuse to accept Product for transportation where Shipper or Consignee is not in compliance with other provisions of this Tariff or where Shipper or Consignee has failed to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations made by any governmental authorities regulating shipments of Products.

  C. Unless Shipper and Carrier have agreed otherwise in a TSA, Carrier reserves the right to control in its discretion the component distribution in the Product tendered by Shipper or its designee, in order to achieve maximum operating efficiency of Carrier's facilities and optimum utilization of total transportation capacity. Carrier shall use reasonable judgment in exercising that discretion.



D. The rate at which Product is delivered to Carrier and redelivered from Carrier will be determined by Carrier's transportation and redelivery obligations to its shippers and by the necessity of economical use and efficient operation of Carrier's facilities, which shall be determined by Carrier in the exercise of its reasonable judgment. Carrier will assume no liability for its inability to maintain schedules or comply with Shipper's redelivery requests when caused by operational or scheduling problems, excess demand, delays and other problems encountered in pipeline operations.

  6. NOMINATIONS IN EXCESS OF CAPACITY:

When there is offered to Carrier quantities of Product greater than can be transported on the System, Carrier shall allocate the available transportation capacity on the System ("Available Capacity"). Allocation will be given as a daily or monthly volume, at Carrier's discretion, and will be calculated for the calendar month.

New Shippers will have access to a minimum of ten percent (10%) of the Available Capacity and Historical Shippers will have access to a maximum of ninety percent (90%) of the Available Capacity.

Carrier shall allocate up to ninety percent (90%) of the Available Capacity on a non-discriminatory historical basis to all Historical Shippers. Each individual Historical Shipper's entitlement will be based on (i) the average monthly volumes of the Historical Shipper's Representative Period, based on the greater of the volumes transported or paid for during each month of the Representative Period or (ii) for an Incentive Shipper, based on the Incentive Shipper's Committed Volume on a yearly basis.

The remaining ten percent (10%) of the Available Capacity shall be allocated on a prorata basis to New Shippers. Carrier is not required to allocate more than two percent (2%) of the Available Capacity to any individual New Shipper.

The Carrier will repeat this allocation process until all of the Available Capacity has been allocated.

Allocation will not be transferred. With agreement of the Shippers concerned, historical volume will be transferred under the following conditions:

  •   No commercial transaction occurs between the participating shippers with regard to historical volumes.

  •   The transfer is irrevocable.

  •   The request to transfer must be the result of an unusual situation as may be reasonably determined by Carrier.   8

C. Carrier may require Shipper to furnish a certificate setting forth in detail the specification of each shipment of Product offered for transportation hereunder, and Shipper shall be liable for any contamination or damage to other Product in Carrier's custody or to the System or other Carrier facilities caused by failure of the Product Tendered to meet the specifications stated in Shipper's certification. Carrier may, but shall not be required to, sample and/or test any shipment prior to acceptance or during receipt of shipment, and, in the event of variance between the specifications contained in said certificate and the specifications indicated by Carrier's test, Carrier's test result shall prevail and be used to determine whether the shipment meets Carrier's specifications. Shipper or Consignee may be present or represented at such measuring and testing.

At any time, upon the request of Carrier, Shipper shall, within ten (10) days of such request, provide information to Carrier that will allow Carrier to determine Shipper's capacity to perform any financial obligations that could arise from the transportation of that Shipper's Product under the terms of this Tariff, including the payment of transportation charges, equalization obligations, the value of any loss allowance, and any negative Shipper balance positions. Carrier shall not be obligated to accept Product for transportation from any Shipper or prospective shipper if such Shipper or prospective shipper fails to provide the requested information to Carrier within the time periods set forth herein, or if Carrier's review of the requested information reveals that such Shipper or prospective shipper does not have the capacity to perform any financial obligations that could arise from the transportation of its Product under the terms of this Tariff, including the payment of transportation charges, equalization obligations, the reasonably determined value of any loss allowance, and any negative balance positions.

  F. Subject to the provisions of Item No. 16(G), Carrier upon notice to Shipper or prospective shipper, may require one or more of the following financial assurances for the payment of all charges and costs as provided for in this Tariff, or otherwise lawfully due to Carrier to be provided at the expense of such Shipper or prospective shipper:



i. payment security by wire transfer in an amount equal to two and a half months of transportation charges based on Shipper's or prospective shipper's likely actual shipments for the production month for each applicable line segment.

Such lien shall survive delivery of Products to Shipper. Such lien shall extend to all Products in Carrier's possession beginning with Shipper's first receipt of transportation or other services from Carrier. The lien provided herein shall be in addition to any lien or security interest provided by this Tariff, statute or applicable law. Carrier may withhold delivery to Shipper of any of Shipper's Products in its possession and exercise any other rights and remedies granted under the applicable tariffs or existing under applicable law until all such charges have been paid as provided above.



J. If Shipper fails to pay an invoice by the due date, Carrier will notify Shipper of the failure, and if Shipper has not remedied the failure within thirty (30) days following receipt of notice from Carrier, in addition to any other remedies under this Tariff or under applicable law, Carrier shall have the right, either directly or through an agent, to sell any Products of such Shipper in Carrier's custody at public auction, on any day not a legal holiday, not less than forty-eight (48) hours after publication of notice of such sale in a daily newspaper of general circulation published in the town, city, or general area where the sale is to be held, stating the time and place of sale and the quantity and location of the Products to be sold.
