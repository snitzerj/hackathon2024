The following amendments apply in lieu of any contract provisions to the contrary.

The following provisions are included as part of this contract:

MAINTENANCE OF SOLVENCY. This provision applies only to benefits provided through the General Account. If the solvency of the Society becomes impaired, you may be required to make an extra payment. The Board of Directors will determine the amount of any extra payment. It will be based on each member's fair share of the deficiency. You may make the extra payment by an equivalent reduction in benefits or by a payment in cash. If you do not make the extra payment within 60 days from the date we notify you of your share of the deficiency, the amount will be charged as an indebtedness against the contract with interest compounded at the rate of 5% per year.

MEMBERSHIP. The person(s) named as the Insured(s) or the Annuitant(s) is a benefit member of the Society. Rights and privileges of membership are set forth in the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Society. These rights and privileges are separate from the ownership of this contract.

DIVIDENDS. Each year, we will determine our divisible surplus. This contract's share, if any, will be credited as a dividend. Since we do not expect this contract to contribute to divisible surplus, it is not expected that any dividends will be credited.

DIVIDEND OPTIONS. If dividends are credited after premiums can no longer be paid under this contract, dividends will be paid in cash. Otherwise, dividends will be applied under the Payment of Premium option unless the Cash option has been chosen in writing.

Cash. Dividends are paid in cash.

Payment of Premium. Dividends are applied as payment of a Net Premium. VB-TL-TFFL (18) page TL-1 @TL18#AA
