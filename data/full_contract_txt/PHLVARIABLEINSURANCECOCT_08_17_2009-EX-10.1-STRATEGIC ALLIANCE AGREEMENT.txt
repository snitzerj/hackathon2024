4.11 Ownership of GIE; No Claims Relating to GIE. Except as set forth in Section 10.01, PHLVIC and its Affiliates, as applicable, are  the exclusive legal and beneficial owner of and have good and marketable title in and to the GIE and all intellectual property  rights therein, free and clear of all pledges, claims, liens, charges, encumbrances and security interests of any kind or character,  including any claims for infringement of intellectual property rights. For the purposes of this Section, intellectual property  includes GIE forms, specimen forms, the features of the GIE, materials filed by any of the PHL Parties with State insurance  regulators, and any other forms prepared by any of the PHL Parties or any of their Affiliates in connection with the GIE.

5.04 Non-Contravention. PLIC has duly executed and delivered this Agreement and neither such execution and delivery nor the  performance by PLIC of any of its obligations under the Transaction Documents to which it is a party will (i) violate any  provision of its articles of incorporation or by-laws (ii) result in a violation or breach of, or constitute a default or an event of  default under, any indenture, mortgage, bond or other contract, license, agreement, permit, instrument or other commitment or  obligation to which it is a party or by which it is bound or (iii) materially violate any Law applicable to it or its business.

  5.05 Licenses and Permits. As of the Effective Date, PLIC has, and during the term of this Agreement shall use reasonable efforts to  maintain all material licenses, permits, registrations, authorizations, orders, consents, and other approvals by each Government  Entity necessary or advisable for the performance of its obligations under the Transaction Documents to which it is a party.

  5.06 Compliance with Law.

The  Prospectus or other information contained in the Registration Statement, when disseminated or used after the effective date of  the Registration Statement, shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to  make the statements therein not misleading in light of the circumstances under which they were made (it being understood that  no representation is made with respect to information about ICAS or ICC provided by ICAS or ICC in writing to PHL Variable).  PLIC shall immediately notify ICC in the event PLIC believes or has reason to believe that the representations and warranties in  this paragraph are no longer true or completely accurate.



5.10 Tax Matters. It is more likely than not that: (1) PLIC will not be treated as the owner of the assets in an ICC Account for federal  income tax purposes; (2) the GIE, including each Certificate, will be treated as an annuity contract for federal income tax  purposes; (3) for all Certificate Holders on the date of GIE issuance and during the entire period during which the GIE and each  Certificate is in effect, losses with respect to the ICC Account will be deductible under Section 165(a) of the IRC  notwithstanding the existence of the GIE' conditional guarantee of annual lifetime income payments in the event that the value  of the assets in an ICC Account decreases to zero; (4) for all Certificate Owners on the date of GIE issuance and during the  entire period during which the GIE and each Certificate is in effect, dividends on stock held in an ICC Account otherwise  meeting the requirements of Section 1(h)(11) of the IRC will constitute qualified dividend income notwithstanding the existence  of a GIE and its conditional guarantee of annual lifetime income payments in the event the value of the assets in the ICC  Account decreases to zero; and (5) for each Certificate Owners on the date of Certificate issuance and during the entire period  during which the GIE and each Certificate is in effect, the Certificate and assets in the ICC Account subject thereto will not be  treated as a straddle under Section 1092 of the IRC.

   - 25 -



12.02.2 Limitation. Indemnification pursuant to this Section 12.02 shall be in addition to any liability that the ICC may  otherwise have.

The  failure of the Indemnifying Party to give such notice and to undertake the defense of or to settle or compromise  such a claim shall constitute a waiver of the Indemnifying Party's rights under this Section 12.04.1 and shall  preclude the Indemnifying Party from disputing the manner in which the Indemnified Party may conduct the defense  of such claim or the reasonableness of any amount paid by the Indemnified Party in satisfaction of such claim.
