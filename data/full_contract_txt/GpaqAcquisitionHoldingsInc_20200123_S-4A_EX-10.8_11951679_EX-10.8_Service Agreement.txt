(d) Right to Contest Claims of Third Persons. If an Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification hereunder because of a claim asserted by any claimant (other than a Constellation Indemnified Person or HOF Entity Indemnified Person) (a "Third Person"), the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt notice thereof after such assertion is actually known to the Indemnified Party; provided, however, that the right of a person or entity to be indemnified hereunder in respect of claims made by a Third Person shall not be adversely affected by a failure to give such notice unless, and then only to the extent that, an Indemnifying Party is actually irrevocably and materially prejudiced thereby. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, upon written notice to the Indemnified Party, and using counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, to investigate, contest or settle the claim alleged by such Third Person (a "Third Person Claim"), provided that the Indemnifying Party has unconditionally acknowledged to the Indemnified Party in writing its obligation to indemnify the persons and entities to be indemnified hereunder with respect to such Third Person Claim and to discharge (and does in fact so discharge) any cost or expense arising out of such investigation, contest or settlement.

Unless and until the Indemnifying Party so acknowledges its obligation to indemnify, the Indemnified Party shall have the right, at its option, to assume and control defense of the matter and to look to the Indemnifying Party for the full amount of the reasonable costs of defense. The failure of the Indemnifying Party to respond in writing to the aforesaid notice of the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Person Claim within thirty (30) days after receipt thereof shall be deemed an irrevocable election not to defend the same. If the Indemnifying Party does not so acknowledge its obligation to indemnify and assume the defense of any such Third Person Claim, (i) the Indemnified Party may defend against such claim using counsel of its choice, in such manner as it may reasonably deem appropriate, including, but not limited to, settling such claim, after giving notice of the same to the Indemnifying Party, on such terms as the Indemnified Party may reasonably deem appropriate, and (ii) the Indemnifying Party may participate in (but not control) the defense of such action, with its own counsel at its own expense. If the Indemnifying Party thereafter seeks to question the manner in which the Indemnified Party defended such Third Person Claim or the amount or nature of any such settlement, the Indemnifying Party shall have the burden to prove by clear and convincing evidence that conduct of the Indemnified Party in the defense and/or settlement of such Third Person Claim constituted gross negligence or willful misconduct.

6.4 Modifications. No amendment or modification of any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be effective unless such modification is expressed in writing and executed by each of the Parties. 6.5 Governing Law; Venue. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Ohio, without reference to principles of conflicts of law. Any suit or action filed or otherwise commenced in connection with this Agreement must be filed and litigated in an appropriate court located in the City of Canton, Ohio (provided, however, that if the suit or action involves a claim for which federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction, then such suit or action must be filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of the State of Ohio in Akron, Ohio), or such other venue as deemed appropriate by the HOF Entities. In the event of a dispute between an HOF Entity and Constellation regarding their rights and duties hereunder, the non-prevailing Party in any ensuing litigation shall pay the reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses of the prevailing Party (including costs of discovery and expert witness fees). 6.6 Subordination. This Agreement shall in all respects be subordinate to any and all agreements executed prior to the date of this Agreement between the HOF Entities and Johnson Controls, Inc. or any of its affiliates. In the event of any conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of any such agreement, this Agreement shall be deemed superseded by such conflicting provision of such other agreement. 6.7 Force Majeure. (a) Fire or Other Damage to Village. If the Village is damaged by fire, earthquake, act of God, the elements or other casualty or is condemned by an authority exercising the powers of eminent domain or the Village is transferred in lieu of the exercise of such power so as to render the Village unusable for its intended purpose at any time during the Term, then the HOF Entities shall have the option, but not the obligation, to repair the damage or loss. The HOF Entities shall notify Constellation as to whether the HOF Entities shall effect such repair and restoration within thirty (30) days after the casualty. If the HOF Entities notify Constellation that the HOF Entities are electing to effect such repairs and restoration, this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect; provided, however, that the Term shall be extended by such number of days as equals the length of the period from the date of the event until such repairs and restoration are complete. If the HOF Entities notify Constellation that the HOF Entities are electing not to effect such repairs and restoration, then this Agreement and all rights granted hereunder shall terminate as of the date of such fire or other casualty. (b) Other. Except as otherwise set forth herein, neither Party shall be liable or responsible for any failure to perform its obligations hereunder, which failure is caused or brought about in any manner beyond the control of such Party, including, but not limited to, the breakdown or failure of apparatus, equipment, or machinery employed in its supply of said services, any temporary stoppage for the repair, improvement or enlargement thereof, or any other act or condition beyond its reasonable control, other than such Party's inability to perform payment obligations.

(c) Tolling. In the event that, after the construction and development of the Village has been substantially completed, the Village is not usable for a period of at least thirty (30) days as a result of the events described under this Section 6.7 and unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms, the Term shall be extended for that period of time (after substantial completion) which the Village was not usable and the start and end dates of each period shall be adjusted to reflect the number of days (after substantial completion) in which the Village was not usable for all purposes of this Agreement, including without limitation the expiration date of the Term. 6.8 Not a Lease or License of the Village. This Agreement will not constitute a lease or license of any part of the Village. It will represent solely a contractual obligation of the HOF Entities to provide to Constellation certain other benefits hereunder. 6.9 Insurance. Constellation shall, at its own expense, secure and maintain in full force and effect throughout the Term (a) insurance coverage for defamation, trademark and service mark infringement, unfair competition, copyright infringement, and infringement of a person's right of publicity and right of privacy from a carrier with an A.M. Best rating of A10 or better in an amount not less than [***] per occurrence; and (b) a general liability insurance policy from a carrier with an A.M. Best rating of A10 or better in an amount not less than [***] in aggregate. The liability limits may be met with any combination of primary and excess or umbrella insurance policy limits. Constellation shall provide the HOF Entities with certificates of insurance, naming each HOF Entity as an additional insured, evidencing the existence of such insurance policies within ten (10) days after execution of this Agreement. 6.10 Confidentiality. Without limiting the generality of the obligations set forth in the Mutual Confidentiality Agreement between Constellation and HOFV dated as of April 28, 2018 (which shall survive in accordance with its terms), the Parties hereto agree to maintain in confidence the terms and conditions of this Agreement (except with respect to their owners, lenders and advisors, each of whom is to be made aware of and instructed to comply with this confidentiality provision) unless the proposed disclosure of specific terms or conditions hereof is authorized in advance by the other Party or is otherwise required by law. In the event that either Party or any of its representatives becomes legally compelled to disclose any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement, such Party shall, to the extent reasonably practicable, provide the other Party with prompt written notice before such disclosure, sufficient to enable such other Party either to seek a protective order, at its expense, or another appropriate remedy preventing or prohibiting such disclosure or to waive compliance with the provisions of this Section, or both. 6.11 Press Releases. The HOF Entities and Constellation shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or scheduling any press conference or conference call with media members or other third parties with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. The HOF Entities and Constellation shall mutually agree on the content of any such press release prior to its publication. 6.12 No Defamation or Disparagement. No Party will make, issue or release any statement which results in any defamation or disparagement of the Village, the City of Canton, the other Party, or any team, person, performer or organization involved in events at the Village.

6.13 Independent Contractor. The Parties shall be and act as independent contractors, and under no circumstances shall this Agreement be construed as one of agency, partnership, joint venture or employment among the Parties. 6.14 Headings. The headings used in this Agreement are solely for convenience and shall not affect the meaning or interpretation of the provisions set forth herein. 6.15 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts, and on separate counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument. 6.16 Waiver. No action, other than a notice by a Party to another Party specifically stating that such notice has the effect of waiver, shall constitute a waiver of any particular breach or default of such other Party. No such waiver notice from a Party shall waive any other Party's failure to fully comply with any other term, condition, or provision of this Agreement, irrespective of any knowledge any HOF Entity or Constellation officer, manager, employee, or agent may have of any breach or default of, or noncompliance with, such other term, condition, or provision. No waiver of full performance by a Party shall be construed, or operate, as a waiver of any subsequent default of any of the terms, covenants and conditions of this Agreement. The payment or acceptance of fees or charges for any period after a default shall not be deemed a waiver of any right or acceptance of defective performance. 6.17 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement shall be determined to be contrary to law and unenforceable by any court of law, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby are not affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible. 6.18 Third Party Beneficiaries. Except for the HOF Entity Indemnified Persons and Constellation Indemnified Persons, (i) this Agreement is intended only for the benefit of the Parties hereto, the affiliates of the HOF Entities and any successors, permitted assigns or substitutes as expressly provided for in this Agreement, (ii) no other person or entity is intended to be benefited in any way by this Agreement and (iii) this Agreement shall not be enforceable by any other person or entity. 6.19 Cost and Expenses. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, each Party shall bear its own costs and expenses in connection with the preparation, negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. 6.20 HOF Entity Rights and Obligations. The Parties acknowledge and agree that rights vested in the HOF Entities collectively under this Agreement shall be deemed vested in each HOF Entity and its affiliates and that obligations of the HOF Entities collectively under this Agreement may be satisfied by either HOF Entity or any of their affiliates. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, while certain rights set forth in this Agreement may be contemplated to be provided by HOFV and other rights set forth in this Agreement may be contemplated to be provided by PFHOF (or by both HOF Entities), each of such rights may be provided by HOFV, PFHOF and/or any of their respective affiliates.
