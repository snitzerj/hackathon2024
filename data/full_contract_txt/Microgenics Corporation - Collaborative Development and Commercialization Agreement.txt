Claims, to the extent arising out of or relating to: (a) the breach by Microgenics of any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement; (b) the willful misconduct or negligent acts of Microgenics, its Affiliates or any of their respective employees, officers, directors, or agents; (c) the manufacture, promotion, distribution, use, testing, marketing or sale of the Assay; or (d) claims of infringement of Third Party Patents based upon the manufacture, use or sale of the Assay; except, in each case, to the extent such Losses result from clauses (a), (b) (c) or (d) of Section 11.1 (Indemnification by Achaogen).   11.3 Conditions to Indemnification The obligations of the indemnified Party under Sections 11.1 (Indemnification by Achaogen) and 11.2 (Indemnification by Microgenics) are conditioned upon the delivery of written notice to the indemnifying Party of any potential liability promptly after the indemnified Party become aware of such potential liability; provided, however, that the failure to give such notice promptly shall not impair a Party's right to indemnification under this Section 11.3 (Conditions to Indemnification) unless the delay in providing such notice has a material adverse effect on the ability of the indemnifying Party to defend against such liability. The indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume the defense of any suit or claim relating to the liability if it has assumed responsibility for the suit or claim in writing; however, if in the reasonable judgment of the indemnified Party, such suit or claim involves an issue or matter which could have a material adverse effect on the business operation or assets of the indemnified Party, the indemnified Party may waive its rights to indemnity under this Agreement and control the defense or settlement thereof, but in no event shall any such waiver be construed as a waiver of any rights such indemnified Party may have against any Third Party at law or in equity.

Neither of the Parties may settle a claim or action related to a Third Party Claim without the consent of the other Party, if such settlement would impose any monetary obligation on the other Party, or would require the other Party to submit to an injunction or otherwise limit the other Party's rights under this Agreement. Any payments made by a Party to settle any such claim or action shall be at its own costs and expense, except in the event such payment was made with the prior written consent of an indemnifying Party, in which case such payment shall be subject to the obligations of the Parties as set forth in Sections 11.1 (Indemnification by Achaogen), 11.2 (Indemnification by Microgenics), and 11.3 (Conditions to Indemnification).   11.5 Limitation of Liability. EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO DAMAGES THAT ARISE DUE TO A  PARTY'S BREACH OF CONFIDENTIALITY (ARTICLE 12) OR  INDEMNIFICATION  OBLIGATIONS  (ARTICLE 11),  IN  NO  EVENT WILL  EITHER  PARTY  BE  LIABLE  TO  THE  OTHER  FOR  CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT,  SPECIAL,  EXEMPLARY OR  PUNITIVE DAMAGES  FOR ANY  CAUSE OF  ACTION, WHETHER  IN  CONTRACT, TORT  OR OTHERWISE,  INCLUDING LOST REVENUES, PROFITS OR BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES ARISING OUT OF OR  IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER OR NOT THE OTHER  PARTY WAS  OR  SHOULD HAVE  BEEN  AWARE OF  THE POSSIBILITY OF  THESE DAMAGES.

During the Term, and for a period of [***] ([***]) years thereafter, all Confidential Information disclosed to a Party hereto or its Affiliates (the "Receiving Party") by the other Party or its Affiliates (the "Disclosing Party") shall be deemed confidential and shall be treated as such by the Receiving Party (meaning that the Receiving Party shall take the same steps to protect such information as it does to protect its own confidential information, which in any event shall be no less than the reasonable protective measures for the industry) and shall only be used for the purposes of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential Information shall not include information that is:     (a) known by the Receiving Party at the time of its receipt and not through a prior disclosure by the Disclosing Party;     (b) at the time of disclosure or thereafter, becomes published or otherwise part of the public domain through no breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party;     (c) subsequently disclosed to the Receiving Party by a Third Party having the right to make such a disclosure; or     (d) developed by the Receiving Party, as evidenced by its records, independently of information received by it from the Disclosing Party hereunder.   12.2 Permitted Disclosure.  Information provided under this Agreement may be disclosed to employees, agents or consultants of the Receiving Party, but only to the extent required to accomplish the purposes of this Agreement and only after the Receiving Party obtains the prior agreement of its employees, agents and consultants to whom disclosure is to be made to hold in confidence and not to make use of such information for any purpose other than that permitted by this Agreement. In addition to the foregoing exceptions, either Party may disclose Confidential Information to the extent it is required to be disclosed under Applicable Law, or in connection with any application by the Receiving Party for any Regulatory Approvals; provided, however, that the Receiving Party shall furnish the Disclosing Party with as much prior written notice of such disclosure requirement as reasonably practicable, so as to permit the Disclosing Party, in its sole discretion, and at its sole expense, to take appropriate action, including seeking a protective order, in order to prevent the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information from passing into the public domain or becoming generally available to the public.   12.3 Publicity. The Parties agree to make a joint public release of the having entered into this Agreement upon the successful completion of Phase I as described in Exhibit F. The public release must however not contain any Confidential Information of any kind such as scientific, commercial or financial which both Parties have not agreed to include in writing. No public announcement concerning the existence, terms or subject matter of this Agreement shall be made, either directly or indirectly, by any Party, without first obtaining the prior written approval of the other Party and agreement upon the nature and text of such public announcement which such agreement and approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, in the opinion of legal counsel for the Party desiring to make such public announcement, such disclosure is required under Applicable Law, subject to Section 12.2 (Permitted Disclosure) above, the Party required to make such public announcement shall inform the other Parties of the proposed announcement or disclosure in reasonably sufficient time prior to public release, which shall be not

The Receiving Party shall reasonably cooperate with the Disclosing Party (at the Disclosing Party's expense) with respect to all disclosures regarding this Agreement required under Applicable Law, including requests for confidential treatment of proprietary information of the Disclosing Party included in any such disclosure.    12.4 Applicable Law. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as preventing or in any way inhibiting any Party from complying with Applicable Law governing activities and obligations undertaken pursuant to this Agreement, in any manner which it reasonably deems appropriate, including, for example, by disclosing to Regulatory Authorities confidential or other information received from the other Parties, subject to Sections 12.2 (Permitted Disclosure) and 12.3 (Publicity).   12.5 Non-Use of Names. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, neither Party (or its Affiliates) shall use, either directly or indirectly, the Trademarks of the other Party (or their Affiliates), or the names of any of their officers, employees or board members in any publicity, marketing advertising or other documents (or other disclosures) unless (a) such use is consistent with, and permitted under, the Project Plan or (b) a copy or transcript of the proposed disclosure is submitted to and approved in advance in writing by the other Party (each in its sole discretion), except in the case in which a governmental authority requires the use of the Trademark by a Party in the sale or distribution of the Assay or Plazomicin. Each Party will use good faith efforts to review and approve any proposed disclosure within [***] ([***]) business days of its receipt from the other Party of a copy or transcript of the proposed disclosure. If a Party approves the other Party's usage of its Trademarks (or its Affiliates), or the names of any of their officers, employees or board members in accordance with this Section 12.5 (Non-Use of Names), the other Party shall comply with any usage guidelines or requirements imposed by the approving Party.   12.6 Publications. Publication in a journal, paper, magazine or any other such similar disclosure relating to the development, manufacture or commercialization of the Assay will not take place without the prior written agreement of both Achaogen and Microgenics, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Any draft article intended to be submitted for publication by Microgenics or Achaogen (or a clinical trial site utilized by Achaogen) hereto shall first be sent to the other Party in order to allow such Party to preserve its intellectual property rights by delaying such publication (but not for more than  [***] ([***]) days) and/or removing its Confidential Information. Achaogen's and/or Microgenics' contribution shall be acknowledged in any publication by co-authorship or acknowledgment, whichever is appropriate. Republication of any article, in whole or in part, which has previously been approved by the Parties shall not require subsequent approval, provided that the content is substantially unchanged. These restrictions are not applicable to Plazomicin; provided, however, that, for clarity, Microgenics shall have no right to publish with respect to Plazomicin.   12.7 Prior CDAs. This Agreement supersedes that certain Confidential Disclosure Agreement between the Parties dated  [***]; provided, however, that all Confidential Information disclosed or received by the Parties thereunder will be deemed Confidential Information hereunder and will be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

Confidential Treatment Requested by Achaogen, Inc.   performance of the obligations on its part contained in this Agreement if and to the extent that such failure or delay is due to government action, war, terrorism, fire, explosion, flood, strike, lockout, embargo, shortage of materials or utilities, vendor failure to supply, act of God, or any other cause beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the defaulting Party (a "Force Majeure Event"), provided that the Party claiming Force Majeure Event has exerted all Commercially Reasonable Efforts to avoid or remedy such force majeure. Such excuse shall continue as long as the condition preventing the performance continues. Upon cessation of such Force Majeure Event, the affected Party shall promptly resume performance hereunder. Each Party agrees to give the other Party prompt written notice of the occurrence of any such Force Majeure Event, the nature thereof, and the extent to which the affected Party will be unable to perform its obligations hereunder. Each Party further agrees to use all Commercially Reasonable Efforts to correct the Force Majeure Event  [***] and to give the other Party prompt written notice when it is again fully able to perform its obligations hereunder.   13.2 Assignment. Neither Party may assign this Agreement to a Third Party unless both Parties have agreed to such assignment in a writing signed by an authorized representative of each Party hereto; provided, however, that upon providing written notice, (i) either Party may, without the other Party's consent, assign this Agreement to an Affiliate or to any Third Party entity that acquires all or substantially all of its assets to which this Agreement relates and (ii) Achaogen may, without Microgenics' consent, assign this Agreement (in whole or in part) to a Third Party licensee of Achaogen's rights with respect to Plazomicin. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the successors and permitted assigns of the Parties. Any assignment not in accordance with this Section 13.2 (Assignment) shall be void.   13.3 No Waiver. The failure of either Party to require performance by the other Party of any of that other Party's obligations hereunder shall in no manner affect the right of such Party to enforce the same at a later time. No waiver by any Party hereto of any condition, or the breach of any provision, term, representation or warranty contained in this Agreement, whether by conduct or otherwise, in any one or more instances, shall be deemed to be or construed as a further or continuing waiver of any such condition or breach, or of any other condition or of the breach of any other provision, term, representation or warranty hereof.   13.4 Severability.  If a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction should hold any term or provision of this Agreement to be excessive, or invalid, void or unenforceable, the offending term or provision shall be deleted, and, if possible, replaced by a term or provision which, so far as practicable, achieves the legitimate aims of the Parties. In the event that such provisions cannot be agreed upon, the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of one or more provision of this Agreement shall not affect the validity of this Agreement as a whole.   13.5 Relationship Between the Parties. Both Parties are independent contractors under this Agreement. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to create an employment, agency, joint venture or partnership relationship between the Parties hereto or any of their agents or employees, or any other legal arrangement that would impose liability upon one Party for the act or failure to act of the other Party. Neither Party shall have any express or implied power to enter into any contracts or commitments or to incur any liabilities in the name of, or on behalf of, the other Party, or to bind the other Party in any respect whatsoever.

  (a) Any dispute arising under or related to this Agreement which relates to a matter for which Achaogen has recourse against the Government under the Achaogen Government Contract (also hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "Prime Contract") shall be resolved as follows unless the Parties otherwise agree in writing.

  (b) Microgenics shall give Achaogen a fully supported written request for equitable adjustment or claim concerning any such dispute within [***] years after the basis of the equitable adjustment arises or claim accrues, but in no event later than [***], or Microgenics shall be barred from any remedy for such claim.

  (c) Achaogen shall forward such request for equitable adjustment or claim to the Contracting Officer on Microgenics's behalf for final decision, subject to the limitations and other conditions contained in this provision. Achaogen shall in good faith consult with Microgenics concerning the forwarding of such request for equitable adjustment or claim to the Contracting Officer.

  (d) Any final decision of the Contracting Officer under the Prime Contract as it relates to this Agreement, whether or not it results from a claim under Section 3.1(b) and (c) of this Agreement submitted on Microgenics's behalf under the provision stated above, shall be binding upon Microgenics; provided however, that Achaogen shall notify Microgenics immediately of any such final decision of the Contracting Officer and if: (i) Achaogen elects not to appeal such decision pursuant to the

  "Disputes" clause of the Prime Contract; (ii) Achaogen thereafter receives, no less than [***] ([***]) days before the expiration of the period of appeal under the "Disputes" clause of the Prime Contract, a written request by Microgenics to appeal such decision, and (iii) Achaogen has the right of such appeal under the Prime Contract, then Achaogen shall file an appeal from the final decision on Microgenics's behalf.

  (e) If Achaogen appeals such a decision, whether at its election or at Microgenics's request, any decision upon such appeal by the Board of Contract Appeals, the United States Court of Federal Claims, or any other board or agency having jurisdiction over the appeal shall be binding upon Microgenics insofar as it relates to a claim under this Section 3.1 of this Agreement, provided however, that if Microgenics timely (i.e., no less than [***] ([***]) days before the expiration of the relevant period of appeal) requests Achaogen to bring a further appeal to obtain judicial review of such final decision by a court of competent jurisdiction, Achaogen shall do so, subject to the terms below. A final judgment in any such further appeal, if binding on Achaogen under the Prime Contract, shall in turn be binding on Microgenics insofar as it relates to a claim under this Section 3.1 of this Agreement.

  (f) In any appeal brought by Achaogen on behalf of Microgenics, or at Microgenics's request under the above provisions, [***] shall bear all costs and expenses incurred by Microgenics in prosecuting such appeal, including but not limited to, any legal fees or costs incurred. In any appeal taken or brought by Achaogen, whether at its election or at Microgenics request, Microgenics shall cooperate fully with Achaogen in its prosecution thereof in every reasonable manner and Microgenics shall be afforded reasonable opportunity to participate in the prosecution thereof to the extent Microgenics's interest may be affected. To the extent requested by Achaogen, Microgenics shall prosecute for Achaogen any appeal taken or brought at Microgenics request and, in such event, Achaogen shall assist Microgenics in every reasonable manner.

  (g) If Achaogen is required to certify any claim of Microgenics, Achaogen shall not forward such claim unless it is reasonably satisfied the claim is in good faith, and Achaogen can certify such claim to the Contracting Officer to the extent and manner required by the Contract Disputes Act, as applicable. Microgenics agrees to provide Achaogen with such information as Achaogen reasonably may deem necessary to make this determination, including but not limited to, its own certification in the form prescribed by the Contract Disputes Act or its implementing regulations. Such certification shall be executed by a person duly authorized to bind Microgenics. Microgenics agrees that, with respect to any claim or dispute that arises under or relates to the Prime Contract which, if it were Achaogen's claim, can properly be submitted for a decision of the Contracting Officer under the "Disputes" clause, its right of claim or appeal is limited to the procedures set forth in this provision.

  (h) Microgenics's failure to comply with the terms of this provision shall entitle Achaogen to terminate any such appeal on Microgenics's behalf. The rights and obligations described herein shall survive completion of and final payment under this Disputes section.

Prime Contract Provision

Clause

H.19: Information on Compliance With Animal Care Requirements

Registration with the U.S. Dept. of Agriculture (USDA) is required to use regulated species of animals for biomedical purposes. USDA is responsible for the enforcement of the Animal Welfare Act (7 U.S.C. 2131 et. seq), http://www.nal.usda.gov/awic/legislat/awa.htm

The Public Health Service (PHS) Policy is administered by the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW) http://grants2.nih.gov/grants/olaw/olaw.htm. An essential requirement of the PHS Policy, http://grants2.nih.gov/grants/olaw/references/phspol.htm is that every institution using live vertebrate animals must obtain an approved assurance from OLAW before they can receive funding from any component of the U.S. Public Health Service.

The PHS Policy requires that Assured institutions base their programs of animal care and use on the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals http://www.nap.edu/readingroom/books/labrats/ and that they comply with the regulations (9 C.F.R., subchapter A) http://www.nal.usda.gov/awic/legislat/usdaleg1.htm issued by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) under the Animal Welfare Act. The Guide may differ from USDA regulations in some respects. Compliance with USDA regulations is an absolute requirement of this Policy.

The Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC) http://www.aaalac.org is a professional organization that inspects and evaluates programs of animal care institutions at their request. Those that meet the high standards are given accredited status. As of the 2002 revision of the PHS policy, the only accrediting body recognized by PHS is the AAALAC. While AAALAC Accreditation is not required to conduct biomedical research, it is highly desirable. AAALAC uses the Guide as their primary evaluation tool. They also use the Guide for the Care and Use of Agricultural Animals in Agricultural Research and Teaching. It is published by the American Science Societies. http://www.fass.org.

Prime Contract Provision

Clause

H.20: Requirements for Adequate Assurance of Protection of Vertebrate Animal Subjects

The PHYS Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals requires that applicant organizations proposing to use vertebrate animals file a written Animal Welfare Assurance with the Office for Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW), establishing appropriate policies and procedures to ensure the humane care and use of live vertebrate animals involved in research activities supported by the PHS. The PHS Policy stipulates that an applicant organization, whether domestic or foreign, bears responsibility for the humane care and use of animals in PHS-supported research activities. Also the PHS policy defines "animal" as "any live, vertebrate animal used, or intended for use, in research, research training, experimentation, biological testing or for related purposes." This policy implements and supplements the U.S. Government Principles for the Utilization and Care of Vertebrate Animals Used in Testing, Research, and Training, and requires that institutions use the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals as a basis for developing and implementing an institutional animal care use program. This Policy does not affect applicable State or local laws or regulations that impose more stringent standards for the care and use of laboratory animals. All institutions are required to comply, as applicable, with the Animal Welfare Act, as amended and other Federal statutes and regulations relating to animals. These documents are available from the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, (301) 496-7163. http://grants.nih.gov/grants/olaw/olaw.htm.

No PHYS supported work or research involving vertebrate animals will be conducted by an organization, unless that organization is operating in accordance with an approved Animal Welfare Assurance and provides verification that the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) has reviewed and approved the proposed activity in accordance with the PHS policy. Applications may be referred by the PHS back to the institution for further review in the case of an apparent or potential violations of the PHS policy. No award to an individual will be made unless that individual is affiliated with an assured organization that accepts responsibility for compliance with the PHS Policy. Foreign applicant organizations applying for PHS awards for activities involving vertebrate animals are required to comply with PHS Policy or provide evidence that acceptable standards for the humane care and use of animals will be met. Foreign applicant organizations are not required to submit IACUC approval, but should provide information that is satisfactory to the Government to provide assurances for the humane care of such animals.

H.21: Approval of Required Assurance by OLAW

Under governing regulations, federal funds which are administered by DHHS, Office of Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) shall not be expended by the contractor for research involving live vertebrate animals, nor shall live vertebrate animals be involved in research activities by Company under this award unless a satisfactory assurance of compliance with 7 U.S.C. 2316 and 9 CFR Sections 2.25-2.28 is submitted within 30 days of the date of this award and approved by the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW). Each performance site (if any) must also assure compliance, with the following restriction: Only activities which do not directly involve live vertebrate animals (i.e., are clearly severable and independent from those activities) may be conducted by the contractor or individual performance sites pending OLAW approval of their respective assurance of compliance.

Clause

H.22: Registration with the Select Agent Program for Work involving the possession, use, and/or transfer of select biological agents or toxins

Company shall not conduct work involving select agents or toxins under this contract until it and any associated subcontractor(s) comply with the following:
