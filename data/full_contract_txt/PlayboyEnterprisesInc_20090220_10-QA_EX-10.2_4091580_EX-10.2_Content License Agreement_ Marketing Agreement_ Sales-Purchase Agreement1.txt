Royalty on Shipping Charges. In addition, Client shall be entitled to receive a royalty payment on the shipping and  handling charges paid by customers during the applicable Calendar Quarter ("Shipping Royalty") equal to the Royalty percentage  multiplied by the shipping profit.

EFS must obtain Client's written approval of each stage of development before  proceeding to the next stage, and in no event shall EFS commence or permit the mass manufacture, advertising, promotion,  sale or distribution of any EFS Produced Merchandise or Materials unless and until EFS has received Client's written  approval of the samples provided pursuant to (iii) of this Section 1. In the event Client fails to provide its approval or  disapproval of any or all things submitted to Client pursuant to this Section 1 within ***** of Client's receipt thereof, EFS  may send written notice to Client advising no response was received. If Client does not respond within ***** of Client's  receipt thereof, then Client shall be deemed to have given disapproval.    2.

Client and its nominees, employees, agents and representatives shall have the right to enter  upon and inspect, at all reasonable hours of the day, any and all such location(s) and to take, without payment, individual  samples of any of the EFS Produced Merchandise and the Materials as Client reasonably requires for the purposes of such  inspection.    3. If any of the EFS Produced Merchandise or Materials sent or taken pursuant to Section 2 of this Exhibit 9 above or that  otherwise come to the attention of Client does or do not conform in Client's sole opinion to the previously approved samples,  Client shall so notify EFS, in writing, specifying in what respect such of the EFS Produced Merchandise or Materials is or are  unacceptable.
