    (i)  If the other party accepts or does not answer within this time frame,           the Billing Party will be entitled to make such payment/withholding           and shall provide the other party with a certificate stating the           amounts withheld and the jurisdictions to which such amounts were           remitted.

Either Party shall pay any applicable sales or value added tax on the payments due.

                 5.4 Share of Net Revenue. As financial consideration under this Agreement, Net Revenue will be shared by the parties as follows:

                 (a)   For so long as PlanetCAD hosts the Co-Branded Service,                         during which time PlanetCAD shall be the Billing Party,                         all Net Revenue derived from sales of the Co-Branded                         Service to Dassault Systemes Customers shall be                         apportioned [***] percent ([***]%) to Dassault Systems                         and [***] percent ([***]%) to PlanetCAD.

                 5.5 Net Revenue Defined. Net Revenue shall consist of all revenues recognized by the Billing Party derived from supply of the Co-Branded Service, including the price paid by the customers, less any applicable discounts and net of any commissions or fees paid to third party resellers, to obtain access to the Co-Branded Service and any other fees and charges invoiced by the Billing Party to the customers, without deduction by such party of any other costs or expenses related to achievement of the revenue, provided, however, that Net

                                      7    8 Revenue shall be reduced by the amount, if any, of (i) value-added taxes, (ii) sales taxes or (iii) withholding taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on payments made by a payor in such jurisdiction to a payee outside of such jurisdiction.

                 5.6 Reporting and Payment Obligations. Within 7 Business Days after the end of each calendar quarter, the Billing Party shall provide the other party with an itemized statement, subject to adjustment within 30 days of receipt of such statement, setting forth the Net Revenue achieved over the preceding calendar quarter, and shall include such other information as may be mutually agreed upon by the parties (the "Revenue Report").

Otherwise, payment shall be made in US dollars as provided for in Section 5.2  [Pricing of the Co-Branded Service]. In the event that the Billing Party is unable under foreign currency export controls or similar applicable laws, unknown to the parties at the time where they agree on payments in that currency, to provide payment to the Non-Billing Party in the currency received by the Billing Party the parties agree to negotiate a mutually agreeable solution. A party's right to payment shall accrue upon the date the corresponding revenues accrue to the Billing Party. The parties shall pay interest for late payment of any sum due at the LIBOR rate plus four points (not to exceed the maximum rate authorized, or be inferior to the minimum rate allowed, by applicable law, as the case may be).

                 5.7 Records - Audit. The Billing Party shall, for two years following each transaction relating to the Co-Branded Service, keep true and accurate records and books of account of such transaction containing all particulars which may be necessary for the purpose of auditing payments to the Non-Billing Party under this Agreement.

The Billing Party will bear the costs of such audit if a discrepancy

                 11.4 Irreparable Injury. Each party acknowledges and agrees that each covenant in this Agreement pertaining to confidential information and ownership of intellectual property is reasonable and necessary to protect and preserve the rights of the other party in its confidential information and intellectual property, and that any breach by such party of the terms of this Agreement may result in irreparable injury to the other party. Each party, therefore, subject to a claim of laches, estoppel, acquiescence or other delay in seeking relief, consents and agrees that the other party shall be entitled to seek and obtain a temporary restraining order and a permanent injunction to prevent a breach or contemplated breach of this Agreement and waives any requirement that the other party post a bond in connection with seeking such injunctive relief.
