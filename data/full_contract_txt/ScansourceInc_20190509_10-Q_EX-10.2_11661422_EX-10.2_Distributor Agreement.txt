EXHIBIT B Operational Terms for Purchase of Xplore Products

ARTICLE I. PURCHASE ORDERS AND STOCK ON HAND

1. Issuance and Acceptance of Purchase Order. To order the Xplore Products, Distributor shall place a purchase order via sending an email to xpldistributors@zebra.com. Each purchase order shall specify the bill-to address, ship-to address, quantity and description of each Xplore Product ordered, the unit price for each Xplore Product, the requested ship date, the preferred means of delivery, and tax-exempt certifications, if any. Orders received without this information or which contain any discrepancy may be returned to Distributor for completion or revision as applicable. Each purchase order placed by Distributor, as well as each invoice sent by Xplore, shall be governed by the terms of this Addendum and the Distribution Agreement and any additional or different terms within the purchase order or invoice shall have no effect. Each purchase order for the Xplore Products shall be subject to Xplore's acceptance and, upon acceptance, Xplore shall confirm the purchase order and the Estimated Shipping Date with Distributor. Notwithstanding such acceptance, Xplore reserves the right where necessary to amend the Orders including without limitation part numbers, special pricing and Estimated Shipping Date, and may at its sole discretion require an amended Order from Distributor incorporating such changes. For the purposes of this Exhibit B, "Estimated Shipping Date" shall mean the estimated shipping date of an accepted purchase order.

2. Purchase Order Rescheduling, Cancellation and Modification. Distributor has the right to cancel, reschedule or modify all or any portion of a purchase order that has been accepted by Xplore at no cost to Distributor only if such cancellation or modification request is made within [*****] business days of PO acceptance or rescheduling request is made at least [*****] business days prior to the most current Estimated Shipping Date for that purchase order. Distributor has the right to change the destination of all or any portion of a purchase order that has been accepted by Xplore at no cost to Distributor only if such change in destination request is made at least [*****] business days prior to the most current Estimated Shipping Date for that purchase order. Except as set forth above, purchase orders are non-changeable and non- cancellable by Distributor, once accepted by Xplore.

Certain purchase orders, determined at Xplore's sole discretion, and generally of large volume and/or extended lead times, may be subject to alternative rescheduling, cancellation, and modification rights. Should such purchase orders be subject to alternative rights, Xplore shall inform Distributor of alternative rights prior to order acceptance. Distributor will then have [*****] business days to accept, or reject, the alternative terms of Xplore for that certain purchase order. If Distributor rejects such alternative terms, the purchase order will not be accepted by Xplore.

3. Product Allocation. If for any reason, Xplore's production is not on schedule, Xplore may, at its sole and absolute discretion, allocate available inventory to Distributor and make shipments in accordance with Zebra's then current processes.

4. Stock on Hand. Distributor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain thirty (30) days of stock in Distributor's inventory to support sales. Xplore acknowledges that from time to time, Distributor's inventory levels may fall below the thirty (30) days goal that is agreed upon by both Parties. If inventory levels fall below the thirty (30) day goal for more than sixty (60) consecutive days, Xplore, upon written notice to Distributor, shall replenish the stock to an amount agreed by both Parties.

5. Product Return and Stock Rotation. The terms of Section 3 of Schedule 2 of the Distribution Agreement will apply to Xplore Products, provided however that stock rotation allowance for Xplore Products will be based on the net dollar value of Distributor's purchases in each calendar quarter of Xplore Products and such allowance will be calculated separate and apart from all other Products purchased by Distributor during such period.

ARTICLE II. DELIVERY OF PRODUCTS

1. Shipping Terms. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Distribution Agreement, and unless notified by Xplore otherwise, shipping terms for Xplore Products will be Delivery Duty Paid (DDP) INCOTERMS® 2010, whereby Distributor's price, includes all costs of delivery, insurance, import and / or export duties and tariffs. Such prices are exclusive of all federal, state, municipal or other government excise, sales, use, occupational or like taxes in force, and any such taxes shall be assumed and paid for by Distributor in addition to its payment for the Xplore Products. Title and risk of loss to Xplore Products shall pass to Distributor upon delivery to Distributor, as indicated in the Proof of Delivery (PoD) documents. [*****]

1. At Distributor's request, Xplore may deliver Xplore Products directly to Program Members or their respective End Users on behalf of Distributor, and in such instances title and risk of loss will pass to Distributor upon delivery to the applicable recipients, as indicated on the PoD documents. Some exclusions may apply, including countries not served by Xplore shipping and importing methods, and/or countries where Xplore Products, are not certified for resale and/or use.
