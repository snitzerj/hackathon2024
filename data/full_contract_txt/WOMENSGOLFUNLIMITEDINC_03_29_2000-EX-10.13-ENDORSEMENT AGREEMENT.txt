If the Professional is unable at any time during the Term to provide such endorsement of the Products, the Company shall be released from any of its obligations under Sections 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3 hereof to pay any fees or royalties or to provide any stock options to the Professional and may elect to terminate this Agreement without any further obligation to the Professional.

4.       COMPENSATION FOR ENDORSEMENT SERVICES.

         4.1 The Company will pay the Professional a base fee of thirty-six thousand dollars ($36,000) per year (the "Base Fee") for Services performed during the Term. The Company shall pay the Base Fee in four (4) equal installments of nine thousand dollars ($9,000) each on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of each year during the Term commencing on January 15, 2000. The Professional acknowledges that the Company is under no obligation to create or maintain the Products. The Professional agrees that payment of the Base Fee shall satisfy all obligations of the Company hereunder if it elects not to create or market and sell the Products.

         4.2 If the Company elects to create and market the Products, the Company will pay to the Professional a "Royalty Fee" on the sales of Products during the Term, except as provided in the following sentence, of two percent (2%) of the "Royalty Base," which Royalty Base shall be calculated as the wholesale selling price of all Products for which the Company actually receives the proceeds of such net of returns, allowances, discounts, shipping, taxes, insurance and credits. During the Term, the Company shall pay the Royalty Fee, earned for the preceding quarter, to the Professional quarterly, within thirty (30) days of the end of the succeeding calendar year quarter. If the Company decides not to renew this Agreement in accordance with the provisions of Section 8 below, the Company shall pay the Professional an amount equal to two percent (2%) of the net book value of its unsold inventory of Products on December 31, 2004.

         4.3 If the Company elects to create and market the Products, the Company will grant to the Professional options to purchase shares of the Company's capital stock ("Options"), as provided in this paragraph. On each March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31 during the Term that the Company elects to continue the marketing and sale of the Products, the Company will grant to the Professional a number of Options (the "Quarterly Grant Number").

                                      -3-    4

                                                                  EXECUTION COPY

The Quarterly Grant Number shall be the nearest whole number that results from the division of the number of dollars represented by one half of one percent





(0.5%) of the Royalty Base by the closing price of the Company's stock on the grant date. The exercise price of the Options shall be the closing price of the Company stock on the grant date. The sum of the Quarterly Grant Numbers in each calendar year of the Term shall not exceed fifteen thousand (15,000). The options will expire five (5) years after each grant date. The Options shall not be assigned, transferred or alienated by the Professional. Any attempt to assign, transfer or alienate the Options without the prior written consent of the Company shall be void.

         4.4 The Company will reimburse the Professional for her reasonable and necessary travel expenses in connection with her performance of the Services.

         4.5 The Company shall be under no obligation to create, market, promote or sell the Products. There shall be no minimum amounts due from the Company hereunder except as specified in Section 4.1 above. The failure of the Company to create, market, promote or sell the Products or to reach any specific sales volume shall not result in any liability of the Company or create any right for the Professional to make a claim against the Company. The Company may elect to dispose of the Products at any price or for no consideration in its sole discretion and shall not be obligated to the Professional for any sale or transfer of the Products which does not produce compensation for the Professional.

5.       PROFESSIONAL'S CONDUCT.

         5.1      The Professional shall at all times during the Term refrain                   from:

                  5.1.1    dishonest, fraudulent, illegal or unethical acts or          omissions;

                  5.1.2    excessive use or abuse of alcohol;

                  5.1.3    use of controlled substances, except as prescribed by          a licensed medical professional in the treatment of illness or disease;

                  5.1.4    acts or omissions reasonably determined by the          Company to be prejudicial or injurious to the business or goodwill of          the Company, its officers, employees, shareholders or products, the          golf industry or professional golf; and

                  5.1.5    conduct which could reasonably be expected to degrade          the Professional, devalue the services of the Professional or to          bring the Professional into public hatred, contempt, scorn or          ridicule, or that could reasonably be expected to shock, insult or          offend the community or to offend public morals or decency.

6.       INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR.

         6.1 With respect to all Services described in this Agreement, the Professional's status will be that of an independent contractor and not a partner, employee or agent of the Company. The Professional has no power or authority whatsoever to make binding commitments or

                                                                  EXECUTION COPY

contracts on behalf of the Company. The Professional agrees that she will pay and hold the Company harmless from any and all costs, expenses, fees, dues, pension contributions, benefit contributions and fines associated with her present or future required membership in any trade association, union or professional organization, including but not limited to LPGA, PGA, USGA, SAG or AFTRA, that may be associated with her performance of this Agreement. The Professional represents that no agent or representative fees, charges, rights or claims exist in connection with her execution or performance of this Agreement, and the Professional shall hold harmless the Company from any such liability. Any costs incurred by the Company to comply with any rule, contract, order or other requirement of SAG, AFTRA or other union or professional organization having control or jurisdiction over the Professional or her performance of the services required by this Agreement shall be deducted from the sums due from the Company to the Professional. The Professional agrees that the compensation provided to her under Section 4 of this Agreement shall be deemed compensation for purposes of meeting any minimum pay requirements of any SAG or AFTRA agreement. If any of the above terms are deemed to violate any SAG or AFTRA agreement, the Company shall have the option to terminate this Agreement without liability.

         6.2 The Professional shall have no authority to incur expenses on behalf of the Company without the Company's prior written approval. The Professional shall submit to the Company for written approval a description of anticipated expenses, other than those for reasonable and necessary travel, prior to incurring such expenses. All statements submitted by the Professional for expenses that were not pre-approved by the Company will be subject to review, approval or rejection by the Company in its sole discretion.

         6.3 The Professional will be solely responsible for withholding and paying any and all federal, state and local taxes, including but not limited to payroll, unemployment, social security and income taxes, and any other payments which may be due as a result of or in connection with payments made by the Company for services rendered under this Agreement. The Professional acknowledges that she is not qualified for and will not receive any Company employee benefits or other incidents of employment.





         6.4 The Professional agrees to maintain at all times during the Term such insurance, including without limitation, health insurance, workers' compensation, automobile and general comprehensive liability coverage, as will protect and hold harmless the Company from any claims, losses, damages, costs, expenses or liability arising out of the Services performed under this Agreement. The Company may require the Professional to provide insurance certificates evidencing the same.

         6.5      The Professional represents and warrants that:

                  6.5.1    The Professional has the right to enter into this                            Agreement;

                  6.5.2    By agreeing to perform or performing this Agreement,          the Professional will not breach any existing agreement; and

                                      -5-    6

                                                                  EXECUTION COPY

                  6.5.3 Neither the Professional's grant of rights to the          Company under this Agreement nor the Company's exercise of such rights          will cause the infringement of any rights of third parties.

         6.6 The Professional agrees not to enter into any other agreement the performance of which would or could cause an infringement of the rights that the Professional grants to the Company under this Agreement.

7.       TERMINATION.

         7.1 This Agreement shall terminate automatically if the Professional dies or becomes disabled, or suffers illness, mental or physical disability to the extent that she is unable to perform the obligations of the Professional under the terms of this Agreement.

         7.2 Either the Company or the Professional may terminate this Agreement in the event of a non-curable breach of this Agreement by the other party.

         7.3 In case of a breach of the Agreement that is capable of being cured, the non-breaching party shall, before terminating the Agreement, give the breaching party written notice of such breach, and a thirty (30) day period in which to cure such breach.

         7.4 The Professional's obligations under (i) Section 9 hereof and (ii) Exhibit A shall survive a termination of this Agreement for the applicable periods set forth therein. The Company's obligation to compensate the Professional pursuant to Section 4 of this Agreement shall cease on the effective date of termination except as to amounts earned by the Professional and due from the Company accruing prior to such date.

         7.5 The right to terminate outlined in this section shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, all other remedies which may be available to the non-breaching party, whether at law or in equity, for a breach of this Agreement.

8.       RENEWAL.

         8.1 The Company may renew this Agreement on the same terms and conditions for one (1) additional five year period that shall begin on January 1, 2005 and end on December 31, 2009, by providing a written notice of its intent to effect such renewal to the Professional by November 30, 2004.

9.       NON-COMPETITION.

         9.1 The Professional acknowledges that any use of her name, likeness, image or personal identification by any third party in connection with the making, use, sale, marketing, promotion or advertising of golf equipment, including but not limited to golf clubs and golf bags, would cause a likelihood of confusion with the Products of the Company, during the Term and thereafter during the time the Company disposes of inventory on hand at the expiration of this Agreement. The Professional acknowledges that she will have a right, pursuant to and under the

                                      -6-    7

                                                                  EXECUTION COPY

conditions described in Section 4.2 above, to receive a specified royalty for inventory on hand at the expiration of the initial term, and accordingly hereby grants to the Company the right to fill any orders for, assemble components of, market, advertise, promote and sell any inventory of Products in its inventory existing at the expiration or termination of this Agreement, for a period not to exceed two (2) years after such expiration or termination of the original term. To avoid any possibility of confusion of the public, trademark infringement or interference with the rights of the Company, the Professional agrees not to endorse, license or otherwise authorize the use of her name, likeness or image in connection with another company's golf clubs or golf-related clothing or equipment during the Term and for a period of two (2) years thereafter.

         9.2 The Professional agrees to divest herself of any management or control interest that she currently has in any entity that is a competitor of





the Company, and not to acquire any such interest during the Term.

10.      RIGHT OF INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.

         10.1 The Professional acknowledges and agrees that a breach of the covenants contained in Section 9 of this Agreement would actually or potentially deprive the Company of a substantial amount of sales and business value and that the amount of injury would be impossible or difficult to ascertain fully. The Company shall, therefore, be entitled to obtain an injunction against the Professional restraining any violation, further violation, or threatened violation of Section 9 above, in addition to any other remedies to which the Company may be entitled by law.

11.      MISCELLANEOUS.

         11.1. ENFORCEABILITY. The unenforceability or invalidity of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect the enforceability or validity of the balance of the Agreement. In the event that any such provision should be or becomes invalid for any reason, such provision shall remain effective to the maximum extent permissible, and the parties shall consult and agree on a legally acceptable modification giving effect to the commercial objectives of the unenforceable or invalid provision, and every other provision of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.

         11.2. ASSIGNABILITY. This Agreement is not assignable by the Professional but is assignable by the Company to any affiliate or successor entity.

The waiver by any          party of any right arising out of any breach by the other party shall          not be construed as a waiver of any right arising out of a subsequent          breach.

                  11.4. GOVERNING LAW. The validity, interpretation,          construction and performance of this Agreement shall be governed in          accordance with the laws of the State of New Jersey without giving          effect to the principles of conflicts of laws of such state.
