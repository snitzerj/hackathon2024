(a) Subject to Section 3, Licensor shall forthwith provide to Rogers a comprehensive list (including title, length of program, license period and availability date) of all currently available Licensed Programs. During the Term, Licensor shall use best efforts to add newly available Licensed Programs to such list, and may periodically delete Licensed Programs from such list; provided, however, that: (i) Licensor shall provide to Rogers at least ninety (90) days prior notice of the availability date of any Licensed Program added to such list during the Term; (ii) Licensor shall provide to Rogers at least sixty (60) days prior notice of the deletion of any Licensed Program from such list; and (iii) Licensor shall be responsible for any and all reasonable costs and/or losses incurred by Rogers as a result of any deletions from such list during the Term.     (b) Rogers reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to determine which Licensed Programs to distribute and exhibit on the ROD Service and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, may decline to distribute or exhibit any Licensed Program that it determines, in its sole discretion, is unsuitable for distribution or exhibition on the ROD Service.     (c) Licensor shall use commercial reasonable efforts to provide Rogers with Licensed Programs with closed captioning.     3. AVAILABILITY DATE.     (a) Subject to Section 3(b), the availability date for any Licensed Program that is a feature-length motion picture or direct-to-video product shall be no later than ninety (90) days following the date on which such Licensed Program is made available for home video distribution within the U.S or the Territory.

VIEWING PERIOD.   The viewing period for each Licensed Program shall be at least twenty-four (24) consecutive hours, or such longer period as may be agreed to by Rogers and Licensor from time to time (the "Viewing Period").

(e) There shall be no minimum License Fee or retail viewing fee with respect to any Licensed Program. Additionally, Rogers shall not be required to pay any License Fees for VOD exhibitions of any Licensed Program occurring on or off premises that are made for the purposes of quality assurance or testing.
