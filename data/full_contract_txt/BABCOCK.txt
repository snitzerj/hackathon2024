SpinCo shall retain all proceeds of the sales of this publication.

(b) SpinCo shall have the sole right to use the title Steam/its generation and use to publish future editions of the Steam Book.

(c) The Parties acknowledge that it is desirable for future editions of the Steam Book to present a comprehensive view of how steam is generated and used from a variety of energy sources including, inter alia, nuclear energy sources. SpinCo shall have the sole right to determine the content contained in future editions of the Steam Book, provided, however, that SpinCo will provide RemainCo with a right of first refusal to collaborate with SpinCo to provide content related to nuclear subject matter in the forty-third (43rd) edition of the Steam Book, with allocation of costs and revenues and any attribution and Copyright ownership with respect to RemainCo contributed content to be negotiated in good faith by the Parties. The foregoing right of first refusal shall cease in the event of a Change of Control of either RemainCo or SpinCo, provided, however, that the Parties will discuss the feasibility of future collaboration, specifically related to the contribution of nuclear related subject matter by RemainCo, in good faith in the event of a Change of Control.

(d) RemainCo shall have, and SpinCo hereby grants to RemainCo, an unlimited, non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty free, worldwide right and license to use the content contained in the Steam Book, including the current edition and any past edition and any future edition to which RemainCo makes a contribution, for any purpose, including, without limitation, to reproduce, publicly display, modify, make derivative works, distribute, publicly perform and distribute for RemainCo's internal business purposes, including in connection with customer related activities, provided, however, that RemainCo shall (i) not use any non-nuclear content contained in the Steam Book in connection with publishing or distributing a publication which competes with the Steam Book and (ii) provide attribution and accreditation using a copyright notice having the format required by law in connection with the use of any protectable expression of the non-nuclear content contained in the Steam Book. SpinCo shall provide RemainCo with five hundred (500) copies of the current edition of the Steam Book at no cost to RemainCo, which copies RemainCo may distribute without limitation, including to RemainCo customers at no charge. In the event that RemainCo wishes to order additional copies of the current edition of the Steam Book or has a desire to purchase existing stock of earlier editions of the Steam Book, SpinCo will sell such copies to RemainCo at cost, which copies RemainCo may distribute without limitation, including to RemainCo customers at no charge.

ARTICLE III

TRADEMARKS

Section 3.1 House Marks.

(a) RemainCo agrees and acknowledges that (i) as of Distribution Date, as between the RemainCo Group and the SpinCo Group, all right, title and interest in and to the Trademarks set forth on Schedule 3.1 (the "SpinCo Trademarks"), including the SpinCo House Marks, shall be the sole and exclusive property of the SpinCo Group and (ii) except as otherwise provided in Section 3.2, the RemainCo Group shall cease and discontinue all use of the SpinCo Marks, including the SpinCo House Marks, as of the Distribution Date. In addition, RemainCo agrees to use its best efforts to change its name to eliminate Babcock & Wilcox therefrom, and, if applicable, to cause the members of the RemainCo Group to change their names to eliminate "Babcock," "Wilcox," "Babcock and Wilcox," "Babcock & Wilcox" or "B&W" therefrom and to cease and discontinue the use of the term "Babcock & Wilcox" or "B&W" and any of the   8





SpinCo Marks in its business or operations as promptly as practicable following the Distribution Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, SpinCo agrees and acknowledges that RemainCo will change its name to BWX Technologies and that RemainCo and the RemainCo Group may continue to use "BW" and derivations thereof and therefrom (but not "B&W") in its business or operations after the Distribution Date. SpinCo agrees not to, and shall not permit any member of the SpinCo Group to, oppose, petition to cancel, or otherwise challenge or object to the use of or any current application and/or subsequent application for registration by RemainCo or any member of the RemainCo Group of any RemainCo House Marks as long as such use and/or registration does not make use of the SpinCo House Marks and further agrees to take such actions as may be reasonably requested by RemainCo and execute or cause to be executed by the appropriate members of the SpinCo Group such other agreements, instruments and other documents, including coexistence agreements and letters of consent, as may be reasonably requested by RemainCo to facilitate the registration and continued prosecution of RemainCo House Marks (e.g., in the event that any SpinCo House Mark is cited against an application for a RemainCo House Mark).

(b) RemainCo agrees not to, and shall not permit any member of the RemainCo Group to, oppose, petition to cancel, or otherwise challenge or object to the use of or any current application and/or subsequent application for registration by SpinCo or any member of the SpinCo Group of any SpinCo House Marks, as long as such use and/or registration does not make use of the RemainCo House Marks and further agrees to take such actions as may be reasonably requested by SpinCo and execute or cause to be executed by the appropriate members of the RemainCo Group such other agreements, instruments and other documents, including coexistence agreements and letters of consent, as may be reasonably requested by SpinCo to facilitate the registration and continued prosecution of SpinCo House Marks (e.g., in the event that any RemainCo House Mark is cited against an application for a SpinCo House Mark).

Section 3.2 Limited License to Use SpinCo House Marks. RemainCo shall have the right to use the SpinCo House Marks in connection with the operation of the RemainCo Business for a limited period of 270 days following the Distribution Date. After such 270-day period, RemainCo shall discontinue all use of the SpinCo House Marks, including any use on stationery or letterhead and any use on or in connection with other RemainCo Assets. However, the Parties agree that the RemainCo Group may continue, beyond such 270-day period, to distribute copies of any existing inventory of its marketing literature, including technical papers, brochures, and printed promotional material, in existence on the Distribution Date, provided, however, that reasonable efforts are made to remove or cover up any SpinCo House Marks appearing thereon prior to distribution. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.2, in no event shall any of the members of the RemainCo Group continue to use the SpinCo House Marks (whether in any of the materials referenced in the immediately preceding sentence or otherwise) following a Change of Control of RemainCo. For the avoidance of doubt, none of the foregoing shall apply to any stationery, letterhead or marketing literature, including technical papers, brochures, and printed promotional material, distributed by any member of the RemainCo Group to its customers prior to the Distribution Date or to any SpinCo House Marks included on or in any copies of the Steam Book distributed by RemainCo or any member of the RemainCo Group prior to or after the Distribution Date. All of RemainCo's use of the SpinCo House Marks shall inure to the benefit of SpinCo. RemainCo agrees to use the SpinCo House Marks in accordance with such quality standards as are used by the SpinCo Group as of the date of this Agreement. Except as set forth in this Section 3.2, it is expressly agreed that RemainCo is not obtaining any right, title or interest in the SpinCo House Marks.   9





Section 3.3 Removal of Classes from SpinCo Marks.

(a) Within sixty (60) days from the Distribution Date, SpinCo will make all necessary filings and take all necessary actions, subject to all applicable local Laws, to (i) as applicable, amend the description of goods and services to remove references to nuclear subject matter included in any existing registration for any SpinCo House Mark registered in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, the People's Republic of China, Romania, South Korea, Vietnam, India, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, Norway, South Africa, Ukraine, the European Union and Argentina and (ii) as applicable, to amend or modify the description of goods and services to remove references to nuclear subject matter contained in any application pending for any SpinCo House Mark in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, the People's Republic of China, Romania, South Korea, Vietnam, India, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, Norway, South Africa, Ukraine, the European Union and Argentina. Without limiting the foregoing, within sixty (60) days from the Distribution Date, SpinCo will make all necessary filings and take all necessary actions, subject to all applicable local Laws, to amend the description of goods and services to remove referenced to nuclear subject matter from the registrations and applications for SpinCo House Marks listed on Schedule 3.3.

(b) Within ninety (90) days from the Distribution Date, SpinCo will make all necessary filings and take all necessary actions, subject to all applicable local Laws, to (i) as applicable, amend the description of goods and services to remove references to nuclear subject matter included in any existing registration for any SpinCo Trademarks (other than SpinCo House Marks otherwise covered by Section 3.3(a)) and (ii) as applicable, amend or modify any application pending for any SpinCo Mark (other than SpinCo House Marks otherwise covered by Section 3.3(a)) to amend the description of goods and services to remove references to nuclear subject matter contained in such application.

Section 3.4 RemainCo Marks. SpinCo agrees and acknowledges that (i) as of the Date of this Agreement, as between the SpinCo Group and the RemainCo Group, all right, title and interest in and to the Trademarks set forth on Schedule 3.4 (the "RemainCo Trademarks") shall be the sole and exclusive property of the RemainCo Group and the SpinCo Group shall cease and discontinue all use of the RemainCo Marks as of the Distribution Date.

Section 3.5 Duty to Avoid Confusion. The Parties confirm their belief that the likelihood of confusion will not result from their respective use of the SpinCo Marks and RemainCo Marks, including RemainCo's continuing use of the name BWX Technologies and continued use of the terms "BWX", "BWX Technologies" or "BWXT" and derivations thereof and therefrom, due to the differences in the goods and services primarily associated therewith (e.g., nuclear versus fossil fuel). In the event that either Party becomes aware of any actual confusion or mistake occurring as a result of their uses of their respective marks, the Parties agree to communicate all details of each such instance to each other, and to cooperate reasonably to take steps to abate the cause of confusion or mistake, and to prevent any such confusion or mistake from arising again.   10

RemainCo and SpinCo acknowledge and agree that the Shared Library Materials represent a collection of shared historical and foundational information related to and derived from more than fifty (50) years of research and development focused on technology and design criteria applicable to the businesses of RemainCo and SpinCo, which information, including all Know-How and Copyrights contained therein, has application to the businesses of RemainCo and SpinCo. The Shared Library Materials identified as of the Distribution Date are set forth on Schedule 4.1, which may be amended or modified upon mutual agreement of the Parties from time to time to (i) include additional Shared Library Materials discovered after the Distribution Date or (ii) to reflect the results of the allocation process contemplated in Section 4.4 below.

Section 4.2 Cross-License of Shared Library Materials. The Parties acknowledge and agree that each of RemainCo and SpinCo and additional members of the RemainCo Group and SpinCo Group presently have shared access to and rights to exploit the Shared Library Materials and may have a right and interest in and to certain Shared Library Materials, including in and to Intellectual Property embodied therein. Accordingly, (i) with respect to RemainCo's right and interest in and to the Shared Library Materials, RemainCo, for itself and as representative of all other members of the RemainCo Group, hereby grants to SpinCo (x) a perpetual (subject to Section 4.4), irrevocable, exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide right and license with the right to grant sublicenses (solely as set forth in Section 5.6) to use the Shared Library Materials, including all Know-How and Copyrights embodied therein, for any purpose in the SpinCo Core Field and (y) a perpetual (subject to Section 4.4), irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide right and license with the right to grant sublicenses (solely as set forth in Section 5.6) to use the Shared Library Materials, including all Know-How and Copyrights embodied therein, for any purpose in any field other than the RemainCo Core Field or the SpinCo Core Field and (ii) with respect to SpinCo's right and interest in and to the Shared Library Materials, SpinCo, for itself and as representative of all other members of the SpinCo Group, hereby grants to RemainCo (x) a perpetual (subject to Section 4.4), irrevocable, exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide right and license with the right to grant sublicenses (solely as set forth in Section 5.6) to use the Shared Library Materials, including all Know-How and Copyrights embodied therein, for any purpose in the RemainCo Core Field and (y) a perpetual (subject to Section 4.4), irrevocable, non- exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide right and license with the right to grant sublicenses (solely as set forth in Section 5.6) to use the Shared Library Materials, including all Know-How and Copyrights embodied therein, for any purpose in any field other than the SpinCo Core Field or the RemainCo Core Field. The foregoing licenses include the right to reproduce, prepare derivative works, distribute, perform and otherwise exploit such Shared Library Materials and to use the Shared Library Materials to design, develop, manufacture, have manufactured, sell and support products and services, subject in each case to applicable export control Laws and the provisions of Section 4.5.

Section 4.3 Maintenance of Shared Library Materials. Unless mutually agreed upon by the Parties in writing, all Shared Library Materials (other than those which have been allocated pursuant to Section 4.4) shall be maintained in a mutually agreed upon location accessible to both Parties (the "Shared Location") and in a manner mutually agreeable to both Parties with respect to shared access, removal and replacement of documents and similar issues.   11





(a) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties acknowledge and agree that (i) archival copies of certain Shared Library Materials are recorded on microfiche; (ii) two sets of the applicable microfiche exist as of the Distribution Time; and (iii) rather than maintaining such microfiche in a mutually agreed upon location accessible to both Parties, each Party will be entitled to maintain a copy of the microfiche at its own location, provided, however, that in the event that any Shared Library Materials are found to be missing from or otherwise inaccessible using one Party's copy of the applicable microfiche, the other Party will provide such Party with access to the microfiche in its possession for copying, with all copying costs to be paid by the Party seeking to obtain the copy.

(b) RemainCo and SpinCo agree to share all costs and expenses of maintaining the Shared Library Materials on an equal basis and to share all costs and expenses of maintaining the Shared Location as set forth in Schedule 6.3 of the Master Separation Agreement. In the event that one Party is responsible vis-a-vis a Third Party for the payment of costs and expenses related to the Shared Location, such Party will provide to the other Party a statement of all costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Shared Location as set forth in Schedule 6.3 of the Master Separation Agreement. The other Party will reimburse the responsible Party for the applicable percentage of such costs and expenses within thirty (30) days of receipt of such statement, unless otherwise agreed upon by the Parties.

(c) Without limiting this Section 4.3, the Parties agree that as of the Distribution Time, the Shared Location will be the Iron Mountain storage facility located at Boyers, Pennsylvania, which will be maintained pursuant to an agreement between RemainCo and Iron Mountain for the 137RC account and by SpinCo for the 1100 account. RemainCo and SpinCo shall share all costs and expenses related to storing the Shared Library Materials with Iron Mountain in a manner consistent with Section 4.3(b) above.

Section 4.4 Potential Allocation of Shared Library Materials. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the Shared Library Materials may contain limited material that could be allocated solely to one Party with respect to ownership and use. In the event that one Party (the "Notifying Party") discovers an item of Shared Library Material which it believes should be allocated to one Party based upon a good faith belief that such items belongs to or relates exclusively to the business of such Party, the Notifying Party will notify the other Party (the "Reviewing Party") of the item and the proposed allocation, including the Notifying Party's rationale, in writing and designate at least one representative from the relevant operating division to negotiate the proposal. The Reviewing Party will designate at least one representative from the relevant operating division to review and negotiate the proposed allocation. The Parties, including the designated representatives, shall negotiate regarding the Notifying Party's proposal in good faith. In the event that the Parties mutually agree that the Notifying Party's proposal is valid, the applicable item of Shared Library Material (i) shall be deemed to be owned by the specified Party, (ii) shall no longer constitute Shared Library Material; (iii) shall be permanently removed from the Shared Location by the specified Party and (iv) shall be removed from Schedule 4.1, provided, however, that the foregoing shall not limit a Party's existing use of any Shared Library Material or obligate any Party to cease utilizing any derivative works of such   12





Shared Library Material made prior to the date of agreement regarding the Notifying Party's proposal. In the event that the Parties do not agree that the Notifying Party's proposal is valid, the applicable item shall remain Shared Library Material under the terms of this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, the Parties agree and acknowledge that the Shared Library Materials may contain design standards and design manuals related solely to nuclear content set forth on Schedule 4.4 (collectively, the "Nuclear Design Manuals"), and that such Nuclear Design Manuals are deemed to be owned by RemainCo, subject only to SpinCo's right to confirm that such Nuclear Design Manuals, including each page therein, are marked with the engineering standards series and numbering set forth on Schedule 4.4. SpinCo's right to such confirmation is expressly limited to confirmation of the engineering standards series and numbering system contained in or on such Nuclear Design Materials for purposes of confirmation of the document's identification and does not include the right to analyze, review, or approve any of the content contained in any such Nuclear Design Manual.

Section 4.5 Confidentiality and Trade Secret Status of Shared Library Materials. The Parties acknowledge that the Research Documents contained within the Shared Library Materials likely contain proprietary trade secret information. Each Party will use reasonable efforts to maintain confidentiality of any trade secret or proprietary information contained within the Shared Library Materials in a manner materially consistent with the how the applicable Party protects its own trade secret or proprietary information.

Section 4.6 Third Party Materials Contained in the Shared Library Materials. The Parties acknowledge that the Shared Library Materials contain Third Party-owned material, including, without limitation, the Reference Materials, and this Agreement does not include any license to utilize such Third Party-owned material or any representation, warranty or indemnity from or to SpinCo or RemainCo or any member of the SpinCo Group or RemainCo Group related to the use of such Third Party-owned material in connection with the Shared Library Materials.
