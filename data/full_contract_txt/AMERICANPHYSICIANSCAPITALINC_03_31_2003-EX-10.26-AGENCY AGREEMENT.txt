         1.       Solicit within the State of Nevada, receive and transmit                   immediately and directly to MICOA, proposals for health care                   liability insurance contracts for which a commission is                   specified in the schedule of commissions provided by Exhibit                   A, attached and as amended or supplemented by such attachments                   from time to time.

         2.       Produce and deliver certificates of insurance and written                   binders in accordance with MICOA underwriting requirements.                   The Agency is not authorized to accept or bind any risk or to                   otherwise obligate MICOA without specific authority from                   MICOA.

         3.       Provide all usual and customary services of an Agency on all                   policies placed with MICOA subject to the following:

                  a.       MICOA will not be responsible for Agency expenses                            including but not limited to rent, transportation,                            employee hire or solicitor's fees, postage,                            telegrams, telephone, advertising, licensing fees or                            any other Agency expenses whatsoever.

                  b.       The Agency will not undertake or initiate advertising                            of any nature in connection with business or policies                            related to MICOA without the approval of MICOA.

         4.       To promptly report all claims and losses of which the Agency                   has knowledge and properly notify MICOA when the Agency                   receives notice of the commencement of any related legal                   action. Agency shall refrain from admitting or denying                   liability on the part of the company in connection with any                   claim or lawsuit.

         5.       In return for the exclusive appointment of Agency by MICOA to                   sell its professional liability products listed on the                  &sbsp;attached Commission Schedule

                  in Nevada, Agency agrees not to sell any competing                   professional liability products in Nevada, without the written                   consent of MICOA. Provided that, if a particular risk has been                   submitted to MICOA and MICOA has declined that risk, then                   Agency may search appropriate markets for placement of that                   risk, and may place that risk with another insurance company.

         6.       Designated Agent representatives upon request from MICOA will                   be expected to participate in MICOA's Nevada Market Managers                   Group activities and to attend all scheduled meetings.

         7.       MICOA will share on a project basis development costs of all                   promotional materials and some advertising costs related to                   Nevada sales, provided that all such expenditures or budgets                   for them are approved by MICOA in writing in advance.

         8.       Agency may solicit subagencies for appointment, subject to                   MICOA's prior written approval of each subagency following                   disclosure to and review by MICOA of information requested by                   MICOA for each proposed subagency. All such appointments by                   Agent shall stipulate that MICOA may terminate the subagency                   at any time without cause upon at least 90 days notice and                   that the subagency shall comply with all MICOA requirements                   and duties owed MICOA by Agency concerning solicitation,                   communications, and service to insureds. Subagencies shall                   also be required to submit all proposals immediately and                   directly to MICOA.

B.       MICOA BILLED POLICIES

         For business subject to Exhibit A, placed with and billed by MICOA          directly to the policyholder, the following shall apply in addition to          all the other provisions of this agreement:

         1.       The processing and submittal of all such business shall be                   subject to provisions outlined in MICOA's written requirements                   and forms as they may be implemented by MICOA from time to





                  time;

         2.       Commissions on premiums shall be paid to the Agency within 30                   business days of the month in which such premiums are received                   and recorded by MICOA, subject to deduction by MICOA of any                   return commissions due from the Agency.

         3.       Except as provided in Section D or unless authorized by the                   Agency, MICOA or its affiliates shall not use its records of                   business placed by the Agency with MICOA to solicit individual                   policyholders for the sale of other lines of

                                      -2-

                  insurance or other products or services. When the Agency                   grants such authorization, Agency shall be paid the applicable                   commission on such sales, provided an appropriate agreement is                   in place with MICOA.

         4.       If this agreement is terminated, MICOA shall, at the Agency's                   request, provide the Agency with a list of existing                   MICOA-billed policies placed by the Agency including their                   expiration dates.

         5.       The Agency's name shall appear on all policies, premium                   notices, and cancellation notices to policyholders. Copies of                   all such items sent to policyholders shall be provided by                   MICOA to the Agency.

C.       POLICY CANCELLATION

         Cancellation of any policy in force, when requested in writing by the          insured, will be honored by MICOA, except for those MICOA is not          otherwise permitted to cancel.

D.       EXPIRATIONS

         1.       In the event this Agreement is terminated for any reason,                   MICOA agrees to purchase from Agency, and Agency agrees to                   sell to MICOA Agency's ownership interest in the expirations                   for the MICOA insurance issued pursuant to this Agreement. The                   purchase price shall be two times Agency's commissions on                   business produced directly by Agency during the last 12 full                   months preceding the termination date. The purchase shall be                   completed within 60 calendar days after the termination date.                   In return for this payment, for a two-year period following                   the termination date, Agency will not directly or indirectly                   sell any professional liability insurance to any individuals                   or entities who were MICOA insureds in Nevada at the time of                   termination of this Agreement.

         2.       If Agency enters into a subagency agreement under which the                   subagency has the right to retain ownership of expirations on                   business produced by the subagency, then the purchase of                   expirations under subparagraph 1 above will not include the                   purchase of those subagency expirations, and the purchase                   price paid to Agency will not include the commissions paid for                   such business produced by the subagency.

                                      -3-

E.       AGENCY'S ERRORS AND OMISSION, AND FIDELITY & ELECTRONIC CRIME INSURANCE

         The Agency will maintain valid errors and omissions insurance, with          minimum limits of $1,000,000 per incident, and a fidelity and          electronic crime policy through an insurer, both of which shall contain          terms and limits of coverage acceptable to MICOA covering the Agency's          solicitors and each of its employees. The Agency shall provide MICOA a          copy of each policy; doing so on a regular and current basis shall be a          precondition to all of Agency's rights under this Agreement, including          but not limited to the payment of all earned commissions.

F.       TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT

         1.       This agreement shall terminate:

                  a.       Automatically if any public authority cancels or                            declines to renew the Agency's license or Certificate                            of Authority.

                  b.       Immediately if either party gives detailed written                            notice to the other of alleged gross and willful                            misconduct, fraud or material misrepresentation.

         2.       This Agreement shall terminate, subject to any automatic                   renewal or extension for one year as required by law, upon                   either party giving at least one hundred twenty (120) days                   advance written notice to the other, if not otherwise contrary                   to applicable law or this Agreement.

         3.       If the Agency is delinquent in either accounting or payment of





                  monies due MICOA, MICOA may by written notice to the Agency                   immediately terminate, suspend or modify any of the provisions                   of this agreement. Such action shall not be taken by MICOA                   over minor differences between the records of the Agency and                   MICOA.

         4.       All supplies, including forms and policies furnished by MICOA                   and any copies or other reproductions of them, shall remain                   the property of MICOA and shall be returned to MICOA or its                   representative upon demand.

G.       INDEMNIFICATION

         The respective parties shall indemnify and hold one another harmless as          follows:

         1.       MICOA shall indemnify and hold Agency harmless against any                   MICOA act or omission, except to the extent the Agency has                   caused, compounded, or contributed to such error.

         2.       Agency shall indemnify and hold Agency harmless against any                   act or omission of the Agency, except to the extent MICOA has                   caused, compounded, or contributed to such error.

         3.       The Agency and MICOA shall properly notify one another upon                   receiving notice of the commencement of any action related to                   such liabilities. MICOA shall be entitled to participate in                   any such action or in consultation with Agency and its carrier                   to assume the defense of any such action. If MICOA assumes the                   defense of any such action, it shall not be liable to the                   Agency for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred                   on the Agency's behalf absent MICOA's advance approval of such                   expenses.

         4.       Neither party shall, except at its own risk and expense,                   voluntarily assume any liability, make any payment or incur                   any expense without the prior written consent of the other.

H.       POTENTIAL OPPORTUNITIES

         1.       Other Programs. Agency and MICOA agree that Agency may be                   offered the opportunity to support MICOA's workers'                   compensation, and its other nonphysician professional                   liability or product programs in Nevada when MICOA proceeds                   with related marketing plans. Such plans may also include                   Agency's involvement in sales of MICOA commercial and personal                   products. Appropriate agreements must be negotiated separately                   from this agreement for each such product, and for each such                   territory, including but not limited to Nevada.

         2.       Territory. Agency and MICOA further agree to consider, subject                   to successful negotiation of appropriate agreements separate                   from this agreement, expansion of Agencies' sales territories                   for MICOA beyond Nevada.

There are other agreements between MICOA and                   the Agency's parent corporation, SC&W, which are not                   superceded.

                  a.       There shall be three arbitrators; one shall be                            selected by the Agency, one shall be selected by                            MICOA, and a third shall be selected by those two                            arbitrators. If the two arbitrators cannot agree on                            the selection of a third, American Arbitration                            Association's regional office closest to Agency's                            main office shall be requested to appoint the third                            arbitrator.

                                      -6-

                  d.       The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with                            the procedures of the above referenced regional                            office of the American Arbitration Association.

                  e.       Either Party, may where permitted by the law of                            Nevada, enter judgment upon the arbitrators' award.

         10.      Year 2000 Compliance. Agency must at times assure that any of                   its computers, data processing systems, software components,                   and network arrangements use for MICOA business completely and                   accurately, present, produce, store and calculate all dates                   after December 31, 1999; and that they will not produce                   abnormally ending or incorrect results involving such dates as                   used in any forward or regression data based functions. All                   such items must yield date-related functionalities and date                   fields which accurately indicate the century and millennium                   and correctly perform all calculations involving a four digit                   year field.

RE:      NEVADA DEPARTMENT          PROJECT MEMORANDUM

Dear Terry:

In response to MICOA's request to develop a complete insurance distribution system for Nevada, including physicians professional liability and personal and commercial insurance by July 1999, Stratton, Cheeseman & Walsh, Inc. (SC&W) has spent and will continue to spend a substantial amount of time and money. In recognition that these expenditures will directly benefit MICOA, SC&W and MICOA agree to the following:

-    During the first two years of developing the Nevada distribution system, a      portion of the start up costs will be shared. Subject to compliance with a      detailed budget developed by SC&W and MICOA, these reimbursable costs shall      include:

     -    Salaries and benefits for SCW-Nevada, Inc. employees and agents.

     -    20% of your total personal benefits and salary, and 100% of your           personal travel expenses incurred with respect to the Nevada office,           which respective percentages are intended to recognize your personal           support of MICOA's Nevada initiative.

     -    Legal expenses directly attributable to the Nevada initiative.

     -    Nevada office set up.

     -    Consultant's expenses paid by SC&W in direct support of the           initiative.

     -    The above costs are to be designated and itemized in the preapproved           budget and reimbursed by MICOA at 100% for the first full year of           development and 50% for the second year. It is agreed that the first           year began effective October 1, 1997.

-    All other costs attributable to the normal operation of the Nevada      insurance agency site are the sole responsibility of SC&W.

-    After the first two years (i.e. after October 1, 1999) all expenses will      be borne by SC&W and those amounts paid to SC&W during the first two years      shall be repaid. Repayment shall be through reduction of commissions due      SC&W by 0.5% or if

                                      -7-

     SC&W exceeds $10.0 million in premium revenues by offset in the event any      money is owed the Agency by MICOA. Such reduction or offset shall occur for      so long as necessary to repay amounts reimbursed by MICOA during the      two-year period of development; but in no event will repayment be collected      for a period of greater than ten years. Any unpaid amounts at the end of      ten years shall be forgiven by MICOA.

-    Nevada rent expenses will be shared on a 50/50 basis between MICOA and      SC&W.

-    In order to allow SC&W to expand the distribution system in Nevada with      select and controlled subagents, an exclusive agency agreement will be      negotiated which will spell out the terms and conditions of the      relationship. A commission rate of 12% will be paid for both new and      renewal physicians liability business. Other commission rates will be      determined as products become available. This Agency Agreement should be      finalized by April 30, 1999.

-    MICOA may pay future payments advanced pursuant to this letter on a monthly      basis, unless doing so would be impractical, in which case another periodic      form of&bbsp;payment will be arranged. Amounts owed for past time periods will      be paid as follows: one-third by March 25, 1999; one-third by May 1, 1999;      and one-third by June 1, 1999. All other amounts owed under this Project      Memorandum to be paid by October 1, 1999.

SC&W's responsibilities, under this Project Memorandum, will include assisting MICOA with market assessment, distribution, and sales integration into Nevada. SC&W agrees not to serve in a strategic marketing capacity for another insurer





in Nevada while it is providing such services for MICOA or for a period of one year thereafter.

Terry, please countersign and return this letter to indicate your acceptance.

Sincerely,

MUTUAL INSURANCE CORPORATION OF AMERICA
