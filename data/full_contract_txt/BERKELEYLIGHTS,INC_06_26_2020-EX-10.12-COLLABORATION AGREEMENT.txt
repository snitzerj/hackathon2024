As used in this Section 6.2.1 (Restrictions on BLI), "control" has the meaning set forth in Section 1.2 ("Affiliate" definition). For clarity, [***].

6.2.2 No Further Restrictions by Ginkgo. During the Term, Ginkgo shall not [***] prohibit (i.e. by [***]), as part of any [***] arrangement with a Third Party, a Third Party from purchasing a Beacon Platform or other BLI products or services, or otherwise using or utilizing such Beacon Platforms for [***], including [***].

7.1 Upfront Payment. No later than [***] ([***]) days following the Effective Date, Ginkgo will pay to BLI a non-refundable upfront amount equal to Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000) (the "Upfront Payment").

[***].

7.2 Purchase Commitments.

7.2.1 Generally. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, during the Term, the Parties' target is for Ginkgo to make a total of One Hundred Fifty Million Dollars ($150,000,000) in Development Purchases and Production Purchases from BLI (as amended from time to time under this Agreement and as more fully set forth in this Section 7.2 (Purchase Commitments), the "Full Purchase Target"), which Full Purchase Target is divided into Contract Year purchase commitment targets with respect to Development Purchase Commitment and Production Purchase Targets, as more fully set forth in Section 7.2.2 (Contract Year Purchase Targets and Commitments).

7.2.2 Contract Year Purchase Targets and Commitments. Subject to the terms of this Agreement (including the remainder of this Section 7.2.2 (Contract Year Purchase Targets and Commitments)), for each Contract Year, Ginkgo shall [***] make Development Purchases and Production Purchases from BLI in the amounts set forth in the Page 36 of 85

(a) Minimum Cumulative Purchase Commitments. With respect to each Contract Year, by no later than [***], Ginkgo shall have incurred (including all credits and offsets permitted under this Agreement) at least, in the aggregate since the beginning of the Term, the Minimum Cumulative Purchase Commitment amount for such Contract Year. The Minimum Cumulative Purchase Commitments for each of Contract Years [***] are binding commitments. Any amounts paid by Ginkgo to BLI in excess of the Minimum Cumulative Purchase Commitment amount for a given Contract Year in Contract Years [***], regardless of whether such excess constitutes a Development Purchase or Production Purchase, will be creditable towards the Minimum Cumulative Purchase Commitment in subsequent Contract Year(s) until such excess amount has been fully credited. Ginkgo covenants to pay the Minimum Cumulative Purchase Commitments for each Contract Year by the [***] Business Day after the end of the [***]. If BLI has Substantially Completed at least [***] ([***]) [***] Workflows within the first [***] ([***]) Contract Years, then the Minimum Cumulative Purchase Commitment as of the Contract Year (which may include a portion of a full Contract Year) that is the last Contract Year during the Term pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall change from $109 million (as currently reflected in Table 7.2.2) to $150 million.

(b) Development Purchase Commitments.

(i) Subject to Section 7.2.2(a) (Minimum Cumulative Purchase Commitments), unless the Parties otherwise mutually agree in writing, the Development Purchase Commitment for the [***] Contract Years shall constitute a binding obligation on Ginkgo, and, subject to Ginkgo exercising its Buy-Down Option pursuant to Section 7.3 (Buy-Down Election), the Development Purchase Commitment for the [***] Contract Years shall also constitute binding obligations on Ginkgo. No less than [***] percent ([***]%) of the Development Purchases made in the [***] Contract Years will be used by the Parties to develop Workflows for [***]. Page 37 of 85





(ii) At any time during a Contract Year, upon written notice to the JRC, Ginkgo may accelerate its Development Purchases in such Contract Year to include Development Purchases anticipated to be made in upcoming Contract Year(s). Such additional Development Purchases in excess of the Development Purchase Commitment for such Contract Year will be creditable towards Ginkgo's Development Purchases in subsequent Contract Year(s) until such excess amount has been exhausted and will count towards the Minimum Cumulative Purchase Commitment for the Contract Year in which it is paid, subject to allocation to subsequent Contract Year(s) as set forth in Section 7.2.2(a) (Minimum Cumulative Purchase Commitments).

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event that Ginkgo's Development Purchases in a given Contract Year after [***] are less than the Development Purchase Commitment for such Contract Year, respectively, Ginkgo shall be able to apply the Development Purchases made in the first [***] of the next Contract Year to satisfy the previous Contract Year's Development Purchase Commitment; provided that (i) Ginkgo may only be able to satisfy [***] percent ([***]%) of the relevant Development Purchase Commitment for the previous Contract Year pursuant to this Section 7.2.2(b)(iii) (Development Purchase Commitments) and (ii) any amount of Development Purchases credited towards satisfying the previous Contract Year's Development Purchase Commitment shall not count towards satisfying such targets for the then-current Contract Year.

(iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event that a Workflow Development Plan is terminated prior to completion by the JRC, including (A) [***], (B) [***], (C) [***] or (D) [***], then, subject to Section 3.5.1 (Decision-Making), the JRC shall, in good faith, discuss and approve [***]; provided, however, that such [***] (Term).

(c) Production Purchase Commitments.

(i) Subject to this Section 6.2.2(c) (Production Purchase Commitments), unless the Parties otherwise mutually agree in writing, the Production Purchase Target for the [***] shall constitute a binding obligation on Ginkgo and, in partial satisfaction of its Production Purchase commitment for the Page 38 of 85





[***], Ginkgo shall purchase [***] ([***]) [***] within [***] ([***]) days of the Effective Date, the cost of which, for clarity, shall be offset by the upfront payment paid by Ginkgo pursuant to Section 7.1 (Upfront Payment). Subject to Ginkgo's obligation to satisfy the Minimum Cumulative Purchase Commitment for a Contract Year, with respect to the second [***] Contract Years), Ginkgo's Production Purchase Targets for the [***] Contract Years as set forth in Table 7.2.2 are [***], and the Parties expressly acknowledge and agree that [***].

(ii) At any time during a Contract Year, upon written notice to the JRC, Ginkgo may accelerate its Production Purchases in such Contract Year to include Production Purchases anticipated to be made in upcoming Contract Year(s). Such additional Production Purchases in excess of the Production Purchase Target for such Contract Year will be creditable towards Ginkgo's Production Purchases in subsequent Contract Year(s) until such excess amount has been exhausted and will count towards the Minimum Cumulative Purchase Commitment.

(d) Effects of Tolling. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Ginkgo's obligations to satisfy Development Purchase Commitments and Production Purchase Commitments at all times during the Term (including any Intended End of Term) are subject to Section 5.4.3(d) (Tolling) and this Section 7.2.2(d) (Effects of Tolling). In the event that, at any time during the Term, there is a Failure to Supply, then the duration of this Agreement will automatically be extended for additional calendar months (rounded to the nearest whole calendar month) equal to [***] (the seventh (7t h) anniversary of the Effective Date plus such additional calendar months, the "Intended End of Term").

7.3 Buy-Down Election. During the Term following the end of the second (2nd) Contract Year, Ginkgo may elect, upon written notice to BLI, to buy- down its remaining financial obligations under the Full Purchase Target (the "Buy-Down Election") by making a one-time payment to BLI in the amount of the Buy-Down Amount. In the event Ginkgo notifies BLI of its Buy-Down Election as set forth in this Section 7.3 (Buy-Down Election), then, upon Ginkgo's payment of the Buy-Down Amount to BLI within [***] ([***]) days of Ginkgo's Buy-Down Election, this Agreement shall automatically terminate, with the applicable effects of termination set forth in Section 13.3.2 (Effects of Termination Based Upon Ginkgo's Buy-Down Election).

7.4 Additional Payments.

7.4.1 License Fees. During the Term, and in consideration for the rights granted herein, Ginkgo shall pay field of use license fees ("FOU License Fees") as follows: (a) with respect to any calendar year, no FOU License Fees will be due until [***] and (b) [***] ($[***]) per calendar year per Beacon Optofluidic Machine [***] up to a Page 39 of 85





maximum of [***] ($[***]) per calendar year per Beacon Optofluidic Machine; provided that, in no event will the FOU License Fees paid by Ginkgo for use of a Beacon Optofluidic Machine [***]. FOU License Fees shall be applied to Ginkgo's use of all Beacon Optofluidic Machines, [***]. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement and without limiting any of Ginkgo's rights and remedies under Applicable Law and this Agreement, [***],

7.4.2 Milestone Payments. In the event that Ginkgo uses any of the BLI Proprietary Workflows identified in Exhibit D to conduct Commercial Services for a Third Party customer and such Commercial Services [***] result in the discovery of an Antibody to be used as the active ingredient in a therapeutic product for which a Third Party [***] (each such Antibody subject to this Section 7.4.2 (Milestone Payments), a "Discovered Antibody"), then, on a Discovered Antibody-by-Discovered Antibody basis, in the event such Third Party (a) achieves any of the milestone events noted below in Table 7.4.2 (each, a "Milestone Event") with respect to a Discovered Antibody and (b) makes a payment to Ginkgo in connection with such Milestone Event, then Ginkgo will pay BLI [***] percent ([***]%) of such payment received by Ginkgo from such Third Party up to the amount of the corresponding "Maximum Milestone Payment" for such milestone event set forth below in Table 7.4.2 (each, a "Milestone Payment". Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event shall a Discovered Antibody include (x) an Antibody [***] (e.g. [***]) through the conduct of Commercial Services by Ginkgo or (y) an Antibody [***]. Table 7.4.2

Milestone Event

Maximum Milestone Payment [***] $ [***] [***] $ [***] [***] $ [***] [***] $ [***]

Each Milestone Payment shall be payable only once for each and every Discovered Antibody. If any Milestone Event is achieved for any Discovered Antibody before any of the preceding Milestone Events are achieved for such Discovered Antibody, then all the Milestone Payments for such unachieved preceding Milestone Events will be due and payable with the Milestone Payment for the Milestone Event that was achieved. For example, [***].

7.5 Manner of Payments. Each payment under this Agreement to a Party will be made in Dollars and by electronic transfer in immediately available funds via either a bank wire transfer, an ACH (automated clearing house) mechanism, or any other means of electronic funds transfer, at such receiving Party's election, to such bank account as the receiving Party will designate in writing to the other Party at least [***] ([***]) Business Days before the payment is due.

7.6 Taxes. It is understood and agreed between the Parties that any payments made by a Party to the other Party under this Agreement are exclusive of any sales tax, value added tax (if any) or similar tax ("VAT") upon such payments. Where VAT is properly added to a payment made under this Agreement, the Party making the payment will pay the amount of VAT only on Page 40 of 85





receipt of a valid tax invoice issued in accordance with the laws and regulations of the country in which the VAT is chargeable. If a Party is required to deduct or withhold from any payment due hereunder any taxes in the nature of a tax upon or measured by income, then the Parties shall work together to ensure, subject to this Section 7.6 (Taxes), that the withholding Party is able to comply with its obligations under Applicable Law and that the non- withholding Party still receives the net amount due to it following payment of such tax by the withholding Party. [***]. The Parties will reasonably cooperate to provide sufficient documentation to receive any credits available under Applicable Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that, due to (a) [***], (b) [***], (c) [***], (d) [***] or (e) [***], with respect to each, VAT or other taxes are imposed on payments made by Ginkgo or BLI, as applicable, to the other Party that were not otherwise applicable ("Incremental Withholding Taxes"), the Party that took such action resulting in Incremental Withholding Taxes (together with any subsequent successor or assign, "Responsible Tax Party") shall be solely responsible for and shall solely bear the amount of such Incremental Withholding Taxes. If the other Party receives a refund or tax credit in connection with the Incremental Withholding Taxes, then such other Party shall promptly pay the Responsible Tax Party an amount equal to the amount of such refund or tax credit.

7.7 Financial and Other Records. Each Party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, keep complete and accurate books and records pertaining to its activities conducted and costs incurred under this Agreement (including each approved Workflow Development Plan), including with respect to Budget spending, Development Purchases, Production Purchases, FOU License Fees and Milestone Payments, in sufficient detail to calculate all amounts payable hereunder and to verify compliance with its obligations under this Agreement. Such books and records shall be retained by such Party and its Affiliates until [***] ([***]) years after the end of the period to which such books and records pertain or for such longer period as may be required by Applicable Law.

7.8 Audits. At the request of the other Party, each Party will, and will cause its Affiliates to, permit an independent public accounting firm of nationally recognized standing designated by the other Party and reasonably acceptable to the audited Party, at reasonable times during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, to audit the books and records maintained pursuant to Section 7.7 (Financial and Other Records) solely to confirm the accuracy of all financial reports, invoices and payments made hereunder or Budget spending under an approved Workflow Development Plan. Such examinations may not (a) be conducted more than once in any [***] month period (unless a previous audit during such [***] month period revealed an overpayment (or an underpayment of a Milestone Payment, FOU License Fees, or royalty for Licensed Products) of at least [***] percent ([***]%) of the amount actually due with respect to such period) or (b) [***]. The accounting firm will execute a reasonable written confidentiality agreement with the audited Party and will disclose to the auditing Party only such information as is reasonably necessary to provide the auditing Party with information regarding any actual or potential discrepancies between the amounts actually paid and the amounts payable under this Agreement. The accounting firm's report will [***] be delivered to each Party at the same time and will be deemed final [***] ([***]) business days after it is received by both Parties. The auditing Party shall bear the full cost of any such audit, unless the accounting firm's report discloses an overpayment (or underpayment) by the auditing Party of more than [***] percent ([***]%) of the amount due for any Calendar Quarter, in which case the audited Party shall bear the full cost of such audit. The audited Party shall pay the amount of any overpayment (or underpayment) disclosed in the accounting firm's report, together with interest thereon from the date such payment was originally due, within [***] ([***]) days after delivery to the Parties of the accounting firm's report. Page 41 of 85





7.9 Confidentiality. All books and records audited by a Party pursuant to Section 7.8 (Audits) will be maintained in confidence by such auditing Party in accordance with Article 10 (Confidentiality).

7.10 Late Payment. If any payment due is not paid by the due date, BLI may (a) charge interest on any outstanding amount of such payment, accruing as of the original due date, at an annual rate equal to the rate of prime (as reported in The Wall Street Journal, Eastern U.S. Edition) plus [***] percentage points or the maximum rate allowable by Applicable Law, whichever is less. 8.

CONFIDENTIALITY

10.1 Confidential Information. Each Party may disclose ("Disclosing Party") to the other Party ("Receiving Party"), and Receiving Party may acquire during the course and conduct of activities under the Agreement, certain non-public or confidential information of Disclosing Party in connection with this Agreement. The term "Confidential Information" means all non-public or confidential information or material in tangible form that one Party discloses to the other Party hereunder, or proprietary or confidential information disclosed in non-tangible form that a Disclosing Party identifies to the Receiving Party as confidential information or that, from the nature of such information, the Receiving Party should reasonably know is the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, including all technical and non-technical information conveyed from one Party to the other or otherwise accessed or observed by a Party in any form, electronic data and other proprietary information, data, samples, products, materials, compounds, sequences, compositions, configurations, methods, formulas, formulations, processes, protocols, specifications, designs, recordings, drawings, sketches, models, technologies, equipment, information relating to quality assurance or control, laboratory notebooks, techniques, inventions, Page 48 of 85





know-how, apparatuses, formulae, customer lists, pricing information, strategies, business or marketing plans and other information related to the Disclosing Party's current, future and proposed products, business, customers, Software or technology. The Parties agree that the terms of this Agreement will be treated as Confidential Information of each Party. Without limitation of the foregoing, (i) Ginkgo Background IP, Ginkgo Inventions, Collaboration Data, Specific Implementations, and Ginkgo Workflows will be treated as the Confidential Information of Ginkgo and (ii) BLI Background IP, BLI Inventions, Generalized Workflows and BLI Proprietary Workflows will be treated as the Confidential Information of BLI. Notwithstanding any other provisions herein, Confidential Information does not include information that:

10.1.1 was known to Receiving Party or any of its Affiliates prior to the time of disclosure other than under an obligation of confidentiality with respect to such information;

10.1.2 is at the time of disclosure hereunder or later becomes public knowledge through no fault or omission of Receiving Party or any of its Affiliates;

10.1.5 Receiving Party obtains written consent from Disclosing Party to disclose.

Specific aspects or details of Confidential Information will not be deemed to be within the public domain or in the possession of Receiving Party merely because the Confidential Information is embraced by more general information in the public domain or in the possession of Receiving Party. Further, any combination of Confidential Information will not be considered in the public domain or in the possession of Receiving Party merely because individual elements of such Confidential Information are in the public domain or in the possession of Receiving Party unless the combination and its principles are in the public domain or in the possession of Receiving Party.

10.2 Confidential Treatment. At all times during the Term and for a period of [***] ([***]) years following the end of the Term, or with respect to trade secrets (with such trade secrets either (i) having been specifically identified in writing to the Receiving Party by the Disclosing Party claiming ownership of the same or (ii) reasonably distinguishable by its nature or content as a trade secret of the Disclosing Party), until such time that such information is no longer a trade secret (including pursuant to Sections 10.1.1 - 10.1.5), Receiving Party will, and will cause its Affiliates and its and their respective officers, directors, employees, Permitted Subcontractors, permitted sublicensees and agents to, keep confidential and not publish or otherwise disclose to a Third Party and not use for any purpose, any Confidential Information furnished or otherwise made known to it by the Disclosing Party, except to the extent such disclosure or use is expressly Page 49 of 85





permitted by the terms of this Agreement or is reasonably necessary for the performance of, or the exercise of such Party's rights under, this Agreement; provided that such parties to which the Confidential Information is disclosed are bound by written obligations of confidentiality at least as stringent as those set forth in this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Receiving Party will remain liable for any breach of this Article 10 (Confidentiality) by any party to whom the Receiving Party has disclosed the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information under this Section 10.2 (Confidential Treatment).

10.3 Permitted Disclosures. Receiving Party may disclose the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party in the following instances:

The restrictions imposed by this Section 10.4 (Use of Name) will not prohibit either Party from making any disclosure identifying the other Party that, in the reasonable opinion of the disclosing Party's counsel, is required by Applicable Law; provided that such Party will submit the proposed disclosure identifying the other Party in writing to the other Party as far in advance as reasonably practicable (and in no event less than [***] ([***]) Business Days prior to the anticipated date of disclosure) so as to provide a reasonable opportunity to comment thereon.

12.2 Indemnification by Ginkgo. Ginkgo will indemnify, defend and hold BLI and its Affiliates, and its and their officers, directors, employees, Permitted Subcontractors and agents (each, an "BLI Indemnitee") harmless from and against any and all Claims and Losses, to the extent caused by or arising as a result of (a) the breach by Ginkgo of this Agreement or material inaccuracy in any representation or warranty made by Ginkgo under this Agreement, (b) the negligence, gross negligence, fraud or willful misconduct by a Ginkgo Indemnitee in connection with this Agreement, (c) [***] and (d) any Claims by Ginkgo's employees, Permitted Subcontractors or agents for worker's compensation or other liability coverage, insurance, benefits, and other employee-related claims, and (e) the development, manufacture, use, handling, storage, importation, distribution, sale or other commercialization of Ginkgo Inventions by Ginkgo Page 55 of 85

at the expiration of the Intended End of Term, Ginkgo has paid the Minimum Cumulative Purchase Commitment, but will not have paid to BLI the Full Purchase Target, then the Term of this Agreement shall automatically extend for an additional [***] ([***]) year period from the date of the expiration of the then-Intended End of Term so that, among other things, BLI may potentially receive the benefit of the Full Purchase Target and Ginkgo may receive the continuing benefit of royalty-free licenses.

13.1.2 Effects of Expiration. Upon Expiration of this Agreement: (i) the licenses granted to BLI from Ginkgo pursuant to Section 9.2 (Grants to BLI) and the licenses granted to Ginkgo from BLI in Section 9.1.1 (Scope of Grants) and 9.1.2 (License Grant to Exploit [***]) shall survive and become perpetual, irrevocable, and royalty-free, (ii) no royalties shall be payable by Ginkgo on the sale or transfer of a Licensed Product, (iii) the pricing terms for Beacon Optofluidic Machines, Consumables, and services (including Services) set forth in Section 5.2.2 (Pricing - Adjustments) shall [***], (iv) the restrictions on BLI set forth in Section 6.2.1 (Restrictions on BLI) shall survive to the extent set forth therein and (v) [***].

13.2 Termination With Cause.

13.2.1 Material Breach. If either Party commits a material breach of any of its obligations under this Agreement, then the other Party may give the breaching Party written notice of such material breach. If the breaching Party fails to cure such breach within sixty (60) days after such notice, then the non-breaching Party may terminate this Agreement upon written notice to the breaching Party in its entirety. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the breaching Party has a bona fide dispute as to whether such breach has occurred or has been cured, it will so notify the non- breaching Party in writing and the cure period will be tolled until such dispute is resolved pursuant to Section 14.5.2 (Dispute Resolution).

13.3.5 Effects of Termination Based Upon Ginkgo's Election to Terminate based on a BLI Extended Force Majeure Event.

In order for Ginkgo to more fully understand the royalty that may be owed to BLI in the event this Agreement is terminated, on an annual basis, starting at the end of the [***] Contract Year, BLI will provide Ginkgo, in writing, its then-current commercial terms with respect to royalties for the Licensed Products.

13.4 Rights in Lieu of Termination for BLI's Material Breach of Supply Obligations.

Following any notice by Ginkgo to BLI under this Section 13.4 (Rights in Lieu of Termination for BLI's Material Breach of Supply Obligations), the Parties shall (i) discuss and implement in good faith a plan to address the supply breach by BLI and shall discuss in good faith potential approaches to prevent such breach from reoccurring, including a Page 60 of 85





modification to Ginkgo's forecasts and BLI's obligation to meet a certain percentage of such forecasts and (ii) discuss and implement reductions to the Minimum Cumulative Purchase Commitment for the current and future Contract Years, as well as reductions to the Full Purchase Target, which reductions will be made based on [***].

In the event the Parties disagree as to whether a Collaboration Workflow or Ginkgo Workflow has been developed and used by Ginkgo to good effect prior to termination pursuant to Section 13.3.2 (Effects of Termination Based Upon Ginkgo's Buy-Down Election) or Section 13.3.5 (Effects of Termination Based upon Ginkgo's Election to Terminate based on a BLI Extended Force Majeure Event), with respect to each, at either Party's request, the dispute shall be resolved in an accelerated manner by an Expert Panel subject to the process and cost allocation set forth in Section 3.5.3.

14.5 Governing Law; Dispute Resolution; Equitable Remedies.

14.5.1 Governing Law. This Agreement will be construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to any choice of law provision.

14.5.2 Dispute Resolution. Except with respect to those disputes in which a Party seeks equitable relief pursuant to Section 14.5.3 (Equitable Remedies) or for which a Party or Person is expressly given final decision-making authority as set forth in Section 3.5 (Decision-Making), the Parties, through their Senior Officers, will make a good faith effort to settle any disputes that may arise between them with respect to this Agreement. If the Parties do not settle the matter within [***] ([***]) days after the delivery by one Party of written notice (the "Arbitration Notice") to the other Party involved, then the Parties will submit the matter to binding arbitration in Wilmington, Delaware. All matters so submitted to arbitration will be settled by three (3) arbitrators in accordance with the [***], or its successor (the "[***] Rules"). In the event of a conflict between [***] Rules and this Agreement, this Agreement shall govern. Each Party will designate an arbitrator and the Parties will cause the designated arbitrators to mutually agree upon and to designate a third arbitrator who will serve as chairperson; provided, however, that failing such agreement within [***] ([***]) days of delivery of the Arbitration Notice, the third (3rd) arbitrator will be appointed in accordance with [***] Rules within an additional [***] ([***]) days. The Parties shall arrange for a hearing to occur and be completed within [***] ([***]) days after the appointment of the third (3rd) arbitrator, which hearing shall last no longer than [***], unless the arbitral panel believes a longer period is required, in which case the hearing may last [***]. The Parties will cause the arbitrators to decide the matter to be arbitrated within [***] ([***]) days after the close of evidence unless the chairperson arbitrator determines, at the request of any Party or on his or her own initiative, that such time period should be extended, in which case such time period may not be extended beyond an additional [***] ([***]) day period. Each of Ginkgo and BLI will be permitted to serve one set of document production requests with no more than [***] ([***]) requests; no more than [***] ([***]) interrogatories, including subparts, no more than [***] ([***]) requests for admissions; no more than [***] ([***]) subpoenas to Third Parties; and no more than [***] ([***]) notices of deposition per side, in each case, unless the arbitral panel directs otherwise. Any documents not in English that are produced by a Party will be accompanied by a translation into English, which translation will not be binding upon the other Party or the arbitrators. Each Party covenants and agrees that (a) it will produce documents as required by this Section 14.5.2 (Dispute Resolution), and (b) it will make its employees, and will use commercially reasonable efforts to make its former employees, available for depositions and hearing testimony as requested by the other Party. The final decision of the majority of the arbitrators shall be in writing, in all events follow governing law and will be furnished to all the Parties in such dispute. Judgment on such decision may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Such decision may be used in a court of law only for the purpose of seeking enforcement of the arbitrators' award. Except as required by Applicable Law or to enforce an arbitrators' award, neither Party may disclose the existence, contents or results of an arbitration brought in accordance with this Agreement, or the evidence produced by its opposing Parties, or any analysis or summaries derived from such evidence. The Parties agree that all applicable statutes of limitation and Page 64 of 85





time-based defenses (such as estoppel and laches) will be tolled while the procedures set forth in this Section 14.5.2 (Dispute Resolution) are pending. The Parties will cooperate in taking any actions necessary to achieve this result. Except as may be determined by the arbitrators, neither Party shall be penalized for delays resulting from dispute resolution conducted pursuant to this Section 14.5.2 (Dispute Resolution).

14.5.3 Equitable Remedies; Single Forum. Notwithstanding any other terms of this Agreement, either Party may seek a preliminary injunction or other provisional equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction as permitted by Applicable Law. At all times while any claim, action, suit or other proceeding between the Parties and/or any of their Affiliates (or among the Parties and/or any of their Affiliates and one or more Third Parties) arising out of or relating to this Agreement is pending in any court of competent jurisdiction, no dispute that is justiciable and can be joined to such pending claim, action, suit or other proceeding shall be submitted to arbitration pursuant to Section 14.5.2 (Dispute Resolution) without both Parties' mutual consent and, instead, either Party may join such dispute to the pending claim, action, suit or other proceeding by including such dispute in its pleadings or amending its pleadings. In the event that a motion to amend is required to achieve such joinder, the non- moving Party shall consent to such motion.

14.6 Entire Agreement; Amendment and Waiver. This Agreement, together with the Exhibits and Schedules attached hereto, sets forth and constitutes the entire agreement and understanding between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and all prior agreements, understandings, promises and representations, whether written or oral, with respect thereto are superseded hereby. This Agreement may not be amended except by a writing signed by authorized representatives of both Parties. The failure of a Party at any time or times to require performance of any provision hereof will in no manner affect its rights at a later time to enforce the same. To be valid, a waiver must be in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the Party having the right that is waived or to whom the obligation to be waived is owed.

14.7 English Language. This Agreement will be written and executed in, and all other communications under or in connection with this Agreement will be in, the English language. Any translation into any other language will not be an official version thereof, and in the event of any conflict in interpretation between the English version and such translation, the English version will control.

14.8 Force Majeure. Any delay in the performance of any of the duties or obligations (other than payment obligations) of either Party hereto caused by a Force Majeure Event (defined below) shall not be considered a breach of this Agreement and the time required for performance shall be extended for a period equal to the period of such delay. "Force Majeure Event" shall mean acts of God, acts of the public enemy, war, terrorism, insurrections, riots, injunctions, embargoes, fires, explosions, floods, or other unforeseeable causes beyond the reasonable control and without the fault or negligence of the Party who is so prevented or delayed from fulfilling its obligations under this Agreement by such Force Majeure Event (the "Affected Party"). The Affected Party shall give prompt written notice to the other Party of such cause and shall take whatever reasonable steps are appropriate in the other Party's discretion to relieve the effect of such cause as rapidly as possible. The Party not directly affected by the Force Majeure Event shall have the right to terminate this Agreement with written notice effective upon receipt if Force Page 65 of 85





Majeure Event continues to prevent performance or compliance in any material respect by the other Party for a period of more than [***] ([***]) days or should [***] ([***]) Force Majeure Events apply to the performance of such other Party during any [***] (each a "Extended Force Majeure Event").

14.9 Further Assurances. Each Party will duly execute and deliver, or cause to be duly executed and delivered, such further instruments and do and cause to be done such further acts and things, including the filing of such assignments, agreements, documents, and instruments, as may be necessary or as the other Party may reasonably request in connection with this Agreement or to carry out more effectively the provisions and purposes hereof, or to better assure and confirm unto such other Party its rights and remedies under this Agreement.

14.10 Third Party Beneficiaries. There are no Third Party beneficiaries under this Agreement, except to the extent a Third Party is indemnified pursuant to Article 12 (Indemnification; Insurance); provided that, in no event will any Third Party entitled to indemnification pursuant to Article 12 (Indemnification; Insurance) be allowed to enforce the terms thereof against a Party.

14.11 Export Control. This Agreement is made subject to any restrictions concerning the export of products or technical information from the United States or other countries which may be imposed upon the Parties from time to time. Each Party agrees that it will not export, directly or indirectly, any technical information acquired from the other Party under this Agreement or any products using such technical information to a location or in a manner that at the time of export requires an export license or other governmental approval, without first obtaining the applicable license, approval, or written consent to do so from the appropriate agency or other governmental entity.

14.12 References. Unless otherwise specified, (a) references in this Agreement to any Article, Section, Exhibit or Schedule will mean references to such Article, Section, Exhibit or Schedule of this Agreement, (b) references in any Section to any clause are references to such clause of such Section and (c) references to any agreement, instrument or other document in this Agreement refer to such agreement, instrument or other document as originally executed or, if subsequently amended, replaced or supplemented from time to time, as so amended, replaced or supplemented and in effect at the relevant time of reference thereto.

14.13 Attachments. In the event of any inconsistencies between this Agreement and any Exhibits, Schedules or other attachments hereto, the terms of this Agreement will control, unless the relevant Exhibit, Schedule or other attachment explicitly references its inconsistency with this Agreement and states that it shall control.

14.14 Non-Solicit. Neither Party will, [***], directly or indirectly with or through any Person, solicit for employment any Person who is an employee of the other Party; provided, however, that general solicitation of the public for employment shall not constitute a solicitation hereunder so long as such general solicitation is not designed to target any such Person. In the event that a Party solicits and then hires an employee of the other Party in violation of this Section 14.4 (Non-Solicit), the hiring Party shall, [***], within [***] ([***]) days of such hire, pay the other Party an amount equal to the [***] cash compensation actually paid to the individual Page 66 of 85





([***]) by the non-hiring Party in the immediately prior calendar year and, further, if the individual solicited and then hired in violation of this is a Key Person under Section 5.4.1(b) (Dedicated FTEs; Key Persons), then BLI shall have [***] ([***]) months to identify an employee as the individual to replace such Key Person and any (a) [***] or (b) [***], in each case (a)-(b), to the extent due to the absence of such Key Person performing a Workflow Development Plan upon which the Key Person was engaged, shall be deemed waived for that [***] month period.
