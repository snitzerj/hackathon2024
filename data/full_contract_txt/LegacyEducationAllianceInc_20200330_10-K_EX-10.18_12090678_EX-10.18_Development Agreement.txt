None of the provisions contained in this Agreement nor any acts of the parties hereto shall be deemed to create any relationship between the parties other than the relationship specified in this Agreement. 14.7 Severability. In the event any provision of this Agreement or the application of any provision shall be held by a tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, then, the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall be unimpaired, and the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision shall be replaced by a provision, which, being legal, valid and enforceable, comes closest to the intent of the parties underlying the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision. In any event, an illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision shall not affect the enforceability or the validity of the remaining terms or portions thereof, and each such unenforceable or invalid provision or portion thereof shall be severable from the remainder of this Agreement. 14.8 Cost of Enforcement. If a party commences any action at law or in equity, or for declaratory relief to secure or protect any rights under, or to enforce any provision of, this Agreement, then, in addition to any judgment, order, or other relief obtained in such proceedings, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover from the losing party all reasonable costs, expenses, and attorneys' fees incurred by the party in connection with such proceedings, including, attorneys' fees incurred for consultation and other legal services performed prior to the filing of such proceeding.
