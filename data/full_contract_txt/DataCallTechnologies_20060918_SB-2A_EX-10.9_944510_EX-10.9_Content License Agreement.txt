     2.3  LICENSOR  grants  plan_b  for  the  term  of  this Agreement the right           to  produce,  market  and  distribute  Content  to  End  Users (in the           territory  specified  in appendix 2) through its own and its partner's           platform.

The Initial Term shall automatically be           extended  for  an additional period of half a year unless either party           provides  the  other party with written notification of termination of           the  letter  Agreement  at  least 60 days prior to end of such period.

     7.2  Either  Party  shall  be  entitled  to  cancel  this  Agreement if the           other Party is materially in breach of the terms of this Agreement. If           the  breach  of  contract is capable of being remedied, this Agreement           can  be  cancelled  only  provided  that  the  Party in breach has not           rectified  its breach within thirty (30) days of the written notice by           the  other  Party.

     7.3  Either  Party  may  cancel  this  Agreement  already prior to the date           of  its  fulfillment,  if it becomes evident that the other Party will           commit  a  breach  of  contract  entitling  to  cancellation  of  this           Agreement.

     7.4  Upon termination  or  cancellation  of  this  Agreement  plan_b  shall           cease to use Content for any purpose and delete Content from any files           and  data  storage.

8    MISCELLANEOUS

     8.1  The Parties  acknowledge  that  they  act  as  independent contractors           and this Agreement does not constitute any partnership, joint venture,           agency  relationship  or  other independent legal entity separate from           the  Parties.

     8.2  Neither  Party  shall  assign  or  transfer  to  any  third  party,           without  the  prior written consent of the other Party, this Agreement           or  any  rights  granted  herein.

     8.3  Any amendments  to  this  Agreement  shall  be  in  writing  and shall           have no effect before signed by the duly authorized representatives of           the  Parties.

9    SEVERABILITY

     9.1  In the  event  that  any  provision  in this Agreement will be subject           to  an  interpretation  under which it would be void or unenforceable,           such  provisions  will be construed so as to constitute it a valid and           enforceable provision to the fullest extent possible, and in the event           that  it  cannot  be  so construed, it will, to that extent, be deemed           deleted  and  separable  from  the other provisions of this Agreement,           which  will  remain  in full force and effect and will be construed to           effectuate  its  purposes  to  the  maximum  legal  extent.

     10.1 This Agreement  shall  be  governed  and  construed in accordance with           the  laws  of  the  United  States of America.
