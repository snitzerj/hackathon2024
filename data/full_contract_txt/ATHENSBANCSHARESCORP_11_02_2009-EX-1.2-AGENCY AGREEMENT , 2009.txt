Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.  Investment Banking  10 South Wacker Drive, Suite 3400  Chicago, Illinois 60606

Ladies and Gentlemen:

Athens Bancshares Corporation, a Tennessee corporation (the "Company"), and Athens Federal Community Bank, a federal savings bank located  in Athens, Tennessee (the "Bank") (references to the "Bank" include the Bank in mutual or stock form as indicated by the context), the deposit  accounts of which are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"), hereby confirm their agreement with Keefe, Bruyette &  Woods, Inc. (the "Agent") as follows:

Section 1. The Offering. The Bank, in accordance with its plan of conversion adopted by its Board of Directors (the "Plan"), intends to convert  from a federally-chartered mutual savings bank to a federal stock savings bank (the "Conversion"), and issue all of its issued and outstanding  capital stock to the Company. The Conversion will be accomplished pursuant to federal law and the rules and regulations of the Office of Thrift  Supervision (the "OTS"). Pursuant to the Plan, the Company will offer and sell up to shares (subject to increase up to shares) of its common stock,  $.01 par value per share (the "Shares" or "Common Shares"), in a subscription offering (the "Subscription Offering") to (1) depositors of the Bank  with Qualifying Deposits (as defined in the Plan) as of March 31, 2008 ("Eligible Account Holders"), (2) the employee stock ownership plan  established by either the Bank or the Company (the "ESOP"), (3) depositors of the Bank with Qualifying Deposits as of September 30, 2009  ("Supplemental Eligible Account Holders"), and (4) other depositor and borrower members of the Bank as defined in the Plan. Subject to the prior  subscription rights of the above-listed parties, the Company may offer for sale in a community offering (the "Community Offering" and when  referred to together with or subsequent to the Subscription Offering, the "Subscription and Community Offering") the Shares not subscribed for or  ordered in the Subscription Offering to members of the general public to whom a copy of the Prospectus (as hereinafter defined) is delivered with a  preference given first to natural persons who are residents of Blount, Bradley, Hamilton, Knox, Loudon, McMinn, Meras, Monroe and Polk  Counties in Tennessee. It is anticipated that shares not subscribed for in the Subscription and Community Offering may be offered to certain  members of the general public on a best efforts basis through a selected dealers agreement (the "Syndicated Community Offering") (the  Subscription Offering, Community Offering and Syndicated Community Offering are collectively referred to as the "Offering"). It is acknowledged  that the purchase of Shares in the Offering is subject to the maximum and minimum purchase limitations as described in the Plan and that the  Company may reject, in whole or in part, any orders received in the Community Offering or Syndicated Community Offering.

In connection with the Conversion and pursuant to the terms of the Plan as described in the Prospectus, immediately following the consummation  of the Conversion, subject to the approval of the Bank's depositors and compliance with certain conditions as may be imposed by regulatory  authorities, the Company will contribute $100,000 and 100,000 shares of Common Stock to the Athens Federal Foundation (the "Foundation") such  shares hereinafter being referred to as the ("Foundation Shares").







The Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-   )  (the "Registration Statement"), containing a prospectus relating to the Offering, for the registration of the Shares under the Securities Act of 1933  (the "1933 Act"), and has filed such amendments thereof and such amended prospectuses as may have been required to the date hereof. The term  "Registration Statement" shall include any documents incorporated by reference therein and all financial schedules and exhibits thereto, as  amended, including post-effective amendments. The prospectus, as amended, on file with the Commission at the time the Registration Statement  initially became effective is hereinafter called the "Prospectus," except that if any Prospectus is filed by the Company pursuant to Rule 424(b) or (c)  of the rules and regulations of the Commission under the 1933 Act (the "1933 Act Regulations") differing from the prospectus on file at the time  the Registration Statement initially became effective, the term "Prospectus" shall refer to the prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) or (c) from  and after the time said prospectus is filed with the Commission.

In accordance with Title 12, Part 563b of the Code of Federal Regulations (the "Conversion Regulations"), the Bank has filed with the OTS an  Application For Conversion on Form AC (the "Form AC"), including the Prospectus and the Conversion Valuation Appraisal Report prepared by  Keller & Company, Inc. (the "Appraisal") and has filed such amendments thereto as may have been required by the OTS. The Form AC has been  approved by the OTS and the related Prospectus has been authorized for use by the OTS. In addition, the Company has filed with the OTS its  Application H-(e)l-S (the "Holding Company Application") to become a savings and loan holding company under the Home Owners' Loan Act, as  amended ("HOLA") and the regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Control Act Regulations").

Section 2. Retention and Compensation of Agent. Subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, the Company and the Bank hereby appoint  the Agent as their exclusive financial advisor and marketing agent (i) to utilize its best efforts to solicit subscriptions for Common Shares and to  advise and assist the Company and the Bank with respect to the Company's sale of the Shares in the Offering and (ii) to participate in the Offering  in the areas of market making and in syndicate formation (if necessary).

On the basis of the representations, warranties, and agreements herein contained, but subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, the  Agent accepts such appointment and agrees to consult with and advise the Company and the Bank as to the matters set forth in the letter  agreement, dated June 9, 2009, between the Bank and the Agent (a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit A) (the "Engagement Letter"). It is  acknowledged by the Company and the Bank that the Agent shall not be required to purchase any Shares or be obligated to take any action which  is inconsistent with all applicable laws, regulations, decisions or orders.

The obligations of the Agent pursuant to this Agreement shall terminate upon termination of the Offering, but in no event later than 45 days after  the completion of the Subscription Offering (the "End Date"). All fees or expenses due to the Agent but unpaid will be payable to the Agent in  next day funds at the earlier of the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined) or the End Date. In the event the Offering is extended beyond the End  Date, the Company and the Agent may agree to renew this Agreement under mutually acceptable terms.

In the event the Company is unable to sell a minimum of    Shares within the period herein provided, this Agreement shall terminate and the  Company shall refund to any persons who have subscribed for any of the Shares the full amount which it may have received from them plus  accrued interest, as set forth in the Prospectus; and none of the parties to this Agreement shall have any obligation to the other parties hereunder,  except as set forth in this Section 2 and in Sections 7, 9 and 10 hereof. In the event the Offering is terminated for any reason not attributable to the  action or inaction of the Agent, the Agent shall be paid the fees due to the date of such termination pursuant to subparagraphs (a) and (d) below.

2







The Agent shall receive the following compensation for its services hereunder:

(a) A management fee of $30,000 payable in four consecutive monthly installments of $7,500 each commencing with the execution of the  Engagement Letter. This fee shall be deemed to have been earned when due and shall be non-refundable.

(b) A success fee upon completion of the Offering of 1.125% of the aggregate purchase price of the Common Shares sold in the Subscription  Offering and Community Offering excluding shares purchased by the Bank's officers, directors, or employees (or members of their immediate  family), any ESOP, tax-qualified or stock-based compensation plans (except IRAs) or similar plan created by the Bank or the Company for some or  all of its directors or employees, or contributed to any charitable foundation established by the Bank in connection with the Conversion. In no  event shall the success fee paid for the sale of Common Stock in the Subscription and Community Offering be less than $200,000. The management  fee will be applied against the first success fee.

(c) If any of the Common Shares remain available after the Subscription Offering, at the request of the Company, the Agent will seek to form a  syndicate of registered broker-dealers ("Selected Dealers") to assist in the sale of such Common Shares on a best efforts basis, subject to the  terms and conditions set forth in the selected dealers agreement. The Agent will endeavor to distribute the Common Shares among the Selected  Dealers in a fashion which best meets the distribution objectives of the Bank and the Plan. The Agent will be paid a fee not to exceed 5.5% of the  aggregate Purchase Price of the Shares sold in the Syndicated Community Offering. The Agent will pass onto the Selected Dealers who assist in  the Syndicated Community Offering an amount competitive with gross underwriting discounts charged at such time for comparable amounts of  stock sold at a comparable price per share in a similar market environment. Fees with respect to purchases effected with the assistance of Selected  Dealers other than the Agent shall be transmitted by the Agent to such Selected Dealers. The decision to utilize Selected Dealers will be made by  the Company upon consultation with the Agent.

(d) The Company and the Bank shall reimburse the Agent for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including costs of travel, meals and lodging,  photocopying, telephone, facsimile and couriers. The Company and the Bank will reimburse the Agent for the fees and expenses of the Agent's  counsel which will not exceed $50,000. The Company will bear the expenses of the Offering customarily borne by issuers including, without  limitation, regulatory filing fees, SEC, "Blue Sky," and FINRA filing and registration fees; the fees of the Company's accountants, attorneys,  appraiser, transfer agent and registrar, printing, mailing and marketing and syndicate expenses associated with the conversion; and the fees set  forth under this Section 2; and any fees for Blue Sky legal work.

Full payment of the Agent's actual and accountable expenses, advisory fees and compensation shall be made in next day funds on the earlier of  the Closing Date or a determination by the Bank to terminate or abandon the Offering. The payment of such expenses assume no unusual  circumstances or delays, or a re-solicitation in connection with the subscription and community offering. The Company and the Bank acknowledge  that such expense cap may be increased by mutual consent, including in the event of a material delay in the Offering which would require an  update of the financial information in tabular form to reflect a period later than that set forth in the original filing.

Section 3. Sale and Delivery of Shares. If all conditions precedent to the consummation of the Conversion, including without limitation, the sale of  all Shares required by the Plan to be sold, are satisfied, the Company agrees to issue, or have issued, the Shares sold in the Offering and to release  for delivery certificates for such Shares on the Closing Date against payment to the Company by any means authorized by the Plan; provided,  however, that no funds shall be released to the Company until the conditions specified in Section 8 hereof shall have been complied with to the  reasonable satisfaction of the Agent and its counsel. The release of Shares against payment therefor shall be made on a date and at a place  acceptable to the Company, the Bank and the Agent. Certificates for shares shall be delivered

3







directly to the purchasers in accordance with their directions. The date upon which the Company shall release or deliver the shares sold in the  Offering, in accordance with the terms herein, is called the "Closing Date."

14







material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances prevailing at the subsequent time, not misleading, the  Company has notified or will notify promptly the Agent so that any use of such Issuer-Represented Free Writing Prospectus may cease until it is  amended or supplemented and the Company has promptly amended or will promptly amend or supplement such Issuer-Represented Free Writing  Prospectus to eliminate or correct such conflict, untrue statement or omission; provided, however, that this covenant shall not apply to any  statements or omissions made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by the Agent expressly for  use therein.

(f) The Company and the Bank will use their best efforts to cause any post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement to be declared  effective by the Commission and any post-effective amendment to the Form AC or the Holding Company Application to be approved by the OTS  and will immediately upon receipt of any information concerning the events listed below notify the Agent: (i) when the Registration Statement, as  amended, has become effective; (ii) when the Form AC or the Holding Company Application, as amended, has been approved by the OTS; (iii) of  any comments from the Commission, the OTS or any other governmental entity with respect to the Conversion contemplated by this Agreement;  (iv) of the request by the Commission, the OTS or any other governmental entity for any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement,  the Form AC, Holding Company Application or for additional information; (v) of the issuance by the Commission, the OTS or any other  governmental entity of any order or other action suspending the Conversion or the use of the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or any  other filing of the Company or the Bank under the Conversion Regulations, or other applicable law, or the threat of any such action; (vi) of the  issuance by the Commission, the OTS or any authority of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or of the  initiation or threat of initiation or threat of any proceedings for that purpose; or (vii) of the occurrence of any event mentioned in paragraph (h)  below.

(i) The Company and the Bank will comply with any and all material terms, conditions, requirements and provisions with respect to the Offering  imposed by the Commission, the OTS or the Conversion Regulations, and by the 1933 Act, the 1933 Act Regulations, the 1934 Act and the 1934  Act Regulations to be complied with prior to or subsequent to the Closing Date and when the Prospectus is required to be delivered, and during  such time period the Company and the Bank will comply, at their own expense, with all material requirements imposed upon them by the  Commission, the OTS or the Conversion Regulations, and by the 1933 Act, the 1933 Act Regulations, the 1934 Act and the 1934 Act Regulations,  including, without limitation, Rule 10b-5 under the 1934 Act, in each case as from time to time in force, so far as necessary to permit the  continuance of sales or dealing in the Common Shares during such period in accordance with the provisions hereof and the Prospectus.

For the purpose of this Agreement, the Company will timely furnish to the Agent such information with respect to itself and the Bank as the Agent  may from time to time reasonably request.

(k) The Company and the Bank will take all necessary actions in cooperating with the Agent and furnish to whomever the Agent may direct such  information as may be required to qualify or register the Shares for offering and sale by it or to exempt such Shares from registration, or to exempt  the Company as a broker-dealer and its officers, directors and employees as broker-dealers or agents under the applicable securities or blue sky  laws of such jurisdictions in which the Shares are required under the Conversion Regulations to be sold or as the Agent and the Company may  reasonably agree upon; provided, however, that the Company shall not be obligated to file any general consent to service of

16

In each jurisdiction where any of the Shares shall have been qualified or registered as above provided, the  Company will make and file such statements and reports in each fiscal period as are or may be required by the laws of such jurisdiction.

(l) The liquidation account for the benefit of Eligible Account Holders and Supplemental Eligible Account Holders will be duly established and  maintained in accordance with the requirements of the Conversion Regulations, and such Eligible Account Holders and Supplemental Eligible  Account Holders who continue to maintain their savings accounts in the Bank will have an inchoate interest in their pro rata portion of the  liquidation account, which shall have a priority superior to that of the holders of the Common Stock in the event of a complete liquidation of the  Bank.

(m) The Company and the Bank will not sell or issue, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of, for a period of 90 days after the Closing Date, without  the Agent's prior written consent, any of their shares of their common stock, other than the Common Shares or other than in connection with any  plan or arrangement described in the Prospectus.

(n) The Company will register its common stock under Section 12(b) of the 1934 Act. The Company shall maintain the effectiveness of such  registration for not less than three years from the time of effectiveness or such shorter period as may be required by the OTS.

(h) Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, the Agent shall receive a letter from Hazlett, Lewis & Bieter, PLLC, dated as of the date  hereof and addressed to the Agent: (i) confirming that Hazlett, Lewis & Bieter, PLLC is a firm of independent registered public accountants within  the applicable rules of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and stating in effect that in its opinion the consolidated  financial statements and related notes of the Company as of December 31, 2008, and for each of the years in the three-year period ended December  31, 2008, and covered by their opinion included therein, and any other more recent unaudited financial statements included in the Prospectus  comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements and related published rules and regulations of the OTS and  the 1933 Act; (ii) stating in effect that, on the basis of certain agreed upon procedures (but not an audit in accordance with standards of the Public  Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)) consisting of a reading of the latest available consolidated financial statements of the  Company prepared by the Company, a reading of the minutes of the meetings of the Board of Directors, Executive Committee and Audit Committee  of the Company and the Bank and consultations with officers of the Company and the Bank responsible for financial and accounting matters,  nothing came to their attention which caused them to believe that:

(A) audited consolidated financial statements and any unaudited interim financial statements included in the Prospectus are not in conformity with  the 1933 Act, applicable accounting requirements of the OTS and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applied  on a basis substantially consistent with that of the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Prospectus; or

(B) during the period from the date of the latest financial statements included in the Prospectus to a specified date not more than three business  days prior to the date of the Prospectus, except as has been described in the Prospectus, there was any increase in borrowings of the Company,  other than normal deposit fluctuations for the Bank; or (C) there was any decrease in the net assets of the Company

26







at the date of such letter as compared with amounts shown in the latest balance sheet included in the Prospectus; and (iii) stating that, in addition  to the audit referred to in their opinion included in the Prospectus and the performance of the procedures referred to in clause (ii) of this  subsection (h), they have compared with the general accounting records of the Company, which are subject to the internal controls of the  Company, the accounting system and other data prepared by the Company, directly from such accounting records, to the extent specified in such  letter, such amounts and/or percentages set forth in the Prospectus as the Agent may reasonably request; and they have found such amounts and  percentages to be in agreement therewith (subject to rounding).

(i) At the Closing Date, the Agent shall receive a letter dated the Closing Date, addressed to the Agent, confirming the statements made by Hazlett,  Lewis & Bieter, PLLC in the letter delivered by it pursuant to subsection (g) of this Section 8, the "specified date" referred to in clause (i) of  subsection (h) to be a date specified in the letter required by this subsection (h) which for purposes of such letter shall not be more than three  business days prior to the Closing Date.

(j) At the Closing Date, the Company shall receive a letter from Keller & Company, Inc., dated the Closing Date (i) confirming that said firm is  independent of the Company and the Bank and is experienced and expert in the area of corporate appraisals within the meaning of Title 12 of the  Code of Federal Regulations, Section 563b.200(b), (ii) stating in effect that the Appraisal prepared by such firm complies in all material respects  with the applicable requirements of Title 12 of the Code of Federal Regulations, and (iii) further stating that its opinion of the aggregate pro forma  market value of the Company including the Bank, as most recently updated, remains in effect.

(k) At or prior to the Closing Date, the Agent shall receive: (i) a copy of the letters from the OTS approving the Form AC, the Holding Company  Application and authorizing the use of the Prospectus and the establishment of the Foundation, including the issuance of shares thereto; (ii) a  copy of the orders from the Commission declaring the Registration Statement and the Exchange Act Registration Statement effective; (iii) a  certificate from the OTS evidencing the valid existence of the Company and the Bank; (iv) a certificate from the FDIC evidencing the Bank's  insurance of accounts; (v) a certificate from the FHLB-Cincinnati evidencing the Bank's membership therein; and (vi) a certified copy of the Bank's  Charter and Bylaws.

(l) Subsequent to the date hereof, there shall not have occurred any of the following; (i) a suspension or limitation in trading in securities generally  on the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") or in the over-the-counter market, or quotations halted generally on The Nasdaq Stock Market, or  minimum or maximum prices for trading have been fixed, or maximum ranges for prices for securities have been required by either of such  exchanges or the Nasdaq Stock Market or by order of the Commission or any other governmental authority; (ii) a general moratorium on the  operations of commercial banks, or federal savings and loan associations or a general moratorium on the withdrawal of deposits from commercial  banks or federal savings and loan associations declared by federal or state authorities; (iii) the engagement by the United States in hostilities  which have resulted in the declaration, on or after the date hereof, of a national emergency or war; or (iv) a material decline in the price of equity or  debt securities if the effect of such a declaration or decline, in the Agent's reasonable judgment, makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed  with the Offering or the delivery of the Shares on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus.

(m) At or prior to the Closing Date, counsel to the Agent shall have been furnished with such documents and opinions as they may reasonably  require for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon the sale of the Shares as herein contemplated and related proceedings or in order to  evidence the occurrence or completeness of any of the representations or warranties, or the fulfillment of any of the conditions, herein contained;  and all proceedings taken by the Company and the Bank in connection with the sale of the Shares as herein contemplated shall be satisfactory in  form and substance to the Agent and its counsel.

27







(n) All such opinions, certificates, letters and documents will be in compliance with the provisions hereof only if they are reasonably satisfactory  in form and substance to the Agent and to counsel for the Agent. Any certificate signed by an officer of the Company or the Bank and delivered  to the Agent or to counsel for the Agent shall be deemed a representation and warranty by the Company or the Bank, as the case may be, to the  Agent as to the statements made therein.

Section 9. Indemnification.

(a) The Company and the Bank jointly and severally agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Agent, its officers and directors, employees and  agents, and each person, if any, who controls the Agent within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20(a) of the 1934 Act, against  any and all loss, liability, claim, damage or expense whatsoever (including, but not limited to, settlement expenses), joint or several, that the Agent  or any of them may suffer or to which the Agent and any such persons may become subject under all applicable federal or state laws or otherwise,  and to promptly reimburse the Agent and any such persons upon written demand for any expense (including all fees and disbursements of  counsel) incurred by the Agent or any of them in connection with investigating, preparing or defending any actions, proceedings or claims  (whether commenced or threatened) to the extent such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions: (i) arise out of or are based upon any untrue  statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the  General Disclosure Package, any Issuer-Represented Limited-Use Free Writing Prospectus, preliminary or final Prospectus (or any amendment or  supplement thereto), the Form AC (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the Holding Company Application (or any amendment or  supplement thereto) or any instrument or document executed by the Company or the Bank or based upon written information supplied by the  Company filed in any state or jurisdiction to register or qualify any or all of the Shares or to claim an exemption therefrom or provided to any state  or jurisdiction to exempt the Company or the Bank as a broker-dealer or its officers, directors and employees as broker-dealers or agents, under the  securities laws thereof (collectively, the "Blue Sky Application"), or any document, advertisement, oral statement or communication ("Sales  Information") prepared, made or executed by or on behalf of the Company or the Bank with its consent and based upon written or oral information  furnished by or on behalf of the Company or the Bank, whether or not filed in any jurisdiction, in order to qualify or register the Shares or to claim  an exemption therefrom under the securities laws thereof; (ii) arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state in any of the  foregoing documents or information a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the  circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; or (iii) arise from any theory of liability whatsoever relating to or arising from or based  upon the Registration Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto), preliminary or final Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement  thereto), the General Disclosure Package, any Issuer-Represented Limited-Use Free Writing Prospectus, the Form AC (or any amendment or  supplement thereto) the Holding Company Application (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Blue Sky Application or Sales Information  or other documentation distributed in connection with the Conversion; provided, however, that no indemnification is required under this  paragraph (a) to the extent such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions arise out of or are based upon any untrue material statement or  alleged untrue material statement in, or material omission or alleged material omission from, the Registration Statement (or any amendment or  supplement thereto), preliminary or final Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the General Disclosure Package, any Issuer- Represented Limited-Use Free Writing Prospectus, the Form AC, the Holding Company Application, any Blue Sky Application or Sales  Information made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company, by the Agent or its counsel regarding  the Agent, and provided, that it is agreed and understood that the only information furnished in writing to the Company, by the Agent regarding  the Agent is set forth in the Prospectus under the caption "The Conversion and Stock Offering — Marketing Arrangements"; and, provided  further, that such indemnification shall be limited to the extent prohibited by the Commission, the OTS, the FDIC and the Board of Governors of the  Federal Reserve System.

28







(b) The Agent agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company and the Bank, their directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls  the Company or the Bank within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20(a) of the 1934 Act against any and all loss, liability, claim,  damage or expense whatsoever (including but not limited to settlement expenses), joint or several, which they, or any of them, may suffer or to  which they, or any of them may become subject under all applicable federal and state laws or otherwise, and to promptly reimburse the Company,  the Bank, and any such persons upon written demand for any expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) incurred by  them, or any of them, in connection with investigating, preparing or defending any actions, proceedings or claims (whether commenced or  threatened) to the extent such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions: (i) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged  untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the Form AC (or any  amendment or supplement thereto), the Holding Company Application, the preliminary or final Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement  thereto), any Blue Sky Application or Sales Information, (ii) are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state in any of the foregoing  documents a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which  they were made, not misleading, or (iii) arise from any theory of liability whatsoever relating to or arising from or based upon the Registration  Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto), preliminary or final Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the Form AC (or  any amendment or supplement thereto), the Holding Company Application, or any Blue Sky Application or Sales Information or other  documentation distributed in connection with the Offering; provided, however, that the Agent's obligations under this Section 9(b) shall exist only if and only to the extent that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement was made in, or such material fact or alleged material fact was  omitted from, the Registration Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the preliminary or final Prospectus (or any amendment or  supplement thereto), the Form AC (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the Holding Company Application, any Blue Sky Application or  Sales Information in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company or the Bank, by the Agent or its counsel  regarding the Agent, and provided, that it is agreed and understood that the only information furnished in writing to the Company or the Bank, by  the Agent regarding the Agent is set forth in the Prospectus under the caption "The Conversion and Stock Offering — Marketing Arrangements."

(c) Each indemnified party shall give prompt written notice to each indemnifying party of any action, proceeding, claim (whether commenced or  threatened), or suit instituted against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall  not relieve it from any liability which it may have on account of this Section 9 or otherwise. An indemnifying party may participate at its own  expense in the defense of such action. In addition, if it so elects within a reasonable time after receipt of such notice, an indemnifying party, jointly  with any other indemnifying parties receiving such notice, may assume defense of such action with counsel chosen by it and approved by the  indemnified parties that are defendants in such action, unless such indemnified parties reasonably object to such assumption on the ground that  there may be legal defenses available to them that are different from or in addition to those available to such indemnifying party. If an indemnifying  party assumes the defense of such action, the indemnifying parties shall not be liable for any fees and expenses of counsel for the indemnified  parties incurred thereafter in connection with such action, proceeding or claim, other than reasonable costs of investigation. In no event shall the  indemnifying parties be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (and any special counsel that said firm may  retain) for each indemnified party in connection with any one action, proceeding or claim or separate but similar or related actions, proceedings or  claims in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances.

Section 10. Contribution. In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnification provided for in  Section 9 is due in accordance with its terms but is for any reason held by a court to be unavailable from the Company, the Bank or the Agent, the  Company, the Bank and the Agent shall contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities

29







(including any investigation, legal and other expenses incurred in connection with, and any amount paid in settlement of, any action, suit or  proceeding, but after deducting any contribution received by the Company, the Bank or the Agent from persons other than the other parties  thereto, who may also be liable for contribution) in such proportion so that the Agent is responsible for that portion represented by the percentage  that the fees paid to the Agent pursuant to Section 2 of this Agreement (not including expenses) bears to the gross proceeds received by the  Company from the sale of the Shares in the Offering, and the Company and the Bank shall be responsible for the balance. If, however, the  allocation provided above is not permitted by applicable law, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by  such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative fault of the Company and the Bank on the one hand  and the Agent on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions,  proceedings or claims in respect thereto), but also the relative benefits received by the Company and the Bank on the one hand and the Agent on  the other from the Offering (before deducting expenses). The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the  untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by  the Company and the Bank on the one hand or the Agent on the other and the parties' relative intent, good faith, knowledge, access to information  and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company, the Bank and the Agent agree that it would not be just and  equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 10 were determined by pro-rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not  take into account the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 10. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result  of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions, proceedings or claims in respect thereof) referred to above in this Section 10 shall be  deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any  such action, proceeding or claim. It is expressly agreed that the Agent shall not be liable for any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense or be  required to contribute any amount pursuant to Section 9(b) or this Section 10 which in the aggregate exceeds the amount paid (excluding  reimbursable expenses) to the Agent under this Agreement. It is understood that the above stated limitation on the Agent's liability is essential to  the Agent and that the Agent would not have entered into this Agreement if such limitation had not been agreed to by the parties to this  Agreement. No person found guilty of any fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to  contribution from any person who was not found guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Company, the Bank and the  Agent under this Section 10 and under Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company and the Agent may otherwise have. For  purposes of this Section 10, each of the Agent's, the Company's or the Bank's officers and directors and each person, if any, who controls the  Agent or the Company or the Bank within the meaning of the 1933 Act and the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Agent on  the one hand, or, the Company or the Bank on the other hand. Any party entitled to contribution, promptly after receipt of notice of  commencement of any action, suit, claim or proceeding against such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made against  another party under this Section 10, will notify such party from whom contribution may be sought, but the omission to so notify such party shall  not relieve the party from whom contribution may be sought from any other obligation it may have hereunder or otherwise than under this Section  10.

Section 11. Survival of Agreements, Representations and Indemnities. The respective indemnities of the Company, the Bank and the Agent, the  representations and warranties and other statements of the Company, the Bank and the Agent set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement and  the provisions relating to contribution shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any termination or cancellation of this Agreement or any  investigation made by or on behalf of the Agent, the Company, the Bank or any controlling person referred to in Section 9 hereof, and shall  survive the termination of this Agreement and the issuance of the Shares, and any successor or assign of the Agent, the Company and the Bank,  and any such controlling person shall be entitled to the benefit of the respective agreements, indemnities, warranties and representations.

30







Section 12. Termination. The Agent may terminate this Agreement by giving the notice indicated below in this Section 12 at any time after this  Agreement becomes effective as follows:

(a) If any domestic or international event or act or occurrence has materially disrupted the United States securities markets such as to make it, in  the Agent's reasonable opinion, impracticable to proceed with the offering of the Shares; or if trading on the NYSE shall have suspended (except  that this shall not apply to the imposition of NYSE trading collars imposed on program trading); or if the United States shall have become involved  in a war or major hostilities; or if a general banking moratorium has been declared by a state or federal authority which has a material effect on the  Company on a consolidated basis; or if a moratorium in foreign exchange trading by major international banks or persons has been declared; or if  there shall have been a material adverse change in the financial condition, results of operations or business of the Bank, or if the Bank shall have  sustained a material or substantial loss by fire, flood, accident, hurricane, earthquake, theft, sabotage or other calamity or malicious act, whether or  not said loss shall have been insured; or if there shall have been a material adverse change in the financial condition, results of operations or  business of the Bank.

(b) In the event the Company fails to sell the required minimum number of the Shares by the date when such sales must be completed, in  accordance with the provisions of the Plan or as required by the Conversion Regulations, and applicable law, this Agreement shall terminate upon  refund by the Company to each person who has subscribed for or ordered any of the Shares the full amount which it may have received from such  person, together with interest as provided in the Prospectus, and no party to this Agreement shall have any obligation to the other hereunder,  except as set forth in Sections 2(a) and (d), 7, 9 and 10 hereof.

(c) If any of the conditions specified in Section 8 shall not have been fulfilled when and as required by this Agreement, unless waived in writing, or  by the Closing Date, this Agreement and all of the Agent's obligations hereunder may be cancelled by the Agent by notifying the Company of  such cancellation in writing or by telegram at any time at or prior to the Closing Date, and any such cancellation shall be without liability of any  party to any other party except as otherwise provided in Sections 2(a), 2(d), 7, 9 and 10 hereof.

(d) If the Agent elects to terminate this Agreement as provided in this Section, the Company and the Bank shall be notified promptly by telephone  or telegram, confirmed by letter.

The Company or the Bank may terminate this Agreement in the event the Agent is in material breach of the representations and warranties or  covenants contained in Section 5 and such breach has not been cured after the Company or the Bank has provided the Agent with notice of such  breach.

This Agreement may also be terminated by mutual written consent of the parties hereto.
