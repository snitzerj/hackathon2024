all rights to, itself, through Affiliates and/or through Third Party contractor or Third Party Partner, conduct Clinical Studies (and file all Regulatory Filings required in connection with the such Clinical Studies) with respect to Products in the Ono Territory to the extent permitted under Section 4.5 below.

2.2 Sublicensees and Distributors.

(a)  It is understood and acknowledged that Array's decision to select Ono to commercialize Products in the Ono Territory was based in part on the understanding that Ono currently markets pharmaceutical products in the Ono Territory and that Ono intends to market Products in the same manner. Ono shall have the right, in accordance with this Section 2.2, to grant sublicenses under the Array Patents and Array Know-How to its Affiliates and to Third Parties, provided that Ono shall not engage a Third Party as either (i) a Sublicensee of the Product, or (ii) as a distributor of the Product, without Array's prior written consent. For clarity, a wholesaler shall not be considered a "distributor" for purposes of the foregoing restriction.

(b) Ono shall ensure that each of its Sublicensees and distributors is bound by a written agreement between Ono and such Sublicensee or distributor that does not conflict with, and contains provisions as protective of the Products and Array, as this Agreement. Without limiting any of Ono's obligations under this Agreement, Ono shall also ensure that each Sublicensee expressly agrees in writing to be bound by all of Ono's obligations under this Agreement to the extent applicable to such Sublicensee, including without limitation, the following provisions of this Agreement (as if such Sublicensee were expressly named in each such provision, to the extent Ono's Sublicensees are not so named therein): Sections 2.6 (Grantback License to Array), 4.7 (Exchange of Data and Know-How); 4.8 (Right of Reference and Access to Data); 7.4 (Records), 8.2 (Exclusivity of Efforts) and 14.2 (transition obligations on termination).

(c)  Ono shall in all cases remain responsible for any actions of its Affiliates and Sublicensees exercising rights under a sublicense of the rights granted by Array to Ono under this Agreement to the same extent as if such actions had been taken by Ono itself.

(d)  Promptly following the execution of each Sublicense to a Sublicensee, Ono shall provide Array with an executed copy of such Sublicense which may be redacted as described below (together with a detailed English summary of such sublicense agreement if such Sublicense was originally executed in a language other than English); and Ono shall also provide to Array an executed copy (which may be redacted as described below) of any amendment to a Sublicense that relates to a Product (together with a detailed English summary of such amendment, if such amendment was originally executed in a language other than English), promptly following the execution of each such amendment.

If after the Effective Date, Array or Ono (the "Sublicensing Party") acquire rights from a Third Party that are to be licensed to the other Party under this Agreement, respectively ("Third Party Technology"), but that is subject to royalty or other payment obligations to the Third Party, then the following shall apply: The licenses granted to the other Party (the "Commercializing Party") hereunder with respect to such Third Party Technology shall be subject to the Commercializing Party's agreeing to promptly reimburse and promptly reimbursing the Sublicensing Party for any milestone payments, royalties or other amounts that become owing to such Third Party by reason of the Commercializing Party's exercise of such license or sublicense to the Third Party Technology. To the extent that any such payments made by a Sublicensing Party under an agreement to acquire Third Party Technology are not attributable to either the Array Territory or Ono Territory, but are attributable to the acquisition of rights to a Third Party Technology used for the Product, such payments shall be allocated [ * ] to Array and [ * ] to Ono to the extent that such Third Party Technology has been licensed by the Sublicensing Party on a global basis and is equally applicable to the Products being sold in the Array Territory and the Ono Territory. In all other cases such costs shall be allocated between Array and Ono by the JDRC on a pro rata basis based on the respective value of Third Party Technology in the Array Territory or Ono Territory. At the inception of the inclusion of any Third Party Technology in such license under this Agreement and thereafter upon request by the Commercializing Party, the Sublicensing Party shall disclose to the Commercializing Party a true, complete and correct written description of such payment obligations, and the Commercializing Party's obligation to reimburse such amounts following such request shall be limited to those payment obligations as so disclosed by the Commercializing Party. In the event that the Commercializing Party does not agree to reimburse or does not promptly reimburse the Sublicensing Party for such amounts upon request (such amounts as determined by the JDRC in accordance with this Agreement, to the extent so provided above), then such Third Party Technology shall thereafter be deemed excluded from the licenses or other subject matter licensed hereunder.

(b) Right to Offset. With respect to payments that Ono has agreed to reimburse to Array pursuant to subsection 2.3(a) above, Ono shall be entitled to treat such payments as payments made to Third Parties with respect to Blocking Patents for purposes of Section 6.6 below.

It is further agreed that to the extent that such future Third Party Partner conditions Ono's access to such data, know-how, rights of reference and improvements on payment from Ono, Ono may require that Array conditions such future Third Party Partner's access to Ono's data, know-how, rights of reference and improvements on receipt of similar payment.

2.5 Activities Outside the Respective Territory.

(ii) In the event that the JDRC does not approve the Joint Clinical Study Proposal (or a substantially similar proposal) within sixty (60) days after such Joint Clinical Study Proposal has been submitted to the JDRC, the each Party shall be free to carry out at its own expense the relevant Clinical Study(ies) described in such Joint Clinical Study Proposal independently, subject to the terms of Sections 2.1 and 4.4(c).

(b) Joint Development Plans. Pursuant to Section 4.4(a), the Working Group designated by JDRC shall in good faith discuss and prepare the Joint Development Plan covering Approved Clinical Study(ies) for review by JDRC.

(i) Once Joint Development Plan prepared by the Working Group is approved at JDRC, the Parties shall initiate the Approved Clinical Study(ies) in accordance with the Joint Development Plan.

(ii) In the event that the JDRC is unable to agree upon a Joint Development Plan for such Approved Clinical Study within sixty (60) days after the applicable Joint Study Proposal has been approved by the JDRC, each Party shall be free to carry out such Approved Clinical Study(ies) at its own expense independently upon notice to the other Party, and subject to the terms of Sections 2.1 and 4.4(c).

(iii) The JDRC shall review the Joint Development Plan on an ongoing basis from time-to-time as needed. The JDRC may make adjustments to the then-current Joint Development Plan from time-to-time as it deems appropriate.

(c)  Consequences of Rejection of Joint Clinical Study Proposals or Joint Development Plan.

(i) In case of the rejection of a Joint Clinical Proposal by the JDRC pursuant to Section 4.4(a)(ii) or the inability of the Parties to agree upon a Joint Development Plan for an Approved Clinical Study as described in Section 4.4(b)(ii), each Party may, upon notice to the other Party, conduct the relevant Clinical Study described in the Joint Clinical Study Proposal (hereinafter the "Declined Clinical Study") at its own expense, subject to Section 2.1 above; provided, however, that:

(A) any Declined Clinical Study conducted by Ono (or its Affiliates or Sublicensees) shall be conducted solely within the Ono Territory;

(B) each Party, should it elect to conduct any Declined Clinical Study on its own shall keep the JDRC and the other Party informed as to the design of any such Declined Clinical Study(ies) to be conducted by or under its authority;

(C) any Declined Clinical Study conducted by Array or PFM shall be permitted to include clinical sites within the Ono Territory to the extent consistent with the requirements of Section 4.5;

28











[ * ] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

(D) if the Party that is not conducting a Declined Clinical Study (the "Non-Performing Party") determines reasonably and in good faith that the Declined Clinical Study is reasonably likely to adversely affect the Development or Commercialization of the Products in the Field, then the Party performing such Declined Clinical Study (the "Performing Party") shall not undertake such Declined Clinical Study unless and until the JDRC determines that such Declined Clinical Study should be permitted; and

(E) The Performing Party shall provide formal written reports of the results of the Declined Clinical Study and the costs of such Declined Clinical to the Non-Performing Party when such written reports are available, and the JDRC during meetings of the JDRC, upon request of the other Party but not more than twice a year during the period in which any study within the Declined Clinical Study is being performed. For clarity, Section 18.11 shall apply with respect to Declined Clinical Studies undertaken by either Party in accordance with this Section 4.4(c).

(ii) Costs of Declined Clinical Studies and Use of related Data. The Performing Party shall bear all costs associated with Declined Clinical Studies it undertakes. If Ono (or an Ono Affiliate or Sublicensee) submits to a Regulatory Authority in Ono Territory Data generated by Array (including its Affiliates) or a Third Party Partner pursuant to a Declined Clinical Study (either directly or by reference under Section 4.8 below) for purposes of obtaining new or expanded Marketing Approval for the Product for the same Indication that was the subject of study in such Declined Clinical Study, Ono shall reimburse Array an amount equal to [ * ] of the costs incurred by Array (including by its Affiliates) and/or such Third Party Partner for the Declined Clinical Study. If Array (including its Affiliates) and/or PFM submits to a Regulatory Authority in the Array Territory Data generated by Ono pursuant to a Declined Clinical Study (either directly or by reference under Section 4.8 below) for purposes of obtaining new or expanded Marketing Approval for the Product for the same Indication that was the subject of study in such Declined Clinical Study, Array shall reimburse Ono an amount equal to [ * ] of the costs incurred by Ono (including by its Affiliates) for the Declined Clinical Study. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that Ono is the Non-Performing Party and the PMDA (or MHLW), based on the fact that the Declined Clinical Study utilized clinical sites in Japan, compels Ono to file for a new or expanded Marketing Approval for the Product based on the Data generated by Array pursuant to a Declined Clinical Study, then the foregoing obligation to reimburse Array [ * ] of the costs of the Declined Clinical Study shall be waived.

(d) Except for Investigator Sponsored Clinical Studies included in the Existing Clinical Studies, neither Party shall authorize or support an Investigator Sponsored Clinical Study or any Post-Approval Marketing Clinical Study in the other Party's territory without obtaining prior written consent.

(e) Development Efforts; Manner of Performance; Reports.

Such inspections may be made no more than once each Calendar Year, at reasonable times and on reasonable prior written notice. Such records for any particular calendar quarter shall be subject to no more than one inspection. The Auditor shall be obligated to execute a reasonable confidentiality agreement prior to commencing any such inspection. Inspections conducted under this Section 7.4 shall be at the expense of Array, unless a variation or error producing an underpayment in amounts payable exceeding [ * ] of the amount paid for a period covered by the inspection is established, in which case all reasonable costs relating to the inspection for such period and any unpaid amounts that are discovered shall be paid by Ono, together with interest on such unpaid amounts at the rate set forth in Section 7.1 above. The Parties will endeavor in such inspection to minimize disruption of Ono's normal business activities to the extent reasonably practicable.

The filing, prosecution and enforcement of Joint Patents is described in Section 11.2(b) below. With respect to the filing, prosecution and enforcement of all other Patents directed to inventions made jointly by personnel of Array (or that of any Affiliate) and Ono (or that of any Affiliate) in connection with this Agreement that are not Joint Inventions relating to Binimetinib and Encorafenib and/or Products, the Parties shall consult with one another and mutually agree upon such actions.

11.2 Prosecution and Maintenance of Array Patents and Joint Patents.

56











[ * ] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

course of such patent filing, prosecution, maintenance or other proceedings with respect to Array Patents. Array shall provide Ono with copies of each draft patent application with respect to Array Patents (in English, unless Japanese translation is available) to be filed as well as copies of each office action received from the relevant patent offices in each country of the Ono Territory, in each case with enough lead time where reasonably practicable, to enable Ono to review and comment on such application or action; provided that Array shall have no obligation to delay any action or response pending receipt of such comments or suggestions. Additionally, Array will provide Ono with copies of the patent applications and responses to office actions it ultimately files with the patent offices in the Ono Territory (in the original language, unless English translation is available). If Array determines not to file within any jurisdiction requested by Ono, not to continue the prosecution of, or not to continue to maintain or defend, any Array Patent in any country in the Ono Territory, or if Array otherwise determines to abandon any such Array Patent, Array shall promptly notify Ono of such determination sufficiently in advance to enable Ono to undertake or continue the prosecution, maintenance or defense of such Array Patent without a loss of rights, and Ono shall have the right to undertake or continue such prosecution, maintenance or defense at its sole cost and expense. Ono shall hold all information disclosed to it under this Section 11.2 as confidential.

(b)  Prosecution of Joint Patents. Prior to preparation and filing of any Joint Patent, the Parties shall consult with one another and mutually agree upon a lead Party to file, prosecute and maintain such Joint Patent under the names of both Array and Ono. The Joint Patents shall be prepared and prosecuted by a mutually acceptable patent law firm and allocation of costs for preparation, filing, prosecution and maintenance shall be agreed by the Parties prior to preparation and filing of such Joint Patent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may elect not to support the filing, prosecution and maintenance of all or part of any Joint Patent in any country in the world.

If such Party declines to pursue such patent term extensions, then the other Party shall have the right on behalf of such Party to file all such applications and take all such actions necessary to obtain such patent term extensions (or similar additional or supplemental protection) with respect to the Product. In each case, the Parties shall fully cooperate to obtain such extensions and additional protection.

11.3 Enforcement.

(a)  Enforcement Actions.

(i) In the event that Array or Ono becomes aware of actual or threatened infringement or misappropriation of any Array Patent or Array Know-How in any country within the Ono Territory by the Manufacture or sale or use of an unauthorized version of a Product ("Infringing Product"), then such Party shall promptly notify the other Party in writing and the Parties shall consult with each other with respect to the strategy in response to such Infringing Product. Array shall have the first right, but not the obligation, to initiate proceedings or take other appropriate action in Ono Territory, at its own expense, against any such Third Party. If Array does not initiate proceedings or take other appropriate action within ninety (90) days of receipt of a request by Ono to initiate an enforcement proceeding, or if a legal proceeding must be commenced prior to the end of such ninety(90) day period to avoid a loss of rights, then no later than five (5) days prior to such deadline, then Ono shall be entitled to initiate infringement proceedings or take other appropriate action against an Infringing Product at its own expense. The Party conducting such action ("Enforcing Party") shall have full control over its conduct, including settlement thereof; provided, however, that the Enforcing Party may not settle any such action, or make any admissions or assert any position in such action, in a manner that would materially adversely affect the rights or interests of the other Party, without the prior written consent of the other Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. In any event, the Parties shall assist one another and cooperate in any such litigation at Enforcing Party's reasonable request.

(ii) With respect to Infringing Products containing Binimetinib, Ono's rights under Section 11.3(a)(i) are subject to the rights previously granted to AstraZeneca AB ("AZ") pursuant to Sections 8.3.1 and 8.3.3 of that certain Collaboration and License Agreement between Array and AZ, effective as of December 18, 2003, as amended by that certain Amendment to Collaboration and License Agreement, between Array and AZ, effective as of June 1, 2009 (collectively, the "AZ Agreement"). For the avoidance of doubt, the rights granted to or retained by Array pursuant to Sections 8.3.1 and 8.3.3 of the AZ Agreement shall, to the extent relating to Infringing Products containing Binimetinib, be subject to this Agreement, including this Section 11.3. Any enforcement actions initiated by AZ with respect to an Infringing Product shall be deemed initiated by Array for purposes of Section 11.3(a)(i), and the costs and expenses incurred by Array in such enforcement action shall include any costs and expenses reimbursed or required to be reimbursed by Array to AZ in accordance with the AZ Agreement in such enforcement action. Additionally it is further understood that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the AZ Agreement, and the rights granted to AZ thereunder, shall in no event constitute a breach of Sections 8.2 and 15.1.

(iii) With respect to the responsibility and allocation of costs for the enforcement of the Joint Patents (i) against Third Party products that infringe the Joint Patents outside the Ono Territory, or (ii)

58

against Third Party products in the Ono Territory that infringe the Joint Patents but that are not "Infringing Products", the Parties shall discuss and agree at the time when the Parties consult with respect to the strategy of such enforcement action in response to such Third Party infringement.

(b) Recovery.

(i)  Array and Ono shall recover their respective actual out-of-pocket expenses (including attorneys' fees), or equitable proportions thereof, associated with any litigation against infringers undertaken pursuant to Section 11.3(a) (i) or (ii) above or settlement thereof from any resulting recovery made by either Party. Any excess amount of such a recovery shall be allocated as follows: (i) if Ono initiated such litigation, [ * ] of such excess amount shall be retained by Ono and [ * ] by Array, and (ii) if Array initiated such litigation, Array shall retain [ * ] of such excess amount and Ono shall obtain [ * ] of such excess amount, to the extent such excess amount represents damages relating to Manufacture or sale or use of an Infringing Product in the Ono Territory.

(ii) With respect to enforcement actions against infringers relating to Joint Patents undertaken pursuant to 11.3(a)(iii) above, the Parties shall discuss and agree in good faith at the time when the Parties consult with respect to the strategy of such enforcement action in response to such Third Party infringement.

(c)  Cooperation. The Parties shall keep one another informed of the status of their respective activities regarding any litigation or settlement thereof concerning the Array Patents or the Array Know-How within the Ono Territory, and shall assist one another and cooperate in any such litigation at the other's reasonable request (including joining as a party plaintiff to the extent necessary and requested by the other Party).

11.4 Third Party Infringement Claims.

(a) If the production, sale or use of any Product in the Ono Territory pursuant to this Agreement results in a claim, suit or proceeding alleging patent infringement against Array and/or Ono (or their respective Affiliates, licensees or Sublicensees) (collectively, "Infringement Actions"), the Party subject to such claim, suit or proceeding ("Subject Party") shall promptly notify the other Party hereto in writing and shall discuss with the other Party the strategy for defending such Infringement Actions but shall have the right to direct and control the defense thereof in its sole discretion and at its own expense, with counsel of its choice; provided, however, the other Party may participate in the defense and/or settlement thereof, at its own expense with counsel of its choice.

or the Manufacture, use or sale of such Product in any country of the world, without the prior written consent of Array; and Array agrees not to settle such Infringement Action, or make any admissions or assert any position in such Infringement Action, in a manner that would adversely affect the allegedly infringing Product, or the Manufacture, use or sale of such Product, within the Ono Territory, without the prior written consent of Ono, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

If the use of "mektovi" is not advisable for legal, regulatory or other material reasons outside the Parties' reasonable control, in one or more countries of the Ono Territory, Ono shall utilize "balimek" as such Product Trademark is such country or countries. If neither "mektovi" not "balimek" can be used (or if it is not advisable to use them) for legal, regulatory or other material reasons outside the Parties' reasonable control, in one or more countries of the Ono Territory, Ono may select an alternative Product Trademark reasonably acceptable to Array for use in such country or countries, with any disputes being referred to the JCC for resolution, it being understood that in resolving any such dispute the JCC shall give preference to the creation of a single brand for Products containing Binimetinib in countries where neither "balimek" or "mektovi" can be used.

(ii) Products Containing Encorafenib. Where possible, Ono shall utilize "braftovi" as the Product Trademark for Products containing Encorafenib. If the use of "braftovi" is not advisable for legal, regulatory or other material reasons outside the Parties' reasonable control, in one or more countries of the Ono Territory, Ono may select an alternative Product Trademark reasonably acceptable to Array for use in such country or countries, with any disputes being referred to the JCC for resolution, it being understood that in resolving any such dispute the JCC shall give preference to the creation of a single brand for Products containing Encorafenib in countries where "braftovi" cannot be used.

(b) Each Product shall be sold in the Ono Territory under the trade name Ono or other trade name chosen by Ono and the logo of Ono; provided, however that to the extent permissible under applicable Law within the Ono Territory, such packaging materials, labels and Marketing Materials shall also display the trade name of Array in reasonable size and prominence,

12.2 Assignment. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, following registration of the Product Trademark(s) by Array in the Ono Territory pursuant to Section 12.3 below, Array shall assign, and shall cause its Affiliates to assign, to Ono all rights to the Product Trademark(s) so registered in the Ono Territory at Ono's cost and expense, in each case solely for the purpose of Commercializing the Products in the Ono Territory in accordance with this Agreement. Ono shall be responsible for maintenance of such Product Trademark(s) at its cost and expense in the Ono Territory.

If, however, neither balimek nor mektovi is available or desirable in a given country or countries, Ono agrees to file and register, at Ono's expense and name, appropriate registrations for an alternative Product Trademark (selected in accordance with Section 12.1(a)(i)) in such country or countries of the Ono Territory. As between the Parties, Ono shall have the sole right to file at its expense and in its own name, appropriate registrations for the trade dress utilized with the Product in the Ono Territory.

If the Product Trademark for Products containing Encorafenib is braftovi, Array (or its designee) shall use Diligent Efforts to file and register at Array's expense and in its own name (to the extent permitted by applicable Law), appropriate registrations for such Product Trademarks in the Ono Territory. If, however, braftovi is not available or desirable in a given country or countries, Ono agrees to file and register, at Ono's expense and name, appropriate registrations for an alternative Product Trademark (selected in accordance with Section 12.1(a)(ii)) in such country or countries of the Ono Territory. As between the Parties, Ono shall have the sole right to file at its expense and in its own name, appropriate registrations for the trade dress utilized with the Product in the Ono Territory.

12.4 Approval of Packaging and Promotional Materials. The Parties agree that the quality of the Products packaging shall be consistent with the highest standards of quality in the pharmaceuticals industry.

(a)  Mektovi/Balimek/Array. Without limiting Section 5.1(c) above, to the extent necessary to preserve Array's legal rights in the balimek or mektovi Product Trademarks,

61







[ * ] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

Ono shall submit representative Marketing Materials, packaging and Product displaying the balimek or mektovi Product Trademarks and/or Array's trade name to Array for Array's review and approval (such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) prior to the first use of such Marketing Materials, packaging or Product and prior to any subsequent change or addition to such Marketing Materials, packaging or Product; provided that if Array has not responded within ten (10) Business Days after the submission of such Marketing Materials, packaging or Product, Array's approval will be deemed to have been received.

(b) Braftovi/Array. Without limiting Section 5.1(c) above, to the extent necessary to preserve Array's legal rights in the braftovi Product Trademark, Ono shall submit representative Marketing Materials, packaging and Product displaying the braftovi Product Trademark and/or Array's trade name to Array for Array's review and approval (such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) prior to the first use of such Marketing Materials, packaging or Product and prior to any subsequent change or addition to such Marketing Materials, packaging or Product; provided that if Array has not responded within ten (10) Business Days after the submission of such Marketing Materials, packaging or Product, Array's approval will be deemed to have been received.

(c)  Other. With respect to all Product Trademarks other than balimek, mektovi or braftovi, Ono shall, and shall cause its respective Affiliates and Sublicensees to, comply with trademark style and usage standards approved by Array from time to time in connection with use of the Product Trademark(s). Ono shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, at its own expense, submit representative Marketing Materials, packaging and Product displaying such Product Trademarks to Array for approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. In the event that Array reasonably objects to a proposed usage of the Product Trademark(s), it shall give written notice of such objection to Ono within sixty (60) days of receipt of such sample, specifying the way in which such usage of its Product Trademark(s) fails to meet the style, usage or quality standards for the Product or Product Trademark set forth in the first two sentences of this Section 12.4(c). If Ono or its Affiliate wishes to use such representative Marketing Materials, it must remedy the failure and submit further samples to Array's for approval.

12.5 Enforcement.

(a)  If either Party becomes aware of any actual or threatened infringement of any Product Trademark in the Ono Territory, such Party shall promptly notify the other Party in writing. Ono shall, at its own expense, initiate infringement proceedings or take other appropriate actions against an infringement of any Product Trademark in the Ono Territory and/or to defend any actions or proceedings involving the Product Trademarks in the Ono Territory, as the case may be. Ono shall have full control over the conduct of such action, including settlement thereof;

62







[ * ] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

provided, however, Ono may not settle any such action, or make any admissions or assert any position in such action, in a manner that would materially adversely affect the Product Trademarks in the Ono Territory nor the rights or interests of Array, without the prior written consent of Array, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. In any event, the Ono shall keep Array informed of the status of its activities regarding any litigation in the Ono Territory involving a Product Trademark or settlement thereof and Array shall assist Ono and cooperate in any such litigation at Ono's reasonable request and expense.

(b) Ono and Array shall recover their respective actual out-of-pocket expenses, or proportionate percentages thereof, associated with any litigation against infringers undertaken pursuant to this Section 12.5 or settlement thereof from any resulting recovery made by either Party. Any excess amount of such a recovery shall be [ * ] between Ono and Array, to the extent such recovery represents damages pertaining to the infringement of a Product Trademark in the Ono Territory.

12.6 Domain Names. Array shall own rights to, and shall be responsible, at its own expense, for registering and maintaining, the Internet domain names listed on Exhibit 12.6 (each of the foregoing, a "Domain Name") and agrees to grant, and hereby grants to Ono a royalty-free, fully paid-up exclusive license to use those particular Domain Names which Ono elects to use (and actually uses) in connection with Ono's commercialization of the Product in the Ono Territory in accordance with this Agreement. In the event Ono would like to use an available Internet domain name including the balimek, mektovi or braftovi, or Product Trademarks not previously registered to Array, Array grants Ono its consent to register and maintain such Internet domain names in Ono's name and at Ono's expense, provided that upon termination (but not expiration) of this Agreement, Ono shall transfer full and exclusive ownership and control of such Internet domain names to Array, or if Array so requests, promptly withdraw registration of such Internet domain name(s), in each case at Ono's sole cost and expense. Each Party shall own rights to any Internet domain names incorporating the Product Trademark(s) owned by such Party under Section 12.1 or any variation or part of such Product Trademark(s) as its URL address or any part of such address, and agrees to grant, and hereby grants to the other Party a royalty-free, fully paid-up exclusive license to use those particular Internet domain names which the grantee Party elects to use (and actually uses) in connection with the grantee Party's commercialization of the applicable Product in the grantee Party's Territory in accordance with this Agreement. The use rights granted to the Internet domain names under this Section 12.6 are limited to the grantee Party's Territory, and neither Party shall actively make or authorize any use, direct or otherwise, of its Internet domain names outside its respective territory. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that the Internet domain names and the goodwill pertaining to such Internet domain names shall belong exclusively to the Party owning such Internet domain name, who shall be registered as "Registrant" or "Owner" and as "Administrative Contact" of the relevant domain name. The Parties agree that any use of a Product Trademark in any content describing or referring to a Product: (i) on any internet page or web site operated by Array in

63







[ * ] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

the Array Territory shall be in the sole control of Array, and (ii) on any internet page or web site operated by Ono in the Ono Territory, subject to the terms of this Agreement, shall be in the sole control of Ono, and therefore Ono and Array, respectively, shall be responsible for any damage caused to the Product Trademarks as a result of their use of the Product Trademarks on any internet page or web site in their respective territories.

ARTICLE XIII

TERM AND TERMINATION

13.1 Term. This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and, unless terminated earlier pursuant to this Article 13, shall continue in full force and effect, on a Product-by-Product and country-by-country basis until the Secondary Royalty Term with respect to such Product expires, at which time this Agreement shall expire in its entirety with respect to such Product in such country. Upon expiration of this Agreement, the licenses granted to Ono under Section 2.1 shall become non-exclusive, fully paid- up, irrevocable, perpetual, royalty free licenses, with sublicensing rights, to Develop, Manufacture, and/or Commercialize the Products in the Ono Territory. From and after the expiration of this Agreement, Ono shall have the exclusive, fully paid up, royalty- free right to use (i) Product Trademarks assigned to Ono under Section 12.2, and (ii) those Domain Names licensed to Ono under Section 12.6, in each case solely for purposes of, and to the extent necessary, for Ono to continue to Commercialize the Products in the Field in the Ono Territory.

13.2 Termination by Ono without Cause. Commencing on the later of (i) [ * ] of the First Commercial Sale of the Binimetinib Product in the Ono Territory, or (ii) [ * ] of the First Commercial Sale of the Encorafenib Product in the Ono Territory, Ono shall have the right to terminate this Agreement, for any reasons by giving [ * ] advance written notice to Array which shall be accompanied by the rationale for such termination.

13.3 Termination for Material Breach. Either Party may terminate this Agreement in its entirety in the event the other Party shall have materially breached or defaulted in the performance of any of its material obligations hereunder, and such default shall have continued for ninety (90) days (or with respect to any breach of any payment obligations, for sixty (60) days) after written notice thereof was provided to the breaching Party by the non‑breaching Party. Any such termination shall become effective at the end of such ninety (90) day period (or sixty (60) day period with respect to any failure to pay) unless the breaching Party has cured any such breach or default prior to the expiration of the applicable cure period. Exercising the right to terminate this Agreement by a Party pursuant to this Section 13.3 shall not preclude a claim or a compensation for damages on the other Party.

13.4 Termination for Bankruptcy. Either Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon written notice to the other Party: (a) if such other Party is declared insolvent or bankrupt by a

64











[ * ] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

court of competent jurisdiction; (b) if a voluntary or involuntary petition in bankruptcy is filed in any court of competent jurisdiction against such other Party and such petition is not dismissed within ninety (90) days after filing; (c) if such other Party shall make or execute an assignment of substantially all of its assets for the benefit of creditors; or (d) substantially all of the assets of such other Party are seized or attached and not released within ninety (90) days thereafter.

13.5 Termination for Safety Reasons and Efficacy Reason.

(a)  Ono shall have the right to terminate this Agreement, on a Product-by-Product basis, for Safety Reasons upon thirty (30) days written notice to Array or within a shorter period if required under applicable Law, but only after consulting with Array and obtaining Array's agreement with Ono's assessment with respect to such Safety Reasons (or as provided for below, the agreement of the Experts). Ono shall have the right to terminate this Agreement for Efficacy Reasons upon one hundred and eighty (180) days written notice to Array.

(b) If Array disagrees with Ono's assessment with respect to Safety Reasons, such matter shall be resolved in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 17.2, which shall apply mutatis mutandis, which Experts shall determine whether the Safety Reasons are justified and are unlikely to be reversed, within a reasonable period of time with a commercially reasonable level of investment. The opinion of the majority of the Experts shall be finally binding on the Parties.

(c)  "Safety Reasons" shall mean that, based upon all relevant scientific data, there are safety and public health issues relating to the Product such that the medical benefit/risk ratio of such Product is sufficiently unfavorable as to materially compromise the welfare of patients so that the use in patients is no longer justifiable and that such issues are unlikely to be reversed within a reasonable period of time with a commercially reasonable level of investment.

(d) "Efficacy Reasons" shall mean that either (i) there is no efficacy or lower efficacy of the Products in comparison with control arm in COLUMBUS Clinical Study as well as BEACON Clinical Study (neither triplet therapy nor doublet therapy demonstrates statistically significant efficacy in comparison with control arm), or (ii) as of the fifth anniversary of the Effective Date, neither BRAF-mutant Melanoma and Marketing Approval nor BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer have received Marketing Approval from MHLW.

[ * ] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

14.1 Accrued Obligations. The expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason shall not release either Party from any liability which, at the time of such expiration or termination, has already accrued to the other Party or which is attributable to a period prior to such expiration or termination, nor will any termination of this Agreement preclude either Party from pursuing all rights and remedies it may have under this Agreement, or at law or in equity, with respect to breach of this Agreement.

14.2 Rights on Termination of Agreement. In case of termination of this Agreement by either Party, this Section 14.2 shall apply:

(a)  Wind-down.

(i) Development. In the event Ono is the sponsor of or conducting any on-going Clinical Studies of the Product following the date a notice of termination has been issued by Array or Ono, to the extent requested by Array, Ono agrees to: (A) continue to sponsor or conduct any such Clinical Studies in normal course if such Clinical Studies can be completed (i) within [ * ] following the effective date of termination in the case of a termination by Ono pursuant to Section 13.2, or (ii) within [ * ] following the effective date of termination in the case of any other termination of this Agreement by either Party, or (B) promptly transition to Array or its designee such sponsorship or Clinical Studies (or portions thereof) provided that in such case, Array shall take over such studies (i) within [ * ] following the effective date of termination in the case of a termination by Ono pursuant to Section 13.2, or (ii) within [ * ] following the effective date of termination in the case of any other termination of this Agreement by either Party. In addition, in the event Ono is conducting any on-going pre-clinical studies and/or formulation studies (e.g., stability studies) of the Product, Ono agrees to promptly transition to Array or its designee such pre-clinical studies and/or formulation studies to the extent such transfer is reasonably possible. In the case of a termination by Array pursuant to Section 8.2, 13.3 or 13.4 or by Ono pursuant to Section 13.2, Ono shall be responsible for (1) costs of carrying out the transfers described in this Section 14.2(a)(i), and (2) all costs of on-going Clinical Studies through the termination of the wind-down period (including for clarity, the costs incurred by Array in carrying out any transferred Clinical Studies through the termination of the wind-down period). In all other cases Array shall be responsible for such costs. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Ono terminates this Agreement with respect to a Product pursuant to Section 13.5(a), Ono shall not be obligated to continue to sponsor or conduct any Clinical Studies with respect to such Product under Section 14.2(a)(i)(A) above.

(ii) Commercialization. To avoid disruption in the availability of Product to patients, if this Agreement is terminated after the First Commercial Sale of the Product in the Ono Territory other than pursuant to Section 13.5, then to the extent requested by Array, Ono, its Affiliates and its Sublicensees shall continue to distribute (but shall not be obligated to market or promote) the Product, in accordance

66







[ * ] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in each country of the Ono Territory for which Marketing Approval therefor has been obtained, taking into account applicable issues, if any, for patient safety or the requirements of a Regulatory Authority within the Ono Territory, until the date on which Array notifies Ono in writing that Array has secured an alternative distributor or licensee for the Product in such country, but in no event more for than (A) [ * ] after the date of such notice of termination of this Agreement by Ono pursuant to Section 13.2 or by Array pursuant to Section 13.4 or (B) [ * ] after the date of such notice of termination of this Agreement by Array pursuant to Sections 8.2 or 13.3 or by Ono pursuant to Section 13.3 or 13.4 ("Wind- down Period"); provided that Ono, its Affiliates and its Sublicensees shall cease such activities, or any portion thereof, in a given country upon sixty (60) days' notice by Array requesting that such activities (or portion thereof) be ceased. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, during the Wind-down Period, Ono's and its Affiliates' and, subject to Section 14.2(a)(viii) below, Sublicensees' rights with respect to the Product (including the Product Trademarks) in the Ono Territory shall be non- exclusive and, without limiting the foregoing, Array shall have the right to engage one or more other distributor(s) and/or licensee(s) of the Product in all or part of the Ono Territory. Any Product sold or disposed by Ono, its Affiliates and, subject to Section 14.2(a) (viii) below, its Sublicensees in the Ono Territory during the Wind-down Period shall be subject to royalties under Section 6.3 above, provided that in the event of a termination by Ono pursuant to 13.3 or 13.4, if Array requests that Ono continue distributing the Product beyond the first anniversary of the date on which such notice of termination was given, then, the royalties owed by Ono under Section 6.3 above with respect to sales of Product occurring during the remainder of the Wind-down Period shall be reduced by [ * ] of the otherwise applicable royalty rate, provided further that in no event shall such royalties be reduced to less than the royalty due to [ * ] pursuant to that certain agreement dated [ * ]. Within thirty (30) days of expiration of the Wind- down Period, Ono shall notify Array of any quantity of the Product remaining in Ono's inventory and Array shall have the option, upon notice to Ono, to purchase any such quantities of unlabeled and unpackaged Product from Ono at the price equal to the price paid by Ono for such quantities of unlabeled and unpackaged Product manufactured by a Third Party manufacturer or, to the extent Ono manufactured such quantities of unlabeled and unpackaged Products itself, the cost of direct materials and direct labor for such unlabeled and unpackaged Products.

(iii) Assignment of Regulatory Filings and Marketing Approvals. Ono shall assign (or cause to be assigned) to Array or its designee, at Array's cost, except in case of termination by Array pursuant to Section 13.3 or 13.4 or by Ono pursuant to Section 13.2, in which case the expenses will be borne by Ono, (or to the extent not so assignable, Ono shall take all reasonable actions to make available to Array or its designee the benefits of) all Regulatory Filings for the Product in the Ono Territory, including any such Regulatory Filings made or owned by its Affiliates and/or Sublicensees. In each case, unless otherwise required by any applicable Law or regulation or requested by Array, the foregoing assignment (or availability) shall be made within a period of time agreed upon and consistent

67

with Ono's obligations during the Wind Down Period. In addition, Ono shall promptly provide to Array a copy of all Data and Ono Know-How pertaining to the Product in the Ono Territory to the extent not previously provided to Array and Array shall have a fully-paid-up right to use and disclose all Data and Ono Know-How pertaining to the Product following termination of this Agreement, except in case of termination by Ono pursuant to Section 13.3 or 13.4, in which case the Section 14.2(a)(ix) shall apply. In addition, all such Data and Ono Know-How, to the extent solely related to the Product, shall be deemed Confidential Information of Array and not Confidential Information of Ono (and will not be subject to the exclusions under Sections 10.1(a) or (e) above).

(iv) Transition. Each Party shall use Diligent Efforts to cooperate with the other and/or its designee to effect a smooth and orderly transition in the Development, sale and ongoing marketing, promotion and commercialization of the Product in the Ono Territory during the Wind-down Period and to conduct in an expeditious manner any activities to be conducted under this Section 14.2. Without limiting the foregoing, Ono shall, upon written request from Array, provide Array copies of customer lists, customer data and other customer information relating to the Product in the Ono Territory (except as prevented by the applicable Laws and regulations relating to the protection of personal information), which Array shall have the right to use and disclose. For clarity, "customers" means prescribers and individuals and entities with the ability to influence use of the Product (e.g. individuals responsible for hospital formularies and/or making purchasing decisions on behalf of the hospital) that are called on by Ono representatives when detailing the Product.

(v) Licenses. Effective as of the date of expiration, Ono shall grant to Array a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license, with the right to grant sublicenses, (A) under any Improvements, and (B) under any other Patents owned or Controlled by Ono related to any Product(s) (including without limitation, Ono's interest in any Joint Patents) for the purposes of making, using, developing, importing, selling, distributing, marketing and promoting the Product(s) in the form they exist as of the time the Agreement is terminated, Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a termination by Ono pursuant Section 13.3 or 13.4, Section 14.2(a)(ix) shall apply.

(vi) Return of Materials. Within ninety (90) days after the end of the Wind-down Period, upon request by Array, Ono shall either deliver to Array or destroy all tangible items comprising, bearing or containing trademarks of Array (including the Product Trademarks), trade names, patents, copyrights, designs, drawings, formulas or other Data, photographs, samples, literature, sales and promotional aids ("Product Materials") and Confidential Information of Array, that is in Ono's possession, subject to Ono's right to keep one (1) copy for archiving purposes. Effective upon the end of the Wind-down Period, Ono shall cease to use all trademarks and trade names of Array (including the Product Trademarks) in the Ono Territory, and all rights granted to Ono hereunder with respect to the Product in the Ono Territory shall terminate.

68

(vii) Marks and Domains. Effective upon the effective date of termination, Ono hereby assigns and shall cause to be assigned to Array all worldwide rights in and to (i) any Product Trademarks specific to one or more Products that Ono or any of its Affiliates used in connection with Product(s), and (ii) all Internet domain names incorporating the applicable Product Trademark(s) or any variation or part of such Product Trademark(s) as its URL address or any part of such address, for domains outside the Array Territory. It is understood that such assignment shall not include the name of Ono or any of its Affiliates, nor the corporate logo, service mark, or trademark for Ono or for any of its Affiliates as a corporate entity.

(viii) Sublicensees. Any contracts with Sublicensees in the Ono Territory engaged by Ono shall, at the request of Array in its discretion, be assigned to Array to the furthest extent possible; provided that such assignment is accepted by the Sublicensee(s) in any country or countries within the Ono Territory. In the event such assignment is not requested by Array or is not accepted by such Sublicensee(s), then the rights of such Sublicensees with respect to the Product in relevant country or countries within the Ono Territory shall terminate upon the termination of Ono's rights with respect to the Ono Territory. Subject to Ono's Affiliates' and Sublicensees' obligations under Section 14.2(a)(ii) above, Ono shall ensure that its Affiliates and such Sublicensees (if not assigned to Array pursuant to this Section 14.2(a)(viii)) shall transition all rights in and to the Product back to Array in the manner set forth in this Section 14.2 as if such Affiliate or Sublicensee were named herein.

(ix) Following a termination by Ono pursuant to Section 13.3 or 13.4, in the event that Array wishes to have Ono: (A) assign to Array the Regulatory Filings for the Product in the Ono Territory and provide to Array a copy of all Data and Ono Know-How pertaining to the Product as described in 14.2(a)(iii) above, and/or (B) grant to Array a non-exclusive license under any Improvements, and/or under any other Patents owned or Controlled by Ono related to any Product(s) (including without limitation, Ono's interest in any Joint Patents) as described in 14.2(a)(v) above, Array shall so notify Ono and Ono shall make such rights for consideration consistent with then-prevailing market conditions, on customary terms and conditions to be negotiated in good faith. In the event that the Parties cannot finalize such an agreement within sixty (60) days of commencing negotiations with respect thereto, the agreement shall be referred for resolution pursuant to Section 17.3 applied mutatis mutandis to such agreement.

14.3 Liquidated Damages. In the event that Array (a) [ * ] during [ * ], or (b) intentionally conceals or falsifies a material result and/or material item of data concerning the safety or efficacy of the Product, which concealment or falsification (i) is undertaken to induce Ono to not terminate this Agreement and (ii) results in a substantial reduction to the value of the Product in the Ono Territory, then, as an alternative to its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 13.3 above, Ono may in its discretion elect to continue this Agreement, in which case (A) Ono shall be relieved of its due diligence obligations under this Agreement; and (B) as liquidated damages for the breaches described

69







[ * ] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

in (a) or (b) above, the otherwise applicable royalty rate with respect to Products shall thereafter be [ * ] for the [ * ].

14.4 No Renewal, Extension or Waiver. Acceptance of any order from, or sale or license of, any Product to Ono after the notice or effective date of expiration or termination of this Agreement in its entirety shall not be construed as a renewal or extension hereof, or as a waiver of expiration or termination of this Agreement in its entirety.

14.5 Survival. Upon the expiration or termination of this Agreement, all rights and obligations of the Parties under this Agreement shall terminate except those described in the following Articles and Sections: Articles I (Definitions), XIV (Effect of Termination), XVI (Indemnification; Recalls) and XVII (Dispute Resolution), and Sections 2.7, 4.10, 4.11 (to the extent required by applicable Law), Sections 6.2-6.5 and 7.1-7.3 (with respect to milestone payments and royalty payments accruing prior to, but not yet paid as of, the effective date of termination); 7.4 (for a period of three (3) years from the end of the calendar quarter in which termination or expiration occurs, or if later, (3) years after the last relevant payment was made under this Agreement), Sections 10.1-10.3, 10.4 (to the extent any Confidential Information of Ono would be included in any publication of Data pursuant to Section 10.4), 10.5 (to the extent any Confidential Information of Ono would be included in any abstract, slide presentation or poster pursuant to Section 10.5) ; 11.1(a)-(c), 11.2(b), 11.3 (with respect to any enforcement actions being prosecuted by Ono as of the effective date of termination, but only until such enforcement action can be assumed by Array), 12.6 (with respect to Ono's obligation to transfer or withdraw registration of Internet domain names registered by Ono pursuant to this section and Array's ownership and other rights with respect to the Domain Names), 18.3, 18.7, 18.8, 18.13 and 18.14 and, in addition, any other provisions of this Agreement shall survive solely for so long as, and to the extent, reasonably necessary to enable Ono to perform its obligations under Section 14.2, and to the extent that any Product is sold during the period defined in Section 14.2(a)(ii) above, Sections 6.2-6.4 and 7.1-7.3 shall apply to such sales and Array's information, audit an inspection rights under Sections 4.7(b) and 4.9 shall continue to apply.

The Parties agree that the Parties shall retain and may fully exercise all of their rights and elections under the United States Bankruptcy Code, Article 53 and 56 of the Japanese bankruptcy Law (or any comparable provision of Japanese Laws applicable to bankruptcies or insolvencies), and other similar foreign Laws.

NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, NOTHING IN THIS SECTION 16.5 IS INTENDED TO OR SHALL LIMIT OR RESTRICT THE AMOUNTS PAYABLE TO THIRD PARTIES UNDER THE INDEMNITIES PROVIDED PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 10, SECTIONS 16.1 AND 16.2 ABOVE; PROVIDED, FURTHER, THAT THE FOREGOING LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY IN THE CASE OF GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT.

The Senior Executives (or their respective designees) shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such dispute through discussions promptly following such written notice. If the Senior Executives cannot resolve the dispute within forty-five (45) days of such written notice, or either Party concludes that the matter will not be so resolved, then, (a) with respect to disputes or decisions regarding matters described in Section 17.2(a), the provisions set forth in Section 17.2 shall apply, and (b) with respect to all other disputes, the provisions of Section 17.3 shall apply. If the Parties should resolve such dispute pursuant to the procedures in this Section 17.1, a memorandum setting forth their agreement will be prepared and signed by both Parties, if requested by either Party.

17.2 Resolution of Certain Disputes.

(a)  Application to Certain Disputes. The provisions of this Section 17.2 shall apply with respect to any dispute that has not been resolved following referral to Senior Executives described in Section 17.1, where such dispute concerns any matter (i) to be decided by the JDRC or JCC and for which a different means of resolution (e.g., a deciding vote of either Party) is not specified pursuant to Section 3.5 above, or (ii) that is otherwise expressly provided for in this Agreement to be resolved pursuant to this Section 17.2 (each of the foregoing cases referred to as an "Expert Dispute").

(b) Resolution by Experts.

(c)  Selection of Experts. Each Party shall select an independent Third Party expert who is neutral, disinterested and impartial, is not affiliated with either Party, has expertise and experience relevant to the specific subject matter of the particular Expert Dispute, and does not have a conflict of interest, and two experts so elected shall elect the third expert with qualification as set forth above (the three experts so selected, the "Experts"). Once the Experts have been selected, each Party shall, in accordance with mutually agreed timelines and procedures, but in no event later than fifteen (15) Business Days from the selection of the Experts, provide the Experts and the other Party with a written report setting forth its position with respect to the substance of the Expert Dispute and may submit a revised or updated report and position to the Experts as mutually agreed or as determined by the Experts. If so requested by the Experts, each Party shall make oral submissions to the Experts based on such Party's written report delivered pursuant to this Section 17.2(c), and each Party shall have the right to be present during any such oral submissions.

(d) Determination by the Experts. The Experts shall, no later than ten (10) Business Days after the last submission of the written reports and, if any, oral submissions, select one of the Parties' positions as their final decision, and shall not have the authority to modify either Party's position or render any substantive decision other than to so select the position of either Ono or Array as set forth in their respective written report (as initially submitted, or as revised in accordance with Section 17.2(c), as applicable). The Parties agree that the decision of the Experts shall be the sole, exclusive and binding remedy between them regarding any Expert Dispute presented to the Experts, provided that the Experts' decision with respect to disputes referred to it pursuant to Section 3.5 shall become the decision of the JDRC on the matter for all purposes of this Agreement. The proceedings and the decision of the Experts shall not be made public without the joint consent of the Parties and each Party shall maintain the confidentiality of such proceedings and decision unless each Party otherwise agrees in writing; provided that either Party may make such disclosures as are permitted for Confidential Information of the other Party under Article 10 above.

(e)  Timetable for Completion in Thirty (30) business days. The Parties shall use, and shall direct the Experts to use, diligent efforts to resolve any Expert Dispute within thirty (30) Business Days after the selection of the Experts, or if resolution within thirty (30) Business Days is not reasonably achievable, as determined by the Experts, then as soon thereafter as is reasonably practicable, provided that the Experts shall resolve the Expert Dispute no later than ninety (90) Business Days after the selection of the Experts.

78







[ * ] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

or appropriate, any dispute arising out of or in connection with this Agreement (each, a "Dispute") shall be exclusively resolved by final and binding arbitration as follows:

(a)  Arbitration under the ICC Rules of Arbitration. The arbitration shall be conducted by three (3) arbitrators according to the ICC Rules of Arbitration ("Rules"), and the panel of three arbitrators so selected is referred to herein as the "Arbitration Tribunal." The seat of the arbitration shall be in Osaka, Japan, if it is demanded by Array, and in New York, NY, USA, if it is demanded by Ono, with hearings to held in the same location. The Emergency Arbitrator Provisions shall not apply.

(b) Conduct of the proceedings. The language of arbitration shall be English. If so requested by the Arbitration Tribunal, any documents originally in a language other than English shall be submitted with an English translation.

If the tribunal orders production of documents, the tribunal shall take guidance from the IBA Rules on the Taking of Evidence in International Arbitration as current on the dated the commencement of the arbitration. The Parties wish to avoid a costly and time-consuming discovery exercise. The Arbitration Tribunal shall have the power to appoint one or more experts after having consulted with the Parties. For the avoidance of doubt, the governing law set forth in Section 18.3 shall not apply to determine any procedural issues. In particular, but without in any way restricting the generality of the foregoing, the Parties agree that the procedural rules of the governing law set forth in Section 18.3 shall not apply with respect to document production or other evidentiary issues, except that all privileges restricting disclosure established under such governing law shall apply and may be invoked by both Parties

(c)  Time limit for rendering the award. The Parties and the Arbitration Tribunal shall endeavor to complete any arbitration within twelve (12) months following the full constitution of the Arbitration Tribunal. However, this period is not a deadline and failure to render an award within them shall not be a ground for annulment of an award.

(d) Decision of the Arbitration Tribunal. Every award shall be binding on the Parties. By submitting the dispute to arbitration under the Rules, the Parties undertake to carry out any award without delay and shall be deemed to have waived their right to any form of recourse insofar as such waiver can validly be made. The Parties agree that they can seek recognition and enforcement of any order and/or award made by the Arbitration Tribunal before any competent court. The Arbitration Tribunal shall have no authority to award punitive damages or other damages exceeding the damages actually suffered by the prevailing Party, and may not, in any event, make any ruling, finding or award that does not conform to the provisions of this Agreement. The fees and expenses of the Arbitration Tribunal (the translation fee described Section 17.3 (b) shall be

79







[ * ] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

included) shall be shared equally by the Parties, and each Party shall bear its own expenses incurred in connection with the proceeding, in each case unless the Arbitration Tribunal in the award assesses such fees and/or expenses against one of the Parties or allocates such fees and expenses other than equally between the Parties.

(e)  Confidentiality. The existence and content of the Arbitration proceedings and any rulings or award shall be deemed Confidential Information of both Parties hereunder and kept confidential by the Parties and members of the Arbitration Tribunal except (i) where such disclosure is permitted under Article 10 of this Agreement, (ii) to the extent that disclosure may be required of a Party to fulfil a legal duty, protect or pursue a legal right, or enforce or challenge an award in bona fide legal proceedings before a state court or other judicial authority, (iii) with the consent of all Parties made in writing subsequently to this Agreement, (iii) where needed for the preparation or presentation of a claim or defense in this arbitration, (iv) where such information is already in the public domain other than as a result of a breach of this clause, or (v) by order of the Arbitration Tribunal upon application of a Party.

(f)  Non-Disclosure of Communications with Internal Counsel. Notwithstanding any rights to the contrary under applicable procedural or substantive rules of Law, any communications exchanged between members of each Party's respective legal department and directors, employees or agents in connection with any disputes, investigations, administrative or other proceedings, shall not be requested, produced or otherwise used, to the extent such communications would have been covered by legal privilege and not disclosable, had these communications been exchanged between such Party and its external attorneys.

(g) Interim Relief. The Arbitration Tribunal shall have the power to grant any remedy or relief that it deems appropriate, whether provisional or final, including but not limited to conservatory relief and injunctive relief, and any such measures ordered by the Arbitration Tribunal shall, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the governing law selected by the Parties pursuant to Section 18.3, be deemed to be a final award on the subject matter of the measures and shall be enforceable as such. Each Party retains the right to apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for provisional and/or conservatory relief, including injunctions or temporary restraining orders before or after the constitution of the Arbitration Tribunal, and any such request shall not be deemed incompatible with the Agreement to arbitrate or a waiver of the right to arbitrate.
