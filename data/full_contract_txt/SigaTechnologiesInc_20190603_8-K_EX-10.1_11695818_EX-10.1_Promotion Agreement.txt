6.5 Audits. SIGA may have an independent top four certified public accountant, reasonably acceptable to MMT ("SIGA's Auditor"), have access during normal business hours, and upon [***] Business Days' prior written notice, to examine only those records of MMT (and its Affiliates and sublicensees) as may be reasonably necessary to determine, with respect to any Calendar Year ending not more than [***] before SIGA's request, the correctness or completeness of any report or payment made under this Agreement; provided, however, MMT shall not be required to provide, and neither SIGA nor SIGA's Auditor shall be entitled to review, the tax returns or tax records of MMT or those of its Affiliates and sublicensees. The foregoing right of review may be exercised only once per year and only once with respect to each periodic report and payment delivered in accordance with Section 6.2. Reports of the results of any such examination (each an "Audit Report") will be (a) limited to details of any discrepancies in MMT's records relating to the Product together with an explanation of the discrepancy and the circumstances giving rise to the discrepancy (b) made available to both Parties and (c) subject to ARTICLE 10. An Audit Report shall become final and binding on the Parties thirty (30) days following MMT's receipt thereof, unless MMT delivers written notice of its agreement thereto (in which case such Audit Report shall become final and binding on the date of delivery of such notice of agreement) or written notice of its disagreement thereto ("Notice of Disagreement") to SIGA in either case on or prior to such date. If a timely Notice of Disagreement is delivered by MMT to SIGA, then the Audit Report shall become final and binding on the Parties on the earlier of (i) the date MMT and SIGA resolve in writing any differences they have with respect to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement, and (ii) the date all matters in dispute are finally resolved in writing by the Independent Auditor. During the thirty (30) days following delivery of a Notice of Disagreement, MMT, SIGA and SIGA's Auditor shall seek to resolve in writing any differences which they may have with respect to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement. At the end of such thirty (30) day period, if no resolution has been reached, MMT and SIGA shall submit such dispute to an independent top four certified public accountant other than SIGA's Auditor and reasonably acceptable to both Parties (the "Independent Auditor") for resolution of all matters which remain in dispute which were included in the Notice of Disagreement, and the Independent Auditor shall make a final determination with respect thereto (with it being understood that the Parties will request that the Independent Auditor deliver to the Parties its resolution in writing not more than 30 days after its engagement). The Independent Auditor shall make a determination only with respect to the matters still in dispute and, with respect to each such matter, its determination shall be within the range of the dispute among MMT, SIGA and SIGA's Auditor. If an Audit Report as finally determined pursuant to this Section 6.5 (a "Final Audit Report") concludes that (i) additional amounts were owed by MMT, MMT will pay the additional amounts, or (ii) excess payments were made by MMT, SIGA will reimburse such excess payments, in either case ((i) or (ii)), within thirty (30) Business Days after the date on which an Audit Report is deemed a Final Audit Report. SIGA will bear the full cost of the performance of any such audit, including the fees of SIGA's Auditor and the Independent Auditor, unless a Final Audit Report, which covers the entire Calendar Year, discloses a variance to the detriment of the auditing Party of more than [***] from the amount of the original report, royalty or payment calculation, in which case MMT will bear the full cost of the performance of such audit. The results of such audit, including any determination made by the Independent Auditor, will be final, absent manifest error.

6.6 Blocked Payment and Indemnification. If either Party utilizes a Restricted Party in the activities contemplated under this Agreement, without a license or other authorization required by Global Trade Control Laws or in circumstances where reimbursement by the non-utilizing Party would violate or create exposure to adverse consequences under Global Trade Laws, the non-utilizing Party shall not be responsible for any payments due to the utilizing Party or any other party resulting from the activities involving such Restricted Party even if the contractual obligation related thereto has already accrued. Any and all payments due to such utilizing Party or any other party resulting from such activity involving a Restricted Party shall be entirely at such utilizing Party's expense. Further, if the conduct of any activity or a transaction under this Agreement was in violation of applicable Global Trade Control Laws for any reason, such violating Party shall indemnify the other Party for any liability resulting from such activity or transaction, including any and all fines and penalties assessed to such other Party as a result of such activity or transaction. 6.7 Source of Recovery. Any outstanding amounts due and payable by SIGA pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, including reimbursements for Supply Penalties pursuant to Section 5.5 and any amounts owed to an MMT Indemnitee pursuant to SIGA's indemnification obligations in Section 9.1, at MMT's option, can be set-off by MMT from any Quarterly Payment until such amounts are fully recovered; provided that any amounts that are subject to a dispute properly brought under ARTICLE 12 may not be set-off pursuant to this Section 6.7. 6.8 Taxes. (a) Taxes on Income. Each Party will pay all taxes (including related interest and penalties) imposed on its share of income arising directly or indirectly from the efforts of, or the receipt or deemed receipt of any payment by, such Party under this Agreement. (b) Tax Withholding. Subject to Section 6.8(c) and Section 6.8(d), if any taxes (including related interest and penalties) are required to be withheld by or on behalf of MMT with respect to an amount payable to SIGA, (a) MMT will withhold such taxes from such amount, timely pay the withheld taxes to the proper taxing authority and furnish reasonably satisfactory proof of payment to SIGA; and (b) SIGA will reasonably assist MMT in its efforts to obtain a refund of or credit for such withholding tax in accordance with Section 6.8(c). Any amount actually withheld and remitted by MMT to a taxing authority pursuant to this Section 6.8(b) will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to SIGA. If MMT makes a payment without deduction for tax withholding and an amount of tax should have been withheld from such payment, MMT shall be entitled to recover the under withheld tax by an additional withholding from any amount payable to SIGA under this Agreement, and to the extent such recovery is insufficient, SIGA shall indemnify MMT for any such amount. No amount shall be withheld, or a reduced amount shall be withheld, as applicable, if, in accordance with Section 6.8(d), a Party that is entitled to a payment timely furnishes the other Party with the necessary tax forms and other documents prescribed by Laws, which shall be in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Party receiving the documents, identifying that the relevant payment is exempt from tax or subject to a reduced tax rate.

(c) VAT. It is understood and agreed between the Parties that the amount of any payments contemplated under this Agreement are exclusive of any value added tax, sales tax or any similar tax ("VAT"), which shall be added thereon as applicable.

(d) Tax Cooperation. The Parties agree to cooperate with one another and use reasonable efforts to reduce or eliminate tax withholding, VAT or similar obligations in respect of royalties, milestone payments, and other amounts payable under this Agreement. SIGA and MMT will provide each other with any applicable tax forms that may be reasonably necessary in order for the other Party not to withhold tax or to withhold tax at a reduced rate under an applicable income tax treaty or pursuant to applicable internal law. Each Party will provide the other with reasonable assistance to enable the recovery, as permitted by Law, of withholding taxes, VAT, or similar obligations resulting from payments made under this Agreement, such recovery to be for the benefit of MMT or SIGA, as applicable, to the extent it has complied with the requirements of this Section 6.8 in respect of such obligations.

The Party claiming indemnity under this ARTICLE 9 (the "Indemnified Party") shall give written notice to the Party from whom indemnity is being sought (the "Indemnifying Party") promptly after becoming aware of a Claim for which indemnity may be sought hereunder (it being understood and agreed, however, that the failure by an Indemnified Party to give notice of a Claim for which indemnity may be sought as provided in this Section 9.3 shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligation under this Agreement except that in no event shall the Indemnifying Party be liable for any Losses that result from any delay in providing such notice).

The Indemnifying Party will not settle any Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, not to be unreasonably withheld, unless the settlement involves only the payment of money by the Indemnifying Party. So long as the Indemnifying Party is actively defending the Claim in good faith, the Indemnified Party will not settle or compromise any such Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party does not assume and conduct the defense of the Claim as provided above, (a) the Indemnified Party may defend against, consent to the entry of any judgment, or enter into any settlement with respect to such Claim in any manner the Indemnified Party may deem reasonably appropriate (and the Indemnified Party need not consult with, or obtain any consent from, the Indemnifying Party in connection therewith), and (b) the Indemnifying Party will remain responsible to indemnify the Indemnified Party as provided in this ARTICLE 9.

In relation to the other Party's review of such an announcement, such other Party may make specific, reasonable comments on such proposed press release within the prescribed time for commentary, but will not withhold, condition, or delay its consent to disclosure of the information. Neither Party nor their respective Affiliates are required to seek the permission of the other Party to repeat any information regarding the terms of this Agreement that has already been publicly disclosed by such Party or its Affiliate, or by the other Party or its Affiliate, in accordance with this Section 10.4, if such information remains accurate as of such time.

This Agreement, including the Schedules and Exhibits hereto, together with the confidentiality agreements referenced in Section 10.5, and any other documents delivered pursuant hereto or thereto, sets forth the complete, final and exclusive agreement and all the covenants, promises, agreements, warranties, representations, conditions and understandings between the Parties hereto and thereto and their Affiliates with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes, as of the Effective Date, all prior and contemporaneous agreements and understandings between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. There are no covenants, promises, agreements, warranties, representations, conditions or understandings, either oral or written, between the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement other than as are set forth in this Agreement. No subsequent alteration, amendment, change or addition to this Agreement will be binding upon the Parties unless reduced to writing and signed by an authorized officer of each Party. 13.2 Force Majeure. Both Parties will be excused from the performance of their obligations under this Agreement to the extent that such performance is prevented by force majeure and the non-performing Party promptly provides notice of the prevention to the other Party.

13.5 Assignment. Neither Party may assign or transfer this Agreement or any rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the other Party, except that a Party may make such an assignment without the other Party's consent to its Affiliates or to a Third Party successor of, or transferee to, assets of such Party to which this Agreement relates, whether in a merger, sale of stock, sale of assets or other transaction. Any successor or assignee of rights or obligations permitted hereunder will, in writing to the other Party, expressly assume performance of such rights or obligations. Any permitted assignment will be binding on the successors of the assigning Party. Any assignment or attempted assignment by either Party in violation of the terms of this Section 13.5 is null, void and of no legal effect. 13.6 Performance by Affiliates. Subject to Section 2.1(b), each Party may discharge any obligations and exercise any right hereunder through any of its Affiliates. Each Party hereby guarantees the performance by its Affiliates of such Party's obligations under this Agreement, and will cause its Affiliates to comply with the provisions of this Agreement in connection with such performance. Any breach by a Party's Affiliate of any of such Party's obligations under this Agreement is a breach by such Party, and the other Party may proceed directly against such Party without any obligation to first proceed against such Party's Affiliate. 13.7 Further Assurances and Actions. Each Party, upon the request of the other Party, whether made before or after the Effective Date and without further consideration, will do, execute, acknowledge, and deliver or cause to be done, executed, acknowledged or delivered all such further acts, deeds, documents, assignments, transfers, conveyances, powers of attorney, instruments and assurances as may be reasonably necessary to effect complete consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and to do all such other acts, as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes and intent of this Agreement. The Parties agree to execute and deliver such other documents, certificates, agreements and other writings and to take such other actions as may be reasonably necessary to consummate or implement expeditiously the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

13.8 Severability. Each of the provisions contained in this Agreement will be severable, and the unenforceability of one will not affect the enforceability of any others or of the remainder of this Agreement. If any one or more of the provisions of this Agreement, or the application thereof in any circumstances, is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any respect for any reason, the Parties will negotiate in good faith with a view to the substitution therefor of a suitable and equitable solution to carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid provision; provided, however, that the validity, legality and enforceability of any such provision in every other respect and of the remaining provisions of this Agreement will not be in any way impaired thereby, it being intended that all of the rights and privileges of the Parties hereto will be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by Law. 13.9 No Waiver. Any term or condition of this Agreement may be waived at any time by the Party that is entitled to the benefit thereof, but no such waiver will be effective unless set forth in a written instrument duly executed by or on behalf of the Party waiving such term or condition. The waiver, delay or the failure of any Party to enforce or exercise any term, condition or part of this Agreement at any time or in any one or more instances will not be deemed to be or construed as a waiver of the same or any other term, condition or part, nor will it forfeit any rights, power or privilege to future enforcement thereof. No single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege will preclude any other or further exercise of such right, power or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. To the maximum extent permitted by Law, (a) no claim or right arising out of this Agreement or any of the documents referred to in this Agreement can be discharged by one Party, in whole or in part, by a waiver or renunciation of the claim or right unless in writing signed by the other Party; (b) no waiver that may be given by a Party will be applicable except in the specific instance for which it is given; and (c) no notice to or demand on one Party will be deemed to be a waiver of any obligation of that Party or of the right of the Party giving such notice or demand to take further action without notice or demand as provided in this Agreement or the documents referred to in this Agreement. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, all rights and remedies available to a Party, whether under this Agreement or afforded by Law or otherwise, will be cumulative and not in the alternative to any other rights or remedies that may be available to such Party. 13.10 Relationship of the Parties. Neither Party will have any responsibility for the hiring, termination or compensation of the other Party's employees or for any employee benefits of such employee. No employee or representative of a Party will have any authority to bind or obligate the other Party to this Agreement for any sum or in any manner whatsoever, or to create or impose any contractual or other liability on the other Party without said Party's approval. For all purposes, and notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, SIGA's legal relationship to MMT under this Agreement will be that of independent contractor and nothing in this Agreement gives either Party the power or authority to act for, bind, or commit the other Party in any way. This Agreement is not a partnership agreement. Nothing in this Agreement will be construed to establish a relationship of partners, principal and agent or joint venturers between the Parties or their respective employees or Affiliates. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed to create a "separate entity" or "business entity" within the meaning of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code or the regulations thereunder and any foreign equivalents thereto. Neither MMT nor SIGA will make any statements, representations, or commitments of any kind, or to take any action that is binding on the other, without the prior consent of the other Party to do so.

SCHEDULE 3

Safety Reporting Requirements

Safety Reporting Requirements for the Product

1. Scope: SIGA has a legal and corporate responsibility to comply with applicable regulations governing the collection and reporting of adverse events ("AE(s)"), at risk scenarios ("ARSs"), unexpected therapeutic effects ("UTEs"), and product quality complaints ("PQC(s)") associated with the Product, as these terms are defined below. For the purposes of this Exhibit, AEs, ARSs, UTEs, and PQCs are collectively termed "Safety Reports."

MMT is expressly entitled to perform any regulatory responsibilities for the Product through any of its Affiliates. MMT or an Affiliate of MMT shall exchange Safety Reports with the SIGA contact listed in section 4.1 Reporting Time-Frames. Throughout this Safety Reporting Exhibit, SIGA shall be referred to as "SIGA" and MMT and its Affiliates collectively as "Promoter." At all times SIGA and Promoter shall follow the procedures set out below.

The procedures described in this Agreement are to be followed for pharmacovigilance activities for the Product, irrespective of any other activities between SIGA and Promoter which are contained within the Agreement.

2. Definitions: 2.1. Adverse event (AE): an AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered the Product. The event need not have a causal relationship with the treatment or usage. This includes, but is not limited to: â¢ Abnormal test findings â¢ Clinically significant symptoms and signs

Source: SIGA TECHNOLOGIES INC, 8-K, 6/3/2019





â¢ Changes in physical examination findings â¢ Hypersensitivity â¢ Progression/worsening of underlying disease â¢ Lack of drug efficacy â¢ Drug abuse â¢ Drug dependency â¢ Signs and symptoms resulting from drug withdrawal and drug interactions â¢ Suspected transmission of an infectious agent via a medicinal product 2.2. At risk scenarios (ARSs): circumstances where the report does not include an AE per se, but nevertheless needs to be reported to SIGA. These circumstances include: â¢ Medication errors (including incorrect prescription or dispensing of a prescription, whether or not administered to the patient) â¢ Exposure during pregnancy â¢ Exposure during breastfeeding â¢ Overdose â¢ Extravasation â¢ Occupational exposure â¢ Off-label use 2.3. Unexpected therapeutic effect (UTEs): a beneficial therapeutic effect of the Product aside from the use for which it had been given. 2.4. Product quality complaint (PQC(s)): is any written or oral expression of dissatisfaction relative to the physical properties, condition, labelling, potency and/or packaging of the Product, including whether the Product is suspected or confirmed to be counterfeit.

3. Promoter Responsibilities: 3.1. Promoter shall ensure that all employees and, if applicable, subcontractor employees performing activities under this Agreement ("Promoter Personnel") who may become aware of a Safety Report associated with the use of the Product comply with the requirements set out in this Exhibit. 3.2. If Promoter Personnel become aware of a Safety Report that may be associated with the Product, Promoter shall inform SIGA in accordance with the reporting procedures included in this Exhibit and as may be updated and provided to Promoter in the future by SIGA. 3.3. In the event Promoter engages a subcontractor to perform services related to this Agreement, Promoter shall request fulfilment by that subcontractor of these safety reporting requirements on substantially the same terms as those outlined in this Exhibit, unless it is established that there is no possibility that the subcontracted services will involve receipt or handling of Safety Reports by the subcontractor.

Source: SIGA TECHNOLOGIES INC, 8-K, 6/3/2019





3.4. In the event that Promoter receives a communication from a Regulatory Authority relating to the Product, Promoter shall inform SIGA as soon as possible, but in any event no later than one (1) Business Day or three (3) calendar days of receipt, whichever is shorter. Where possible, SIGA shall be informed prior to, and have the opportunity to review, any response to the regulatory authority by Promoter.

4. Reporting Process: 4.1. Reporting Time-Frames: Promoter shall report all Safety Reports to SIGA within two (2) Business Days or four (4) calendar days of awareness, whichever is shorter. All reports shall be sent to:
