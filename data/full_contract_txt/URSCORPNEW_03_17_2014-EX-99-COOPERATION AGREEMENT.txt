3. Board Nomination and Other Company Matters.

(1) increase the size of the Board to fourteen (14) members; and

(2) appoint Diane C. Creel, William H. Schumann, III, David N. Siegel and V. Paul Unruh (together, the "JANA Nominees") (other than in the case of the refusal or inability of any such person to serve, in which case, the Board shall appoint his/her substitute chosen in accordance with Section 3(c)) as Company directors to fill the vacancies created thereby and to have the same rights of participation in all other matters undertaken at the March Board Meeting as the other Company directors; provided, however, that as a condition to the appointment of each JANA Nominee, such JANA Nominee shall have completed and executed the Company's 2014 Questionnaire for Potential Director Nominees and the Director Nominee Representation and Agreement, provided that such documents have not been amended in any material respect from the versions provided to JANA prior to the date of this Agreement, and have agreed to comply with all policies, codes of conduct, confidentiality obligations and codes of ethics applicable to all of the Company's directors, including the Company's Code of Business Conduct, to provide the information regarding themselves that is required to be disclosed for candidates for directors and directors in a proxy statement under the federal securities laws of the United States of America and/or applicable New York Stock Exchange rules and regulations, and to provide such other customary information as reasonably requested by the Company; and provided, further that any JANA Nominee may participate in the March Board Meeting telephonically if unable to attend in person.

(b) The Company agrees that:







  (1) the Board will not approve any material new transactions prior to the March Board Meeting;

(2) at the 2014 annual meeting of the Company's shareholders (the "2014 Annual Meeting"), the Board will nominate the JANA Nominees (other than in the case of the resignation, refusal or inability of any such person to serve, in which case, the Board shall nominate his/her substitute chosen in accordance with Section 3(c)), together with the other persons included in the Company's slate of nominees for election as director at the 2014 Annual Meeting in accordance with Section 3(d), as directors of the Company, in each case with a term expiring at the 2015 annual meeting of the Company's shareholders (the "2015 Annual Meeting");

(3) the Board will recommend that the shareholders of the Company vote to elect the JANA Nominees as directors of the Company at the 2014 Annual Meeting;

(4) the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts (which shall include the solicitation of proxies) to obtain the election of the JANA Nominees at the 2014 Annual Meeting (it being understood that such efforts shall be not less than the efforts used by the Company to obtain the election of any other independent (as determined under Section 303A of the New York Stock Exchange's Listed Company Manual) director nominee nominated by it to serve as a director on the Board at the 2014 Annual Meeting); and

(5) two individuals who are Company directors as of the date of this Agreement (other than Martin M. Koffel, or in addition to Mr. Koffel if applicable under Section 4(b) of this Agreement) will not seek re-election to the Board at the 2014 Annual Meeting, and the Company shall not seek to fill such vacancies.

(c) The Company agrees that if any of the JANA Nominees resigns as a director or otherwise refuses to or is unable to serve as a director at any time prior to the 2015 Annual Meeting, including as a result of death or disability, JANA shall be entitled to designate a replacement director who shall be independent of JANA, would be considered an independent director of the Company under Section 303A of the New York Stock Exchange's Listed Company Manual, is reasonably acceptable to the Board as a replacement director and has a comparable amount of business experience, although such experience need not be in the same industry or industries, and is in equally good standing in all material respects, as the JANA Nominee being replaced. For the avoidance of doubt, the substitute director shall thereafter be deemed a JANA Nominee for purposes of this Agreement and be entitled to the same rights and subject to the same requirements under this Agreement applicable to the resigning JANA Nominee prior to his or her resignation, and such person shall be appointed to the Board to serve the unexpired term, if any, of such JANA Nominee.

(d) Other than the JANA Nominees, the Board will only nominate eight (8) individuals for election at the 2014 Annual Meeting, including Mr. Koffel subject to Section 4(b) of this Agreement.

(e) Promptly following the 2014 Annual Meeting, the Board will decrease the size of the Board to twelve (12) members. Until the 2015 Annual Meeting, the Company shall not increase the size of the Board in excess of twelve (12) members, and shall not decrease the size of the Board if such decrease would require the resignation of one or more of the JANA Nominees. Other than for vacancies filled pursuant to Section 3(c) or arising as a result of a breach of this Agreement by the Company, nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the Company from filling all vacancies in accordance with the By-Laws of the Company.







  (f) The Company will take appropriate action so that, prior to the 2015 Annual Meeting, its director change of position policy does not require a JANA Nominee to resign by reason of any material change in his or her primary job responsibility or position held at the time such JANA Nominee was appointed to the Board.

4. CEO Succession.

(a) At the March Board Meeting, the Company shall appoint two JANA Nominees chosen by JANA to the CEO Succession Committee of the Board (the "CEO Succession Committee") and shall appoint such JANA Nominees to any other committee currently or in the future designated to review or oversee the selection process for a successor to Mr. Koffel as chief executive officer or substantially similar position (the "New CEO"), and shall not otherwise increase the size of the CEO Succession Committee or any such other committee. In the event of the replacement as set forth in Section 3(c) of any JANA Nominee appointed to the CEO Succession Committee pursuant to this Section 5, his or her successor shall be promptly appointed to the committee seat vacated by such former director to serve until the 2015 Annual Meeting. The CEO Succession Committee and any other committee currently or in the future designated to review or oversee the selection process for the New CEO shall not take any material action prior to the March Board Meeting.

(b) In order to ensure an orderly transition, Mr. Koffel may in his sole discretion continue (including, for the avoidance of doubt, after the 2014 Annual Meeting) as the Chief Executive Officer, Chairman of the Board and a director of the Company during the selection process for the New CEO until the Board shall appoint the New CEO, which shall not be later than the earlier of December 31, 2014, or Mr. Koffel's voluntary resignation from such positions; provided that Mr. Koffel will resign as a director of the Company and the Chairman of the Board upon the effectiveness of the Board's appointment of the New CEO; provided, further, that nothing contained herein is intended to modify any employment agreement, equity award, retirement plan or other pre-existing obligation of the Company to Martin Koffel or to impose any additional obligations on Martin Koffel (beyond the obligation to resign as provided in this Section 4(b)). The Board shall appoint the New CEO as a director of the Company with a term expiring at the Company's next annual meeting after his or her appointment.

5. Compensation Committee. At the March Board Meeting, the Company shall appoint one JANA Nominee chosen by JANA (provided that such JANA Nominee must have prior experience serving on the Compensation Committee of a public company incorporated in the United States and listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ) to the Compensation Committee of the Board (the "Compensation Committee"), and shall not otherwise increase the size of the Compensation Committee until the 2015 Annual Meeting. In the event of the replacement as set forth in Section 3(c) of any JANA Nominee appointed to the Compensation Committee pursuant to this Section 5, his or her successor shall be promptly appointed to the committee seat vacated by such former director to serve until the 2015 Annual Meeting. The Compensation Committee and any other committee currently or in the future designated to review or oversee compensation shall not take any material action prior to the March Board Meeting.

6. Value Creation Committee and Other Matters.

(a) At the March Board Meeting, the Board shall establish a new committee of the Board (the "Value Creation Committee"), whose purpose will be to evaluate all options for enhancing shareholder value, including by (i) engaging Bank of America Merrill Lynch, or if Bank of America Merrill Lynch is unavailable or the Company is unable to reach acceptable terms with Merrill Lynch Bank of America despite using reasonable best efforts to do so, another investment bank mutually agreeable to the Company and JANA, as promptly as practicable, to review all options for enhancing value, including by conducting a strategic review of the Company's business, operations and capital







  structure; (ii) engaging a cost consultant, mutually agreeable to the Company and JANA, to conduct a cost review commencing with the completion of the investment banker review described in clause (ii) above; and (iii) reviewing the Company's management compensation structure to enhance alignment with shareholder value creation. There shall be four (4) members of the Value Creation Committee, two (2) of whom shall be JANA Nominees chosen by JANA, and the Board shall not increase the size of the Value Creation Committee until the 2015 Annual Meeting, if still in existence at such time.

URS CORPORATION ADDS FOUR NEW INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS TO BOARD   JANA Partners Agrees to Support All Nominees at 2014 Annual Meeting   Board to Establish Value Creation Committee

  SAN FRANCISCO, CA - March [XX], 2014 - URS Corporation (NYSE: URS) today announced that it will add four new independent directors to its Board of Directors, effective March 27, 2014. These four directors will be on URS' slate of directors nominated for election to the Board of Directors at the Company's 2014 Annual Meeting, along with eight incumbents, pursuant to an agreement with JANA Partners LLC. The four new directors will be: Diane C. Creel, William H. Schumann, III,

David N. Siegel and V. Paul Unruh. Biographical information on the new directors is provided below.

Current directors [A] and [B] have advised the Company that they do not plan to stand for re-election at the 2014

Annual Meeting. Therefore, from March 27, 2014 until the Annual Meeting, the Board will increase to fourteen members from the

current ten, but will be comprised of twelve directors following the 2014 Annual Meeting.

Under the agreement with JANA, URS will also form a Value Creation Committee of the Board that will evaluate all

options for enhancing shareholder value, including by engaging an investment bank to conduct a strategic review of the

Company's business segments, operations and capital structure, and reviewing the Company's management compensation structure to enhance alignment with shareholder value creation. The Committee will be comprised of four members, two of whom

will be new directors.

Martin M. Koffel, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of URS, stated: "[A] and [B] are superb directors and have contributed much to our success, but each has decided for his own reasons not to stand for re-election. I and their fellow board

members look forward to continuing to work with them until the Annual Meeting but will take this opportunity to express our

gratitude for their service, sound counsel and friendship." Koffel continued: "With [A]'s and [B]'s decisions to stand down and the expansion of our Board, we are adding four new, highly qualified independent directors to the Board on March 27 and we will nominate these directors for election at the

2014 Annual Meeting. All are accomplished business leaders with experience





  relevant to the URS enterprise, and we are confident that they will prove to be valuable additions as we continue working to build

value for our stockholders." As previously disclosed, the URS Board has been engaged in succession planning for the Company's Chief Executive Officer position and has appointed a CEO Succession Committee comprised of independent directors. Two of the new directors

will promptly be appointed to this Committee. One of the new directors will also be appointed to the Compensation Committee.

Said Koffel, "Having led URS for more than 25 years, I had previously communicated to the Board that it was important to have my successor in place in 2014, and our goal is to do just that. The Board has asked me to remain as Chairman and Chief

Executive Officer until a successor is named, which I expect to do unless circumstances change." Barry Rosenstein, Managing Partner of JANA Partners, said, "We have appreciated our constructive dialogue with Martin Koffel and his team. We share their view that the Company is significantly undervalued, particularly given its strong cash

flows and the valuable work Martin and his team have done over many years to ensure that URS is well-positioned to meet the

needs of its clients. I am confident that the addition of four highly-qualified directors and the formation of the Value Creation

Committee will help unlock this value for all shareholders." JANA Partners currently owns approximately 9.7 percent of the Company's common shares outstanding. URS' incumbent directors expected to be nominated for reÂ­election at the 2014 Annual Meeting are: [C]; [D]; [E]; [F]; [G]; [H]; [I]; and [J].

The director nominations will be included in the Company's 2014 proxy statement and submitted for stockholder approval at the Company's 2014 Annual Meeting, [to be held on [date]]. The Company expects to file its proxy materials for the

2014 Annual Meeting [in the near future] and encourages stockholders to review the proxy materials when they become available.

The agreement between URS and JANA Partners will be filed on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange

Commission. The agreement includes certain standstill restrictions that will be in effect until 30 days prior to the deadline by which

a shareholder must give notice to the Company of its intention to nominate a director at or bring other business before the 2015

Annual Meeting. JANA Partners has committed to





  vote the shares that it controls in support of URS' twelve director nominees at the Company's 2014 Annual Meeting. Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and Cooley LLP are serving as legal advisors to URS.
