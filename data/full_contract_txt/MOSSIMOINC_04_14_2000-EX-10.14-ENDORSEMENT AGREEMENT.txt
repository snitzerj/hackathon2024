Company agrees that it will reimburse Licensor for all reasonable travel, lodging and meal expenses incurred by Licensor or Duval in connection with such

         11. DEFAULT. (a) If either party at any time during the Contract Period shall (i) fail to make any payment of any sum of money herein specified to be made, or (ii) fail to observe or&bbsp;perform any of the covenants, agreements or obligations hereunder (other than the payment of money), the nondefaulting party may terminate this Agreement as follows: as to (i) if such payment is not made within ten (10) days after the defaulting party shall have received written notice of such failure to make payment, or as to (ii) if such default is not cured within thirty (30) days after the defaulting party shall have received written notice specifying in reasonable detail the nature of such default. In order to be a sufficient notice hereunder, any such written notice shall specify in detail each item of default and shall specify the provision of this Agreement which applies to each item of default, and shall specify in detail the action the defaulting party is required to take in order to cure each item of default.

         14. RESERVATION OF RIGHTS. All rights not herein specifically granted to Company shall remain the property of Licensor to be used in any manner Licensor deems appropriate.

         16. SPECIAL RIGHT OF TERMINATION. Company shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon written notice to Licensor if the commercial value of the Duval Identification is substantially reduced because Duval (i) has engaged in illegal or immoral conduct resulting in a felony conviction; or (ii) fails an officially sanctioned drug test or is criminally convicted of any drug related offense. Any termination pursuant to this paragraph shall become effective on the 30th day next following the date of receipt by Licensor of Company's written notice to so terminate.

                                      -6-

         17. LIMITED LIABILITY. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in the event Company incurs any expenses, damages or other liabilities (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees) in connection with the performance or non-performance of any term or provision hereof, Licensor's liability to Company shall not exceed the remuneration, excluding reimbursement of expenses, actually paid to Licensor by Company. In no event will Licensor be liable for any indirect, incidental, reliance, special or consequential damages arising out of the performance or non-performance of this Agreement, whether or not Licensor had been advised of the possibility of such damages. It is understood that Duval is not a party hereto and has no liability hereunder but is an intended specific third party creditor beneficiary hereof.

         18. WAIVER. The failure of either party at any time or times to demand strict performance by the other of any of the terms, covenants or conditions set forth herein shall not be construed as a continuing waiver or relinquishment thereof and each may at any time demand strict and complete performance by the other of said terms, covenants and conditions. Any waiver of such rights must be set forth in writing.

         19. SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Agreement shall be declared illegal, invalid, void or unenforceable by any judicial or administrative authority, the validity of any other provision and of the entire Agreement shall not be affected thereby.

         20. ASSIGNMENT. This Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of Licensor, and the successors and assigns of Licensor. The rights granted Company hereunder are personal to it, shall be used only by it or its affiliate and shall not without the prior written consent of Licensor be transferred or assigned to any other party. In the event of the merger or consolidation of Company with any other entity, Licensor shall have the right to terminate the Contract Period by so notifying Company in writing within sixty (60) days following Licensor's receipt of notice of such merger or consolidation.

         21. ARBITRATION/GOVERNING LAW. This agreement shall be governed by, and its provisions enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of Ohio, without regard to its principals of conflicts of laws.

All such arbitration shall take place at the office





of the American Arbitration Association located in Cleveland, Ohio.
