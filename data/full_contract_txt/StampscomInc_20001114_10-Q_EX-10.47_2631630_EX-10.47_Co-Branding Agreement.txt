         (i)   Either party may, at its option, terminate this Agreement upon notice to the other party if (A) the other party materially fails to comply with any of the material terms and conditions of this Agreement and (B) if such default has not been cured within thirty (30) days (forty five (45) days if required by the nature of the breach) after written notice to the other party or, if such breach is not curable within thirty (30) days (forty five (45) days if required by the nature of the breach), reasonable efforts and progress are not being made to cure such breach.

         (ii)  This Agreement shall terminate, without notice, (A) upon the institution by or against either party of insolvency, receivership or bankruptcy proceedings or any other proceedings for the settlement of such party's debts, (B) upon either party's making an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or (C) upon either party's dissolution or ceasing to do business.

     (c) Termination Period.          ------------------

         (i)   If this Agreement is terminated or expires in accordance with this Section 15 (other than termination by the Company in the event of an uncured material breach by MBE), then MBE shall have a period of up to twenty-four (24) months from and after the date of such termination, to make arrangements with respect to the conversion of the Service to a non-Company manifest system (the "Termination Period"). The date when the Service shall have                       ------------------ been converted to a non-Company manifest system shall hereinafter be referred to as the "Termination Completion Date" and shall be the effective date of          -------------------------- termination of this Agreement, in such event. During the Termination Period each party will continue to perform its obligations hereunder, and MBE and MBE Centers will continue to pay any applicable fees and payments hereunder to the Company. MBE shall keep the Company informed as reasonably necessary with respect to such conversion. MBE also shall give the Company written notice of the estimated Termination Completion Date promptly after a reasonably definitive projected Termination Completion Date is known by MBE, and shall give written notice to the Company promptly after any change in such estimated Termination Completion Date.

         (ii)  During the Termination Period, the Company will give reasonable cooperation and support to MBE to assure an orderly and efficient transition and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, at MBE's expense, the Company shall be obligated to provide MBE with data reasonably necessary for MBE to convert or implement the non-Company systems, procedures and practices.

each party shall, at its own expense, destroy or return to the Company and make no further use of, any property, materials or other items of the other party and shall certify, in writing that it has done so

         (iii) Nothing contained herein shall limit any other remedies that either party may have for the default of the other party under this Agreement nor relieve either party of any of their obligations incurred prior to termination of this Agreement.

         (iv)  During the Termination Period and thereafter, and notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, MBE will be free to use its own personnel, and/or engage or contract with any third party to use the Specifications to design, develop and market an Internet-based manifest system similar to the Manifest (including products that contain functionality similar to the Service and which have a "look and feel" similar or identical to the Manifest), in each case solely for the benefit of MBE and the MBE Centers and international franchisees or licensees of MBE. MBE shall not use the object code or source code of the Manifest in the course of such development. Subject to MBE's compliance with the provisions of this subsection (iv), the Company shall not

                                      -18-

assert any claim against MBE under the Company's Intellectual Property Rights in the Specifications or the Manifest in connection with such development, other than for use of the Company's trademarks, trade names, service marks and service names.

If a force majeure event causes the Company to allocate limited resources among all of its customers, [***]*.                                                                        --- The Company shall resume operation of the Service as soon as reasonably practicable upon conclusion of any force majeure event.
