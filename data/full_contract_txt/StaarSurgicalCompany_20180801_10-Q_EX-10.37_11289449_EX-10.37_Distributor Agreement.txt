9. Warranty and Quality Control 9.1 STAAR warrants that, for the period of twelve (12) months from the date of delivery to Distributor hereunder (the "Warranty Period"), the Products will meet STAAR's published specifications or labeling for such Products as in effect at the time of such delivery ("Warranty"). To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law and except as otherwise stated in this Agreement: (a) the foregoing Warranty is exclusive; and (b) all other terms, representations, undertakings, rights, remedies and warranties are excluded, whether express or implied (including but not limited to any warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose or against infringement). To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the exclusive remedy for breach of the Warranty shall be, at STAAR's option, the repair or replacement, at STAAR's expense, of the non-conforming Product; provided that Distributor notifies STAAR of the non-conformity and returns the non-conforming Product within the Warranty Period. Products may only be returned by Distributor when accompanied by a return material authorization number issued by STAAR. Shipping expenses for Products returned by Distributor will be prepaid by Distributor. STAAR shall pay for the return or replacement shipment to Distributor of Products repaired or replaced under the Warranty. For Products returned for repair or replacement that are not covered under Warranty, STAAR's standard repair charges shall be applicable in addition to all shipping expenses. The above Warranty is contingent upon proper installation, use and maintenance of the Products and does not apply to Products which have been misused, mishandled, adulterated, repaired or modified without STAAR's written approval. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, STAAR shall not be responsible for any incidental or consequential loss, damage, or expense which arises directly or indirectly from the use of any Product. Without limiting the above, and to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Distributor's sole remedy in contract or in tort (including in negligence) and STAAR's liability shall be limited to the repair or replacement of any Product which is returned to and found to be defective or non-conforming by STAAR. 9.2 Distributor shall not make any representation or warranty as to the Products except for the warranty stated in Section 9.1 above. Distributor shall not alter the Products and shall not recommend or knowingly sell the Products for any uses except as described in STAAR's Product label and labeling and in accordance with the written instructions and warnings furnished by STAAR. Distributor agrees to deliver to its customers at or before sale all specifications, inserts, instructions, and warnings furnished by STAAR and to retain records evidencing such delivery. 10. Regulatory and Post-Market Surveillance Requirements 10.1 During the term of this Agreement and for at least ten (10) years thereafter, Distributor shall maintain records to allow for traceability of individual serial/lot numbers to customers for all sales of the Products. Upon request by STAAR, Distributor shall supply STAAR with a report of the information contained in such records. 10.2 In the event that STAAR deems it necessary to recall any Product, or any governmental authority requests recall of any Product distributed or sold by Distributor in the Territory, Distributor and STAAR shall cooperate fully with each other in effecting such recall, with an effort to reduce as much as possible the expense thereof and Distributor must notify STAAR of any contemplated or requested recalls as soon as possible (and at all times within any period required to notify any regulatory authority under applicable law) and prior to Distributor taking any steps to effect such a recall. Without limiting Distributor's obligations under law, as between Distributor and STAAR, the decision of whether or not to recall any Product shall be made solely by STAAR. Distributor shall notify all customers who received the recalled Product and shall record all receipts of Product returned under any recall. Distributor shall maintain copies of recall notification letters and maintain distribution logs that detail where each Product was shipped by Distributor.

Distributor shall respect such property rights of STAAR and comply with all local laws and regulations in respect thereof. Distributor shall also assist STAAR, at STAAR's request, in taking any steps necessary to defend such rights, and any reasonable expenses incurred in this regard by Distributor shall be reimbursed by STAAR. 11.3 Distributor shall at all times keep STAAR apprised of all Regulatory Requirements and any changes thereto and, on an annual basis, shall report to STAAR in writing of any such changes and confirm in such report that there have been no changes in any Regulatory Requirements other than as specified in the annual report. 11.4 Copies of all permits, licenses, sponsorships and registrations referred in Sections 11.1 and 11.2 shall be promptly forwarded to STAAR. 12.
