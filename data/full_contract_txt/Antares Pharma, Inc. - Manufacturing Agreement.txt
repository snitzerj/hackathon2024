(iii) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, AMAG acknowledges and agrees that Antares shall only be responsible for producing and delivering to AMAG that portion (up to the entire quantity) of Products and sample Products requested pursuant to a Purchase Order for which Antares or its Subcontractor (as the case may be) possesses, at least [***] prior to the Delivery Date, a sufficient stock of inventory of Prefilled Syringes necessary to

(iv) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, AMAG acknowledges and agrees that Antares shall not be responsible for delay in the delivery of quantity of Products, sample Products or Trainers (as the case may be) set forth in any Firm Order to the extent such delay is caused primarily due to AMAG's failure to fulfill the AMAG Quality Tasks to enable Antares and/or its Subcontractor to timely perform the Manufacturing Services.
