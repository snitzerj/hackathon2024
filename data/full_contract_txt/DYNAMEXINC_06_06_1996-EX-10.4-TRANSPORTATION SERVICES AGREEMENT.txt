6.3    A party shall, for any loss, damage or delay to Freight while in its        care, custody or control, forthwith pay to the other Party the actual        damages suffered by such other Party. Such liability shall not exceed the        other Party's contractual liability to its customers. The Parties        acknowledge that their contract of carriage with their customers provides        that liability for loss, damage or delay, including liability for        consequential loss, is limited to Four Dollars and Forty One Cents        ($4.41) per kilogram or Two Dollars ($2.00) per pound unless a higher        value has been declared for insurance purposes.

Loss or damage sustained by the        indemnifying Party shall also include loss as a result of loss of use.

9                                      - 9 -

13.0   DANGEROUS GOODS

13.1   The Parties acknowledge that the Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act,        S.C. 1992, c.34, as amended from time to time (hereinafter referred        to as the "TDGA") prohibits transportation of any explosive, dangerous         or destructive substance, or anything likely to injure or damage property        or persons (hereinafter referred to as "Dangerous Goods") unless the        requirements of the TDGA are met. The Parties agree that they only intend        for Dangerous Goods to be carried pursuant to this Agreement if the        requirements of the TDGA are met and both Parties are aware that such        goods are being carried. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties agree        that neither Dynamex nor Purolator shall be under any obligation or duty        whatsoever to open for prior inspection any Freight tendered to Dynamex        pursuant to this Agreement. Neither Party shall be responsible for any        losses or damage whatsoever that may be sustained by the other Party, its        directors, officers, employees and any persons for whom it may become        responsible in law, as a result of any Dangerous Goods contained in        Freight unless such Party had actual prior knowledge of the presence of        Dangerous Goods. In the event a Party had actual prior knowledge of the        presence of Dangerous Goods, then it shall be liable for loss or damage        to the other Party if it would otherwise be liable under this Agreement        or at law.

13.2   Each Party must comply with the placarding and all other regulations        applicable to the handling of Dangerous Goods. The Parties agree to        maintain at their own expense a current Dangerous Goods Training        Certificate for both air and ground shipments for itself and its        operators during the term of this Agreement and to provide the other        Party with a copy of same upon execution of the Agreement and thereafter,        as the Parties request, failure of which may result in the termination of        this Agreement immediately by the other Party.

13.3   The Parties agree to ensure that their respective Dangerous Goods        Handling Procedures are compatible to ensure complete adherence with the        Legislation and Regulations. Each Party agrees to promptly advise the        other of any changes to its Dangerous Goods Handling Procedures.

14.0   RECORDS AND REPORTS    14.1   Each Party shall maintain performance reports, comparing actual to        scheduled departure and arrival times for Services provided. Such        reports shall be made available for review by the other Party and in        connection with same, a Party shall provide copies of all data and        records relating thereto.

14.2   Each Party shall maintain complete maintenance and operational records.

14.3   Each Party shall keep accurate books, accounts and records covering all         transactions relating to this Agreement, including books of original        entry, and upon request from the other Party, shall allow access to        same.

14.4   Either Party shall have the right to request the other to provide,        through an auditor agreed to by the Parties, validation of the        information and data referred to herein.

15.0   CONTINGENCY PLANS

15.1   In the event a Party is unable to provide the Services as a result of a        strike or other labour disruption caused by its employees, it shall              attempt to subcontract the Services to another operator or operators,        acceptable to the other Party. Such Services shall be provided by such        subcontractor/subcontractors on the same terms and conditions herein set        out and will be continued to be provided during the period of any such        strike or labour disruption, unless this Agreement is otherwise        terminated pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement. It is        understood and agreed that, if such Party provides the Services by        subcontracting to another operator/operators, then it shall be deemed        not to be in default pursuant to paragraph 17.1(c). Notwithstanding        same, all other default provisions as set out in paragraph 17, continue        to apply.





16.0   SERVICE FAILURE REMEDIES

     (e)     if a judgment or order is entered with respect to it under the                 Company Creditors Arrangement Act R.S.C. 1985, Chapter C-36, as                 amended, or similar legislation, or it takes advantage of the                 provisions of any bankruptcy or insolvency legislation;

     (f)     if any execution, or any other process of any court becomes                 enforceable against all or substantially all of it's property or                 if a distress or analogous process is levied against all or                 substantially all of its property;

     (g)     if it is in default as per paragraph 16.1 hereof; or

     (h)     if it otherwise neglects or fails to perform or observe any of                 its obligations under this Agreement and fails to cure the                 breach or default within thirty (30) days of written notice to                 the other Party.

17.2    Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default and in addition to any         rights or remedies available to it under this Agreement or at law or in         equity, the Party not in default may exercise any or all of the         following remedies:

     (a)     terminate this Agreement, upon giving one hundred and twenty                 (120) days written notice, otherwise upon written notice with                 respect to 17.1 (g) and (h);

     (c)     take possession, immediately, without demand or notice, without                 any court order or other process of law, any and all of its                 property (including bags and containers) and Freight received by                 the defaulting Party under this Agreement.

17.3    Termination of this Agreement shall be without prejudice to any other         rights of the Party not in default, including the right to claim         damages, and to the rights of the Parties that have accrued prior to         termination.

17.4    In the event the Defaulting Party fails to pay any amount due pursuant         to paragraph 17.2, then the other Party shall have the right to deduct         same from any amount due or to become due to the defaulting Party.    13                                      - 13 -

18.0    PERFORMANCE PENALTIES

18.1    In the event a Party has, in any twelve (12) month period, more than         three (3) Monthly Performance Failures, then the defaulting Party shall         pay a penalty to the Party not in default, which the Parties acknowledge         is a pre-estimation of damages suffered by the non-defaulting Party due         to the current month's Monthly Performance Failure ("Default Month").

     For each Default Month, the Party in default shall pay a penalty equal         to five (5) times the Party not in default's corporate average yield         during the Default Month for each shipment below the performance





     commitment.

     For example, if the defaulting Party, in a Default Month, provided         services at an eighty five percent (85%) level and the average yield for         the Default Month of the Party not in default is ten dollars ($10.00)         and the total number of shipments handled by the defaulting Party         pursuant to this Agreement is one hundred (100), then the penalty would         be equal to 5 x[(Performance Commitment - Actual Performance Level) x #         of shipments] x average yield or 5 x [(90-85) x 100] x 10 = $250.00.                                       100 19.0    TERMINATION WITHOUT CAUSE

19.1    Either Party may terminate this Agreement, without cause, by giving two         (2) years written notice.

19.2    In the event of a change in control of a Party, the other Party shall         have the right, upon written prior notice, to terminate this          Agreement.
