Charles Webb & Company, a Division of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc. 211 Bradenton Avenue Dublin, Ohio 43017

Ladies and Gentlemen:

         Alamogordo   Financial   Corporation,   a  federal   corporation   (the "Company"), AF Mutual Holding Company (the "MHC") and Alamogordo Federal Savings and Loan Association,  a federally  chartered stock savings and loan association (the  "Bank")  with its  deposit  accounts  insured by the  Savings  Association Insurance  Fund  ("SAIF")   administered  by  the  Federal   Deposit   Insurance Corporation  ("FDIC"),  hereby confirm,  jointly and severally,  their agreement with Charles Webb & Company,  a Division of Keefe,  Bruyette & Woods,  Inc. (the "Agent"), as follows:

         Section 1. The  Offering.  In accordance  with the Stock  Issuance Plan adopted by its Board of Directors (the "Plan"),  the Company will offer and sell up to  1,101,643  shares of its common  stock,  par  value,  $.01 per share (the "Shares" or "Common  Stock"),  in a  subscription  offering  (the  "Subscription Offering") to (1) depositors of the Bank with account balances of $50.00 or more as of September 30, 1998 ("Eligible  Account  Holders"),  (2) the Employee Stock Ownership Plan of the Bank (the "ESOP"), (3) depositors of the Bank with account balances  of $50.00 or more as of  December  31,  1999  ("Supplemental  Eligible Account Holders"), and (4) employees, officers and directors of the Bank. To the extent  Shares  remain  unsold in the  Subscription  Offering,  the  Company  is offering for sale in a community  offering  (the  "Community  Offering" and when referred to together  with the  Subscription  Offering,  the  "Subscription  and Community  Offering")  the  Shares  not  so  subscribed  for or  ordered  in the Subscription Offering to members of the general public, with preference given to natural persons residing in the New Mexico counties of Otero and Lincoln

("Other Subscribers"),  (all such offerees being referred to in the aggregate as "Eligible  Offerees").  It is anticipated  that shares not subscribed for in the Subscription  and Community  Offering will be offered to certain  members of the general  public on a best efforts basis through a selected  dealers  arrangement (the "Syndicated  Community  Offering") (the  Subscription  Offering,  Community Offering and Syndicated  Community Offering are collectively  referred to as the "Offering").  It is acknowledged  that the purchase of Shares in the Offering is subject to the maximum and minimum purchase limitations as described in the Plan and that the Company and the Bank may  reject,  in whole or in part,  any orders received in the Community Offering or Syndicated Community Offering. The Company will  issue the Shares at a  purchase  price of $10.00 per share (the  "Purchase Price").

         The Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange  Commission (the "Commission")  a  registration  statement  on Form  S-1  (File  No.  333- ) (the "Registration  Statement")  containing a prospectus relating to the Offering for the  registration  of the  Shares  under the  Securities  Act of 1933 (the "1933 Act"),  and has filed such amendments  thereof and such amended  prospectuses as may have been  required to the date hereof.  The term  "Registration  Statement" shall  include  all  exhibits  thereto,  as  amended,  including  post-effective amendments.  The prospectus, as amended, on file with the Commission at the time the Registration  Statement initially became effective is hereinafter called the "Prospectus,"  except that if any Prospectus is filed by the Company pursuant to Rule 424(b) or (c) of the rules and regulations of the Commission under the 1933 Act (the "1933 Act  Regulations")  differing  from the prospectus on file at the time  the  Registration   Statement   initially  becomes  effective,   the  term "Prospectus"  shall refer to the prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) or (c) from and after the time said prospectus is filed with the Commission.

         In accordance  with Title 12, Parts 575 and 563b of the Code of Federal Regulations  (the "MHC  Regulations"),  the Company has filed with the Office of Thrift  Supervision (the "OTS") an Application on Form MHC-2 with respect to the stock  issuance  (the  "MHC  Application"),  including  the  Prospectus  and the Valuation  Appraisal Report prepared by RP Financial,  LC (the  "Appraisal") and has filed such amendments  thereto as may have been required by the OTS. The MHC Application  has been  approved by the OTS and the related  Prospectus  has been authorized for use by the OTS.





         Section 2. Retention of Agent;  Compensation;  Sale and Delivery of the Shares.  Subject to the terms and conditions  herein set forth,  the Company and the Bank have retained the Agent to consult with and to advise the Bank, the MHC and the Company,  and to assist the Company,  on a best  efforts  basis,  in the distribution  of the shares of Common Stock in the  Offering.  The services that the  Agent  will  provide  include,  but are not  limited  to (i)  training  the employees  of the Bank who will  perform  certain  ministerial  functions in the Subscription  and Community  Offering  regarding  the  mechanics and  regulatory requirements of the stock offering process,  (ii) managing the Stock Information Center by assisting  interested stock  subscribers and by keeping records of all stock orders and (iii) preparing marketing materials.

                                        2

         On the basis of the representations,  warranties, and agreements herein contained,  but subject to the terms and conditions  herein set forth, the Agent accepts such appointment and agrees to consult with and advise the Company,  the MHC and the Bank as to the  matters set forth in the letter  agreement  ("Letter Agreement"),  dated  November 29, 1999 between the Company and the Agent (a copy of which is attached  hereto as Exhibit A). It is  acknowledged  by the Company, the MHC and the Bank that the Agent  shall not be  required  to take or purchase any Shares or be  obligated to take any action  which is  inconsistent  with all applicable laws, regulations, decisions or orders.

         The  obligations of the Agent  pursuant to this  Agreement  (other than those set forth in  Sections  2(d),  8 and 9 hereof)  shall  terminate  upon the completion  or  termination  or  abandonment  of the Plan by the Company or upon termination  of the  Offering,  but in no event  later  than the date  (the "End Date") which is 45 days after the Closing  Date (as  hereinafter  defined).  All fees or  expenses  due to the Agent but  unpaid  will be payable to the Agent in next day funds at the earlier of the Closing  Date (as  hereinafter  defined) or the End Date.  In the event the  Offering is extended  beyond the End Date,  the Company, the MHC, the Bank and the Agent may agree to renew this Agreement under mutually acceptable terms.

         In the event the Company is unable to sell a minimum of 708,050  Shares within the period  herein  provided,  this  Agreement  shall  terminate  and the Company shall refund to any persons who have  subscribed  for any of the Shares, the full amount which it may have  received  from them plus accrued  interest as set forth in the  Prospectus;  and none of the parties to this  Agreement  shall have any obligation to the other parties hereunder,  except as set forth in this Section 2 and in Sections 6, 8 and 9 hereof.

         In the event the Offering is terminated,  the Agent shall be reimbursed for its actual accountable out-of-pocket expenses.

         If all  conditions  precedent  to  the  consummation  of the  Offering, including, without limitation, the sale of all Shares required by the Plan to be sold, are satisfied,  the Company  agrees to issue,  or have issued,  the Shares sold in the Offering and to release for delivery certificates for such Shares on the Closing Date (as hereinafter  defined) against payment to the Company by any means authorized by the Plan; provided, however, that no funds shall be released to the Company  until the  conditions  specified  in Section 7 hereof shall have been  complied  with to the  reasonable  satisfaction  of the  Agent  and  their counsel.  The release of Shares against payment therefor shall be made on a date and at a place  acceptable  to the  Company,  the MHC,  the Bank and the  Agent. Certificates  for  shares  shall be  delivered  directly  to the  purchasers  in accordance with their directions.  The date upon which the Company shall release or deliver the Shares sold in the Offering, in accordance with the terms herein, is called the "Closing Date."

         The Agent shall  receive the  following  compensation  for its services hereunder:

                                        3

          (a)  A  management  fee of $25,000,  payable in four  installments  of                $6,250 on  November 29 and  December  29, 1999 and January 29 and                February 29,  2000.  Should the  Offering be  terminated  for any                reason not  attributable  to the action or inaction of the Agent,                the Agent  shall  have  earned  and be  entitled  to be paid fees                accruing through the stage at which the termination occurred.

          (b)  A Success Fee of $75,000.

          (c)  If any of the shares remain  available after the Subscription and                Community  Offerings,  at the request of the Bank, the Agent will                seek to form a syndicate of registered  broker-dealers  to assist                in the sale of such Common Stock on a best efforts basis, subject                to the terms and  conditions  set forth in the  selected  dealers                agreement. the Agent will endeavor to distribute the Common Stock                among  dealers in a fashion  which  best  meets the  distribution                objectives of the Bank and the Plan. the Agent will be paid a fee                not to exceed 5.5% of the aggregate  Purchase Price of the Shares                sold by them.  the Agent will pass onto selected  broker-dealers,





               who assist in the  syndicated  community,  an amount  competitive                with  gross  underwriting  discounts  changed  at such  time  for                comparable  amounts of stock sold at a comparable price per share                in a similar market  environment.  Fees with respect to purchases                affected with the  assistance of a  broker/dealer  other than the                Agent shall be  transmitted  by the Agent to such  broker/dealer.                The decision to utilize selected  broker-dealers  will be made by                the Bank upon  consultation  with the Agent.  In the event,  with                respect to any  purchases  of Shares,  fees are paid  pursuant to                this subparagraph 2(c), such fees shall be in lieu of, and not in                addition to, payment pursuant to subparagraph 2(a) and 2(b).

          (d)  The Company  will bear those  expenses of the  proposed  offering                customarily  borne by  issuers,  including,  without  limitation,                regulatory   filing  fees,   "Blue  Sky,"  and  NASD  filing  and                registration  fees;  the  fees  of  the  Company's   accountants,                attorneys,  appraiser,  transfer agent and  registrar,  printing,                mailing and marketing and syndicate expenses  associated with the                Offering;  the fees set  forth in  Section  2; and fees for "Blue                Sky" legal work.  If the Agent  incurs  expenses on behalf of the                Company, the Company will reimburse the Agent for such expenses.

               The  Agent  shall  be  reimbursed  for  reasonable  out-of-pocket                expenses,   including   costs  of  travel,   meals  and  lodging,                photocopying,  telephone, facsimile and couriers. The Agent shall                also  be  reimbursed  for  its  fees  of  underwriter's   counsel                (including  counsel's   out-of-pocket  expenses)  not  to  exceed                $35,000.

          (b)  The MHC  Application  which was prepared by the Company,  the MHC                and the Bank and filed  with the OTS was  approved  by the OTS on                ___________  ___,  2000,  and the  related  Prospectus  has  been                authorized for use by the OTS.

          (f)  The MHC does not own any equity securities or any equity interest                in any business enterprise except as described in the Prospectus.

          (g)  The MHC is not authorized to issue any shares of capital stock.

          (h)  At the  Closing  Date,  the Plan will have  been  adopted  by the                Boards  of  Directors  of the  Company,  the MHC and the Bank and                approved  by the  members of the Bank,  and the offer and sale of                the Shares will have been  conducted in all material  respects in                accordance  with the  Plan,  the MHC  Regulations,  and all other                applicable laws, regulations, decisions and orders, including all                terms,  conditions,  requirements and provisions precedent to the                Offering  imposed  upon the  Company,  the MHC or the Bank by the                OTS, the Commission, or any other regulatory authority and in the                manner  described  in the  Prospectus.  No person  has  sought to                obtain  review of the final  action of the OTS in  approving  the                Plan or in approving the MHC Application, or any other statute or                regulation.

          (i)  The Bank has been organized and is a validly  existing  federally                chartered  savings and loan  association in capital stock form of                organization, duly authorized to conduct its business and own its                property  as  described  in the  Registration  Statement  and the                Prospectus;  the Bank has obtained all material licenses, permits                and other governmental  authorizations currently required for the                conduct  of  its  business;   all  such  licenses,   permits  and                governmental authorizations are in full force and effect, and the                Bank is in all material respects  complying with all laws, rules,                regulations  and  orders  applicable  to  the  operation  of  its                business;  the Bank is  existing  under  the  laws of the  United                States and is duly qualified as a foreign corporation to transact                business and is in good  standing in each  jurisdiction  in which                its  ownership  of property or leasing of property or the conduct                of its business requires such  qualification,  unless the failure                to be so qualified in one or more of such jurisdictions would not                have a material  adverse  effect on the  condition,  financial or                otherwise, or the business, operations or income of the Bank. The

               MHC  Application  without  providing the Agent and its counsel an                opportunity  to review such  amendment or  supplement or file any                amendment or  supplement  to which  amendment or  supplement  the                Agent or its counsel shall reasonably object.

          (c)  The Company,  the MHC and the Bank will use their best efforts to                cause any post-effective  amendment to the Registration Statement                to be declared effective by the Commission and any post-effective                amendment  to the MHC  Application  to be approved by the OTS and                will immediately  upon receipt of any information  concerning the                events listed below notify the Agent:  (i) when the  Registration                Statement,  as amended,  has become effective;  (ii) when the MHC                Application,  as amended has been approved by the OTS;  (iii) any                comments from the Commission,  the OTS or any other  governmental                entity  with  respect  to  the   Offering  or  the   transactions                contemplated  by  this  Agreement;  (iv)  of the  request  by the                Commission,  the OTS or any  other  governmental  entity  for any                amendment or supplement to the  Registration  Statement,  the MHC                Application or for additional information; (v) of the issuance by                the Commission,  the OTS or any other governmental  entity of any                order or other action  suspending  the Offering or the use of the                Registration  Statement or the  Prospectus or any other filing of                the Company,  the MHC or the Bank under the MHC  Regulations,  or                other applicable law, or the threat of any such action;  (vi) the                issuance by the Commission,  the OTS or any authority of any stop                order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration  Statement                or of the  initiation  or threat of  initiation  or threat of any                proceedings  for that purpose;  or (vii) of the occurrence of any                event mentioned in paragraph (g) below. The Company,  the MHC and                the Bank will make every  reasonable  effort  (i) to prevent  the                issuance by the Commission, the OTS or any state authority of any                such  order and,  if any such order  shall at any time be issued,                (ii) to obtain the lifting thereof at the earliest possible time.

The Company authorizes the                Agent to use the  Prospectus  (as  amended  or  supplemented,  if                amended or supplemented) in any lawful manner contemplated by the                Plan in connection with the sale of the Shares by the Agent.

          (f)  The  Company,  the MHC and the Bank will  comply with any and all                material  terms,  conditions,  requirements  and provisions  with                respect  to  the  Offering,  and  the  transactions  contemplated                thereby,   imposed  by  the  Commission,   the  OTS  or  the  MHC                Regulations,  and by the 1933 Act, the 1933 Act Regulations,  the                1934 Act and the 1934 Act  Regulations  to be complied with prior                to or subsequent  to the Closing Date and when the  Prospectus is                required  to be  delivered,  and  during  such  time  period  the                Company,  the MHC and the Bank will comply, at their own expense,                with  all  material   requirements   imposed  upon  them  by  the                Commission, the OTS or the MHC Regulations,  and by the 1933 Act,                the  1933  Act  Regulations,  the  1934  Act  and  the  1934  Act                Regulations,  including, without limitation, Rule 10b-5 under the                1934 Act,  in each case as from time to time in force,  so far as                necessary  to permit the  continuance  of sales or dealing in the                Common Stock during such period in accordance with the provisions                hereof and the Prospectus.

          (g)  If, at any time during the period when the Prospectus relating to                the Shares is required to be delivered,  any event relating to or                affecting  the  Company,  the MHC or the Bank shall  occur,  as a                result of which it is necessary or appropriate, in the opinion of                counsel  for  the  Company,  the  MHC  and  the  Bank  or in  the                reasonable opinion of the Agent's counsel, to amend or supplement                the  Registration  Statement or  Prospectus  in order to make the                Registration  Statement or Prospectus  not misleading in light of                the  circumstances   existing  at  the  time  the  Prospectus  is                delivered to a purchaser,  the Company, the MHC and the Bank will                immediately  so inform the Agent and prepare  and file,  at their                own expense,  with the  Commission and the OTS and furnish to the                Agent a reasonable number of copies of an amendment or amendments                of, or a supplement or supplements to, the Registration Statement                or Prospectus (in form and substance  reasonably  satisfactory to                the Agent and its  counsel  after a  reasonable  time for review)                which will amend or  supplement  the  Registration  Statement  or





               Prospectus so that as amended

                                       17

               or  supplemented  it will not  contain an untrue  statement  of a                material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order                to make the  statements  therein,  in light of the  circumstances                existing at the time the  Prospectus is delivered to a purchaser,                not misleading.  For the purpose of this Agreement,  the Company,                the MHC and the Bank each will  timely  furnish to the Agent such                information  with respect to itself as the Agent may from time to                time reasonably request.

          (h)  The  Company,  the MHC and  the  Bank  will  take  all  necessary                actions,  in cooperating  with the Agent, and furnish to whomever                the Agent may  direct,  such  information  as may be  required to                qualify  or  register  the Shares  for  offering  and sale by the                Company or to exempt such Shares from registration,  or to exempt                the Company as a  broker-dealer  and its officers,  directors and                employees  as  broker-dealers  or  agents  under  the  applicable                securities  or blue sky laws of such  jurisdictions  in which the                Shares are required  under the MHC  Regulations  to be sold or as                the Agent and the  Company,  the MHC and the Bank may  reasonably                agree upon;  provided,  however,  that the  Company  shall not be                obligated to file any general  consent to service of process,  to                qualify to do business in any  jurisdiction in which it is not so                qualified,  or to register its  directors or officers as brokers,                dealers,  salesmen  or  agents  in  any  jurisdiction.   In  each                jurisdiction where any of the Shares shall have been qualified or                registered as above provided, the Company will make and file such                statements  and  reports in each  fiscal  period as are or may be                required by the laws of such jurisdiction.

          (i)  The  Company,  the MHC and  the  Bank  will  not  sell or  issue,                contract to sell or otherwise dispose of, for a period of 90 days                after  the  Closing  Date,  without  the  Agent's  prior  written                consent,  any Common Stock other than the Shares or other than in                connection  with  any  plan  or  arrangement   described  in  the                Prospectus, including existing stock benefit plans.

          (j)  The Company  shall  register its Common Stock under Section 12(g)                of the 1934 Act on or prior to the Closing  Date  pursuant to the                Plan and shall request that such  registration be effective prior                to or upon completion of the Offering. The Company shall maintain                the  effectiveness  of such  registration for not less than three                years or such shorter period as may be required by the OTS.

                                       26

               matters  of  law,  summaries  of  legal  matters,   documents  or                proceedings,  or legal  conclusions,  has been  reviewed  by such                counsel and is correct in all material  respects.  The discussion                of  statutes  or  regulations  described  or  referred  to in the                Prospectus   are  accurate   summaries  and  fairly  present  the                information   required  to  be  shown.  The  information  in  the                Prospectus relating to the tax consequences of the stock offering                has been  reviewed  by such  counsel  and  fairly  describes  the                opinions  rendered  by Luse Lehman  Gorman  Pomerenk & Schick and                _____________________  to the Company,  the MHC and the Bank with                respect to such matters.

                    (xxiii) The  Company  and the MHC have been duly  registered                and are in good  standing as savings and loan  holding  companies                under the HOLA.

                    (xxiv) In addition, such counsel shall state that during the                preparation of the MHC Application,  the  Registration  Statement                and the Prospectus, they participated in conferences with certain                officers of, the independent public and internal accountants for,                and other  representatives of the Company,  the MHC and the Bank,                at which  conferences  the contents of the MHC  Application,  the                Registration  Statement and the  Prospectus  and related  matters                were  discussed  and,  while such counsel have not  confirmed the                accuracy or completeness of or otherwise verified the information                contained in the MHC Application,  the Registration  Statement or                the  Prospectus,  and do not assume any  responsibility  for such                information,   based  upon  such  conferences  and  a  review  of                documents deemed relevant for the purpose of rendering their view                (relying as to materiality as to factual  matters on certificates                of officers and other factual representations by the Company, the                MHC and the Bank), nothing has come to their attention that would                lead them to believe that the MHC  Application,  the Registration                Statement, the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto                (other than the  financial  statements,  the notes  thereto,  and                other tabular, financial, statistical and appraisal data included                therein as to which no view need be rendered) contained an untrue                statement of a material  fact or omitted to state a material fact                required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements                therein,  in light of the  circumstances  under  which  they were                made, not misleading.

         In giving such opinion, such counsel may rely as to all matters of fact on  certificates  of officers or directors of the Company,  the MHC and the Bank and certificates of public officials. The opinion of Luse Lehman Gorman Pomerenk & Schick  shall be  governed  by the  Legal  Opinion  Accord  ("Accord")  of the American  Bar  Association  Section of  Business  Law (1991).  The term  "Actual Knowledge"  as used herein  shall have the meaning set forth in the Accord.  For purposes of such opinion, no proceedings shall be deemed to be pending, no order or stop order shall be deemed to be issued,  and no action shall be deemed to be instituted unless, in each case, a director or executive officer of the Company, the MHC or the Bank shall have received a copy of such

                                       27

proceedings,  order,  stop order or action.  In  addition,  such  opinion may be limited to present  statutes,  regulations and judicial  interpretations  and to





facts as they  presently  exist;  in rendering  such opinion,  such counsel need assume no  obligation  to revise or  supplement  it should the  present  laws be changed by legislative or regulatory action, judicial decision or otherwise; and such counsel need express no view, opinion or belief with respect to whether any proposed  or  pending  legislation,  if  enacted,  or any  proposed  or  pending regulations or policy statements issued by any regulatory agency, whether or not promulgated  pursuant to any such legislation,  would affect the validity of the Offering or any aspect  thereof.  Such counsel may assume that any  agreement is the valid and binding obligation of any parties to such agreement other than the Company, the MHC or the Bank.

          (d)  At the Closing Date,  the Agent shall have received the favorable                opinion,  dated as of the  Closing  Date,  of Silver,  Freedman &                Taff, L.L.P.,  the Agent's counsel,  with respect to such matters                as the Agent may reasonably  require.  Such opinion may rely upon                the opinions of counsel to the Company, the MHC and the Bank, and                as  to  matters  of  fact,  upon  certificates  of  officers  and                directors of the Company, the MHC and the Bank delivered pursuant                hereto or as such counsel shall reasonably request.

               or necessary to make the statements  therein, in the light of the                circumstances  under  which they were made,  not  misleading,  or                (iii) arise from any theory of liability  whatsoever  relating to                or arising from or based upon the Registration  Statement (or any                amendment or supplement thereto), preliminary or final Prospectus                (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the MHC Application (or                any amendment or supplement  thereto),or any Blue Sky Application                or  Sales  Information  or  other  documentation  distributed  in                connection with the Offering; provided, however, that the Agent's                obligations  under this Section 8(b) shall exist only if and only                to the extent (i) that such untrue  statement  or alleged  untrue                statement was made in, or such material fact or alleged  material                fact  was  omitted  from,  the  Registration  Statement  (or  any                amendment  or  supplement  thereto),  the  preliminary  or  final                Prospectus  (or any  amendment or  supplement  thereto),  the MHC                Application (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or any Blue                Sky  Application  or Sales  Information  in reliance  upon and in                conformity with information  furnished in writing to the Company,                the MHC or the Bank by the  Agent or its  counsel  regarding  the                Agent,  provided,  that it is agreed and understood that the only                information  furnished in writing to the Company,  the MHC or the                Bank  by the  Agent  regarding  the  Agent  is set  forth  in the                Prospectus.  The  indemnification  provided for in this Section 8                (b) shall not be applicable with respect to any loss,  liability,                claim, damage, or expense whatsoever if it is determined by final                judgment of a court having jurisdiction over the matter that such                loss, liability,  claim, damage or expense was primarily a result                of the Company's,  the MHC's or the Bank's willful  misconduct or                gross negligence.

          (c)  Each  indemnified  party shall give prompt written notice to each                indemnifying  party of any  action,  proceeding,  claim  (whether                commenced  or  threatened),  or  suit  instituted  against  it in                respect of which indemnity may be sought  hereunder,  but failure                to so notify an indemnifying  party shall not relieve it from any                liability  which  it may have on  account  of this  Section  8 or                otherwise.  An  indemnifying  party  may  participate  at its own                expense in the  defense of such  action.  In  addition,  if it so                elects within a reasonable time after receipt of such notice,  an                indemnifying party,  jointly with any other indemnifying  parties                receiving  such  notice,  may assume  defense of such action with                counsel chosen by it and approved by the indemnified parties that                are defendants in such action,  unless such  indemnified  parties                reasonably object to such assumption on the ground that there may                be legal defenses available to them that are different from or in                addition to those  available to such  indemnifying  party.  If an                indemnifying  party  assumes  the  defense  of such  action,  the                indemnifying  parties  shall  not be  liable  for  any  fees  and                expenses  of  counsel  for  the  indemnified   parties   incurred                thereafter in connection  with such action,  proceeding or claim,                other than reasonable costs

                                       35

               of investigation.  In no event shall the indemnifying  parties be                liable for the fees and expenses of more than one  separate  firm                of attorneys (and any special  counsel that said firm may retain)                for each  indemnified  party in  connection  with any one action,                proceeding  or claim or separate but similar or related  actions,                proceedings or claims in the same jurisdiction arising out of the                same general allegations or circumstances.

          (d)  The  agreements  contained  in this  Section  8 and in  Section 9                hereof and the representations and warranties of the Company, the                MHC  and the  Bank  set  forth  in this  Agreement  shall  remain                operative  and in full  force and effect  regardless  of: (i) any                investigation  made by or on behalf  of agent or their  officers,                directors or controlling persons,  agent or employees or by or on                behalf  of the  Company,  the MHC or the  Bank  or any  officers,                directors  or  controlling  persons,  agent or  employees  of the                Company,  the  MHC or the  Bank;  (ii)  delivery  of and  payment                hereunder  for the  Shares;  or  (iii)  any  termination  of this





               Agreement.

         Section 9.  Contribution.  In order to provide  for just and  equitable contribution  in  circumstances  in which the  indemnification  provided  for in Section 8 is due in  accordance  with its terms but is for any reason  held by a court to be unavailable  from the Company,  the MHC, the Bank or the Agent,  the Company,  the MHC,  the Bank and the Agent  shall  contribute  to the  aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including any investigation,  legal and other  expenses  incurred in connection  with, and any amount paid in settlement of, any action,  suit or proceeding of any claims asserted,  but after deducting any  contribution  received by the Company,  the MHC, the Bank or the Agent from persons  other  than  the  other  party  thereto,  who may  also be  liable  for contribution)  in such  proportion  so that the  Agent is  responsible  for that portion  represented by the percentage  that the fees paid to the Agent pursuant to  Section 2 of this  Agreement  (not  including  expenses)  bears to the gross proceeds  received by the Company  from the sale of the Shares in the  Offering, and the Company,  the MHC and the Bank shall be responsible for the balance. If, however,  the allocation provided above is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified  party failed to give the notice required under Section 8 above, then each indemnifying  party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified  party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative fault of the Company, the MHC and the Bank on the one hand and the Agent on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses,  claims,  damages or  liabilities  (or actions,  proceedings  or claims in respect  thereto),  but also the  relative  benefits  received  by the Company,  the MHC and the Bank on the one hand and the Agent on the  other  from the Offering (before deducting expenses). The relative fault shall be determined by  reference  to,  among other  things,  whether  the untrue or alleged  untrue statement  of a material  fact or the  omission  or alleged  omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company, the MHC and/or the Bank on the one hand or the Agent on the other and the parties' relative intent, good faith,  knowledge,  access to  information  and  opportunity  to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company, the MHC, the Bank and the Agent agree that it would not be just and equitable if  contribution  pursuant to this Section 9 were determined by pro-rata allocation or by any other

                                       36

method  of   allocation   which  does  not  take  into  account  the   equitable considerations  referred to above in this  Section 9. The amount paid or payable by  an  indemnified  party  as a  result  of  the  losses,  claims,  damages  or liabilities (or actions,  proceedings or claims in respect thereof)  referred to above in this  Section 9 shall be deemed to include any legal or other  expenses reasonably  incurred by such indemnified party in connection with  investigating or defending any such action,  proceeding or claim. It is expressly  agreed that the Agent shall not be liable for any loss, liability,  claim, damage or expense or be required  to  contribute  any amount  which in the  aggregate  exceeds the amount paid (excluding reimbursable expenses) to the Agent under this Agreement. It is understood  that the above stated  limitation on the Agent's  liability is essential  to the  Agent and that the Agent  would  not have  entered  into this Agreement  if such  limitation  had not been  agreed to by the  parties  to this Agreement.  No person found guilty of any fraudulent  misrepresentation  (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to  contribution from any person who was not found guilty of such  fraudulent  misrepresentation. The  obligations  of the Company,  the MHC and the Bank under this Section 9 and under Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability  which the Company and the Bank may  otherwise  have.  For purposes of this Section 9, each of the Agent's, the Company's,  the MHC or the Bank's officers and directors and each person, if any,  who  controls  the Agent or the  Company or the MHC or the Bank within the meaning  of the  1933  Act and the  1934 Act  shall  have  the  same  rights  to contribution as the Agent, the Company,  the MHC or the Bank. Any party entitled to contribution, promptly after receipt of notice of commencement of any action, suit,  claim or  proceeding  against  such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made against another party under this Section 9, will notify such party from whom  contribution may be sought,  but the omission to so notify such party shall not relieve the party from whom contribution may be sought from any other  obligation it may have hereunder or otherwise than under this Section 9.

         Section 10. Survival of Agreements,  Representations  and  Indemnities. The respective  indemnities of the Company,  the MHC, the Bank and the Agent and the representations and warranties and other statements of the Company, the MHC, the Bank and the Agent set forth in or made  pursuant  to this  Agreement  shall remain in full force and effect,  regardless of any  termination or cancellation of this Agreement or any  investigation  made by or on behalf of the Agent,  the Company,  the MHC, the Bank or any  controlling  person referred to in Section 8 hereof,  and shall  survive the  issuance of the Shares,  and any  successor  or assign of the Agent,  the Company,  the MHC, the Bank, and any such  controlling person  shall  be  entitled  to  the  benefit  of  the  respective   agreements, indemnities, warranties and representations.

         Section 11.  Termination.  The Agent may  terminate  this  Agreement by giving  the  notice  indicated  below in this  Section 11 at any time after this Agreement becomes effective as follows:

          (a)  In the  event  the  Company  fails to sell the  required  minimum                number of the Shares by _________,  2000, and in accordance  with                the provisions of the Plan or as required by the MHC Regulations,                and applicable law, this Agreement shall terminate upon refund by                the Company to each person who has  subscribed for or ordered any                of the Shares the full amount which it may





                                       37

               have  received  from  such  person,  together  with  interest  as                provided in the Prospectus,  and no party to this Agreement shall                have any obligation to the other hereunder, except for payment by                the  Company,  the MHC and/or  the Bank as set forth in  Sections                2(a), 6, 8 and 9 hereof.

          (b)  If any of the  conditions  specified  in Section 7 shall not have                been  fulfilled  when and as  required by this  Agreement  unless                waived in writing, or by the Closing Date, this Agreement and all                of the Agent's  obligations  hereunder  may be  cancelled  by the                Agent  by  notifying  the  Company,  the MHC and the Bank of such                cancellation in writing or by telegram at any time at or prior to                the  Closing  Date,  and any such  cancellation  shall be without                liability  of any party to any other  party  except as  otherwise                provided in Sections 2(a), 6, 8 and 9 hereof.

          (c)  If the Agent  elects to terminate  this  Agreement as provided in                this Section, the Company, the MHC and the Bank shall be notified                promptly by telephone or telegram, confirmed by letter.

         The Company,  the MHC and the Bank may terminate  this Agreement in the event the Agent is in material breach of the  representations  and warranties or covenants  contained  in Section 5 and such  breach has not been cured after the Company,  the MHC and the Bank  have  provided  the  Agent  with  notice of such breach.

         This Agreement may also be terminated by mutual written  consent of the parties hereto.
