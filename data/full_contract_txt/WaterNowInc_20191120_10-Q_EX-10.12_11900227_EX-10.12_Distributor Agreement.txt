WITHOUT REGARD TO ITS PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS. 11.9 Arbitration. The Parties shall use their respective best efforts to settle amicably any disputes, differences or controversies arising between the Parties out of or in connection with or in respect of this Agreement. However, if not so settled, then the same shall be submitted to arbitration and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be solely and finally settled by confidential binding arbitration, except as specifically provided otherwise herein. The confidential arbitration proceeding shall be held in Collin County, Texas and shall be conducted in accordance with the alternative dispute resolution rules of the American Arbitration Association. The arbitration proceeding shall be held before a single arbitrator unless (i) the matter in controversy exceeds Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000), (ii) the Parties cannot agree on the arbitrator, or (iii) either Party requests a panel of three (3) arbitrators. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction, or application may be made to such court for a judicial acceptance of the award and any order of enforcement as the case may be. The arbitrator shall not award any Party punitive, exemplary, multiplied or consequential damages, and each Party hereby irrevocably waives any right to seek such damages in arbitration or in judicial proceedings. Each Party shall bear its own costs in the arbitration, and the fees and expenses of the arbitration shall be shared equally by the Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the arbitrator shall have the right and authority to apportion among the parties all reasonable costs, including attorneys' fees and witness fees, taking into account the relative fault of the Parties. The foregoing provisions of this Section 11.9 do not limit the right of a Party to seek injunctive or other equitable relief from a court of competent jurisdiction pending resolution of a dispute by arbitration. 11.10 Jurisdiction and Venue. Subject to the arbitration provisions set forth in Section 11.10, any judicial proceeding brought by or against either of the Parties on any dispute arising out of this Agreement or any matter relating thereto shall be brought in any federal or state court sitting or having jurisdiction in the County of Collin, State of Texas, and by execution and delivery of this Agreement, each Party hereby accepts for itself the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the aforesaid courts as trial courts, and irrevocably agrees to be bound by any final non-appealable judgment rendered in connection with this Agreement. 11.11 Number and Gender.

Furthermore, in lieu of such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision, there shall be added automatically as part hereof a provision as similar in terms, but in any event no more restrictive than, such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision as may be possible and be legal, valid and enforceable. 11.14 Entirety.
