time to time designate by notice to the paying Party.

[***].

6.8 Withholding Taxes.

6.8.1 Withholding Amounts. Where any sum due to be paid to either Party hereunder is subject to any withholding or similar tax, the Parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to do all such acts and things and to sign all such documents as will enable them to take advantage of any applicable double taxation agreement or treaty. In the event there is no applicable double taxation agreement or treaty, or if an applicable double taxation agreement or treaty reduces but does not eliminate such withholding or similar tax, the payor shall remit such withholding or similar tax to the appropriate government authority, deduct the amount paid from the amount due to payee and secure and send to payee the best available evidence of the payment of such withholding or similar tax. Any such amounts deducted by the payor in respect of such withholding or similar tax shall be treated as having been paid by the payor for purposes of this Agreement. If withholding or similar taxes are paid to a government authority, each Party will provide the other such assistance as is reasonably required to obtain a refund of the withheld or similar taxes, or to obtain a credit with respect to such taxes paid. In the event that a government authority retroactively determines that a payment made by the paying Party to the receiving Party pursuant to this Agreement should have been subject to withholding or similar (or to additional withholding or similar) taxes, and such paying Party (the "Withholding Party") remits such withholding or similar taxes to the government authority, including any interest and penalties that may be imposed thereon (together with the tax paid, the "Withholding Amount"), the Withholding Party will have the right (a) to offset the Withholding Amount against future payment obligations of the Withholding Party under this Agreement or (b) to invoice the receiving Party for the Withholding Amount (which shall be payable by the receiving Party within [***] of its receipt of such invoice), or to pursue reimbursement of the Withholding Amount by any other available remedy.

6.8.2 Withholding Actions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties acknowledge and agree that if AbbVie (or its assignee pursuant to Section 13.4) is required by Applicable Law to withhold taxes in respect of any amount payable under this Agreement, and if such withholding obligation arises as a result of any action taken by AbbVie or its Affiliate or successor or assignee, including without limitation an assignment of this Agreement as permitted under Section 13.4 of this Agreement, a change in tax residency of AbbVie, or payments arise or are deemed to arise through a branch of AbbVie and such withholding taxes exceed the amount of withholding taxes that would have been applicable if such action had not occurred (each an "AbbVie Withholding Tax Action"), then, any such amount payable shall be increased to take into account such increased withholding taxes as may be necessary so that, after making all required withholdings Harpoon (or its assignee pursuant to Section 13.4) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such AbbVie Withholding Tax Action occurred. Harpoon shall (a) use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain an exemption of such withheld amounts to the extent practicable under Applicable Law and (b) cooperate with AbbVie to obtain a reduction or refund of such withheld amounts.

6.9 Indirect Taxes. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all payments due under this Agreement are exclusive of value added taxes, sales taxes, consumption taxes and other similar taxes (the "Indirect Taxes"). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, AbbVie shall be responsible for any Indirect Taxes as well as any transfer, documentary, sales use, stamp, registration, value added or other similar tax that is imposed with respect to the payments or the related transfer of rights or other property pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. If the Indirect Taxes originally paid or otherwise borne by the paying Party are in whole or in part subsequently determined not to have been chargeable, all reasonably necessary steps will be taken by the receiving Party to receive a refund of these undue Indirect Taxes from the

- 40 -

applicable governmental authority or other fiscal authority and any amount of undue Indirect Taxes repaid by such authority to the receiving Party will be transferred to the paying Party within [***] of receipt.

6.10 Interest on Late Payments. If any payment due to either Party under this Agreement is not paid when due, then such paying Party shall pay interest thereon (before and after any judgment) at [***] such interest to run from the date on which payment of such sum became due until payment thereof in full together with such interest; provided however that [***], then such interest [***], as adjusted from time to time on the [***].

6.11 Audit. AbbVie shall, shall cause its Affiliates to, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its Sublicensees to, keep complete and accurate books and records pertaining to Net Sales of Licensed Products, in sufficient detail to calculate all amounts payable hereunder. At the request of Harpoon, AbbVie shall permit an independent public accounting firm of nationally recognized standing designated by Harpoon and reasonably acceptable to AbbVie, [***], to audit the books and records maintained pursuant to this Section 6.11 to ensure the accuracy of all reports and payments made hereunder, including any permitted deductions from Net Sales pursuant to Section 1.108. Such examinations may not (a) be conducted for any [***] [***] (b) be conducted more than once in any [***] period or (c) be [***] (unless a previous audit revealed an underpayment with respect to such [***]). The accounting firm shall disclose to Harpoon only whether the reports are correct or not, and the specific details concerning any discrepancies. No other information shall be shared. Except as provided below, the cost of this audit shall be borne by Harpoon, unless the audit reveals a variance [***] from the reported amounts or [***], in which case AbbVie shall bear the cost of the audit.

6.12 Audit Dispute. In the event of a dispute with respect to any audit under Section 6.11, Harpoon and AbbVie shall work in good faith to resolve the disagreement. If the Parties are unable to reach a mutually acceptable resolution of any such dispute within [***], the dispute shall be submitted for resolution to a certified public accounting firm jointly selected by each Party's certified public accountants or to such other Person as the Parties shall mutually agree (the "Audit Expert"). The decision of the Audit Expert shall be final and the costs of such determination as well as the initial audit shall be borne between the Parties in such manner as the Audit Expert shall determine. Not later than [***] after such decision and in accordance with such decision, AbbVie shall pay the additional amounts or Harpoon shall reimburse the excess payments, as applicable.

6.13 Confidentiality. The receiving Party shall treat all information subject to review under this Article 6 in accordance with the confidentiality provisions of Article 9 and the Parties shall cause the Audit Expert to enter into a reasonably acceptable confidentiality agreement with AbbVie obligating such firm to retain all such financial information in confidence pursuant to such confidentiality agreement.

6.14 [***] The development and regulatory milestone payments, first commercial sales milestone payments, sales-based milestone payments and royalties in Sections 6.2, 6.3 6.4, and 6.5 shall not apply at the same rates to Development and Commercialization of Licensed Compounds or Licensed Products [***] for eligibility to be treated for such disease, state, or condition with a Licensed Compound or Licensed Product or for monitoring patients who are or have been treated with a Licensed Compound or Licensed Product. In the event that a Licensed Compound or Licensed Product is Developed for any such purposes, [***] for the sale of such Licensed Product that [***] of such Licensed Product and [***], as applicable; provided that, for clarity, any such [***]

On or after the License Option Exercise Closing Date, AbbVie shall have the sole right to decide whether a Joint Patent or a Product-Specific Patent should be validated or maintained as a Unitary Patent, whether and when such Patent should be opted out of or opted in to the jurisdiction of the Unified Patent Court (UPC) (including withdrawal of an opt-out), as well as any other issues concerning the jurisdiction of the UPC in connection with such Patent. Harpoon shall, at AbbVie's cost and expense, cooperate with AbbVie and provide to AbbVie and submit to authorities all necessary documents to effect such decision.

7.2.6 Patent Listings. With respect to each Licensed Product, AbbVie will have the sole right to list Joint Patents and Product-Specific Patents with Regulatory Authorities or other agencies, including as required or allowed under Applicable Law.

7.3 Enforcement of Patents.

7.3.1 Enforcement of Harpoon Patents. Each Party shall promptly notify the other Party in writing of any alleged or threatened infringement of the Product-Specific Patents by a Third Party in the Territory of which such Party becomes aware based on the development, commercialization or Exploitation of, or an application to market, a Licensed Product or a product containing a Licensed Compound in the Territory (the "Product Infringement"). AbbVie shall have the sole right, but not the obligation, to prosecute any Product Infringement involving any claims of Product-Specific Patents at its sole expense and AbbVie shall retain control of the prosecution of such claim, suit or proceeding. Harpoon shall have the right to join as a party to such claim, suit, or proceeding in the Territory and participate with its own counsel at its own expense; provided that AbbVie shall retain control of the prosecution of such claim, suit, or proceeding. During any such claim, suit, or proceeding, AbbVie shall keep Harpoon reasonably informed of all material developments in connection with such claim, suit or proceeding. If AbbVie does not take commercially reasonable steps to prosecute (including settling) such a Product Infringement in a country or jurisdiction, then (a) Harpoon may, but is not obligated to, prosecute the Product Infringement at its own expense in such country or jurisdiction, and (b) if Harpoon prosecutes such Product Infringement and obtains an injunction that prevents the sale of a Biosimilar Product by such Third Party in such country or jurisdiction, AbbVie shall not be entitled to apply any royalty reductions pursuant to Section 6.5.3(a) that would otherwise apply as a result of the sale of such Biosimilar Product by such Third Party after the period of such injunction.

7.3.2 Enforcement of AbbVie Patents and Joint Patents.

(a) Each Party shall promptly notify the other Party in writing of any alleged or threatened infringement of the Harpoon Patents that are not Product-Specific Patents, AbbVie Patents or Joint Patents by a Third Party in the Territory of which such Party becomes aware based on the development, commercialization, Exploitation, or an application to market a Licensed Product or a product containing a Licensed Compound in the Territory.

(b) Subject to Sections 7.3.3 and 7.3.4, Harpoon shall have the first right, but not the obligation, to prosecute any such alleged or threatened infringement of Harpoon Patents that are not Product-Specific Patents in the Territory at its sole expense and Harpoon shall retain control of the

prosecution of such claim, suit or proceeding. If Harpoon prosecutes any such infringement, AbbVie shall have the right to join as a party to such claim, suit or proceeding in the Territory and participate with its own counsel at its own expense; provided that Harpoon shall retain control of the prosecution of such claim, suit or proceeding. During any such claim, suit, or proceeding, Harpoon shall keep AbbVie reasonably informed of all material developments in connection with such claim, suit or proceeding. If Harpoon does not take commercially reasonable steps to prosecute the alleged or threatened infringement in the Territory with respect to such Harpoon Patents, then solely following the License Option Exercise Closing Date, AbbVie may prosecute such infringement in the Territory at its own expense, unless Harpoon reasonably believes that the prosecution of such infringement by AbbVie would have a material adverse impact on Harpoon's global patent portfolio, or upon the use or application of such Harpoon Patents in connection with other products and compounds Controlled by Harpoon, its Affiliates or sublicensees. For clarity, this Section 7.3.2(b) is inapplicable to any biosimilar patent litigation relating to any Licensed Compound or Licensed Product as set forth in Sections 7.3.3 and 7.3.4.

(c) AbbVie shall have the sole right, but not the obligation, to prosecute any such infringement of the AbbVie Patents in the Territory at its sole expense and AbbVie shall retain control of the prosecution of such claim, suit or proceeding.

(d) AbbVie shall have the first right, but not the obligation, to prosecute any such infringement of Joint Patents in the Territory at its sole expense and AbbVie shall retain control of the prosecution of such claim, suit or proceeding. If AbbVie prosecutes any such infringement, Harpoon shall have the right to join as a party to such claim, suit or proceeding in the Territory and participate with its own counsel at its own expense; provided that AbbVie shall retain control of the prosecution of such claim, suit or proceeding. During any such claim, suit, or proceeding, AbbVie shall keep Harpoon reasonably informed of all material developments in connection with such claim, suit or proceeding. If AbbVie does not take commercially reasonable steps to prosecute the alleged or threatened infringement in the Territory with respect to such Joint Patents, then Harpoon may prosecute such infringement in the Territory at its own expense.

7.3.3 Patent Exclusivity Listings. If either Party receives a copy of an application submitted to the FDA under subsection (k) of Section 351 of the PHSA (a "Biosimilar Application") naming a Licensed Product as a reference product or otherwise becomes aware that such a Biosimilar Application has been filed (such as in an instance described in Section 351(l)(9)(C) of the PHSA), such Party shall, within [***], notify the other Party so that the other Party may seek permission to view the application and related confidential information from the filer of the Biosimilar Application under Section 351(l)(1)(B)(iii) of the PHSA. If either Party receives any equivalent or similar certification or notice in any other jurisdiction in the Territory, either Party shall, within [***], notify and provide the other Party with copies of such communication.

AbbVie shall have the first right to bring an action for infringement of the AbbVie Patents, Joint Patents, Product-Specific Patents and, upon the written consent of Harpoon, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed (taking into account, without limitation, the potential impact of such consent on Harpoon's platform technology and/or other products undergoing development or commercialization by Harpoon or its Third Party licensees and covered by such Harpoon Patents), other Harpoon Patents, including as required under Section 351(l)(6) of the PHSA following the agreement on a list of patents for litigation under Section 351(l)(4) or exchange of Patent lists pursuant to Section 351(l)(5)(B) of such act, or as required following any equivalent or similar certification or notice in any other jurisdiction. If Harpoon decides pursuant to this Agreement not to allow AbbVie to include such other Harpoon Patents in a litigation against a biosimilar applicant for a biosimilar product, Harpoon shall not assert such Patent in any litigation against the same biosimilar applicant for the same biosimilar product without written approval by AbbVie. The Parties' rights and obligations with respect to the foregoing legal actions shall be as set forth in Sections 7.3.1 through 7.3.5; provided that within [***] of reaching agreement on a list of Patents for litigation under Section 351(l)(4) or exchange of Patent lists pursuant to Section 351(l) (5)(B), AbbVie shall notify Harpoon as to whether or not it elects to prosecute such infringement. Either Party shall, within [***], notify and provide the other Party with copies of any notice of commercial marketing provided by the filer of a Biosimilar Application pursuant to Section 351(l)(8)(A) of the PHSA, or any equivalent or similar certification or notice in any other jurisdiction. Thereafter, AbbVie shall have the first right to seek an injunction or other remedies against such commercial marketing as permitted pursuant to Section 351(l)(8)(B) of the PHSA.

7.3.5 Cooperation. The Parties agree to cooperate fully in any infringement action pursuant to this Section 7.3.

Unless otherwise set forth herein, the Party entitled to bring any patent infringement litigation in accordance with this Section 7.3 shall have the right to settle such claim; provided that neither Party shall have the right to settle any patent infringement litigation under this Section 7.3 in a manner that imposes any costs or liability on, or involves any admission by, the other Party, without the express written consent of such other Party. The Party commencing the litigation shall provide the other Party with copies of all pleadings and other documents filed with the court if doing so would not waive any privilege or violate any court order or Applicable Law, and shall consider reasonable input from the other Party during the course of the proceedings.

7.3.6 Recovery. Any recovery realized as a result of such litigation described in Section 7.3.1, 7.3.2, or 7.3.5 (whether by way of settlement or otherwise) shall be first, allocated to reimburse the Parties for their costs and expenses in making such recovery (which amounts shall be allocated pro rata if insufficient to cover the totality of such expenses).

Subject to Section 11.2, AbbVie shall have the first right, but not the obligation, to defend and control the defense of any such claim, suit, or proceeding at its own expense, using counsel of its own choice. Harpoon may participate in any such claim, suit, or proceeding with counsel of its choice at its own expense. The assumption of the defense of a claim that may be subject to Section 11.2 by either AbbVie or Harpoon shall not be construed as an acknowledgment that Harpoon is liable to indemnify any AbbVie Indemnitee in respect of such indemnity claim, nor shall it constitute a waiver by Harpoon of any defenses it may assert against an AbbVie Indemnitee's claim for indemnification. Without limitation of the foregoing, if AbbVie finds it necessary or desirable to join Harpoon as a party to any such action, Harpoon shall, at AbbVie's expense, execute all papers and perform such acts as shall be reasonably required. If AbbVie elects (in a written communication submitted to Harpoon within a reasonable amount of time after notice of the alleged patent infringement) not to defend or control the defense of, or otherwise fails to initiate and maintain the defense of, any such claim, suit, or proceeding, within such time periods so that Harpoon is not prejudiced by any delays, Harpoon may conduct and control the defense of any such claim, suit, or proceeding at its own expense.

If the Party who is prosecuting the Joint Patents at the relevant time elects not to defend or control the defense of the Joint Patents in a suit brought in the Territory, or otherwise fails to initiate and maintain the defense of any such claim, suit, or proceeding, then the other Party may conduct and control the defense of any such claim, suit, or proceeding, at its own expense.

In addition, the Parties acknowledge and agree that, with regard to such prosecution, maintenance, enforcement and defense, the interests of the Parties as collaborators and Harpoon and licensee are to, for their mutual benefit, obtain patent protection and plan patent defense against potential infringement activities by Third Parties, and as such, are aligned and are legal in nature. The Parties agree and acknowledge that they have not waived, and nothing in this Agreement constitutes a waiver of, any legal privilege concerning Patents under this Article 7, including privilege under the common interest doctrine and similar or related doctrines. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, to the extent a Party has a good faith belief that any information required to be disclosed by such Party to the other Party under this Article 7 is protected by attorney-client privilege or any other applicable legal privilege or immunity, such Party shall not be required to disclose such information and the Parties shall in good faith cooperate to agree upon a procedure (which may include entering into a specific common interest agreement, disclosing such information on a "for counsel eyes only" basis or similar procedure) under which such information may be disclosed without waiving or breaching such privilege or immunity.

ARTICLE 11 INDEMNITY

11.1 Indemnification of Harpoon. AbbVie shall indemnify Harpoon, its Affiliates and its and their respective directors, officers, employees, and agents (the "Harpoon Indemnitees") and defend and save each of them harmless, from and against any and all losses, damages, liabilities, penalties, costs, taxes (including penalties and interest) and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) (collectively, "Losses") in connection with any and all suits, investigations, claims, or demands of Third Parties (collectively, "Third Party Claims") incurred by or rendered against the Harpoon Indemnitees arising from or occurring as a result of: [***]

11.2 Indemnification of AbbVie. Harpoon shall indemnify AbbVie, its Affiliates and its and their respective directors, officers, employees, and agents (the "AbbVie Indemnitees"), and defend and save each of them harmless, from and against any and all Losses in connection with any and all Third Party Claims incurred by or rendered against the AbbVie Indemnitees arising from or occurring as a result of: [***]

11.3 Notice of Claim. All indemnification claims in respect of a Party, its Affiliates, or their respective directors, officers, employees and agents shall be made solely by such Party to this Agreement (the "Indemnified Party"). The Indemnified Party shall give the indemnifying Party prompt written notice (an "Indemnification Claim Notice") of any Losses or discovery of fact upon which such Indemnified Party intends to base a request for indemnification under this Article 11, but in no event shall the indemnifying Party be liable for any Losses to the extent resulting from any delay in providing such notice. Each Indemnification Claim Notice must contain a description of the claim and the nature and amount of such Loss (to the extent

- 59 -

Source: HARPOON THERAPEUTICS, INC., 10-K, 3/12/2020





that the nature and amount of such Loss is known at such time). The Indemnified Party shall furnish promptly to the indemnifying Party copies of all papers and official documents received in respect of any Losses and Third Party Claims.

11.4 Control of Defense.

11.4.1 In General. Subject to the provisions of Sections 7.4 (if applicable), 7.5 and 7.6, at its option, the indemnifying Party may assume the defense of any Third Party Claim by giving written notice to the Indemnified Party within [***] after the indemnifying Party's receipt of an Indemnification Claim Notice. The assumption of the defense of a Third Party Claim by the indemnifying Party shall not be construed as an acknowledgment that the indemnifying Party is liable to indemnify the Indemnified Party in respect of the Third Party Claim, nor shall it constitute a waiver by the indemnifying Party of any defenses it may assert against the Indemnified Party's claim for indemnification. Upon assuming the defense of a Third Party Claim, the indemnifying Party may appoint as lead counsel in the defense of the Third Party Claim any legal counsel selected by the indemnifying Party which shall be reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party. In the event the indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall promptly deliver to the indemnifying Party all original notices and documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party in connection with the Third Party Claim. Should the indemnifying Party assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, except as provided in Section 11.4.2, the indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with the analysis, defense or settlement of the Third Party Claim unless specifically requested in writing by the indemnifying Party. In the event that it is ultimately determined that the indemnifying Party is not obligated to indemnify, defend or hold harmless the Indemnified Party from and against the Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall reimburse the indemnifying Party for any Losses incurred by the indemnifying Party in its defense of the Third Party Claim.

11.4.2 Right to Participate in Defense. Without limiting Section 11.4.1, any Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in, but not control, the defense of such Third Party Claim and to employ counsel of its choice for such purpose; provided that such employment shall be at the Indemnified Party's own expense unless (a) the employment thereof, and the assumption by the indemnifying Party of such expense, has been specifically authorized by the indemnifying Party in writing, (b) the indemnifying Party has failed to assume the defense and employ counsel in accordance with Section 11.4.1 (in which case the Indemnified Party shall control the defense), or (c) the interests of the Indemnified Party and the indemnifying Party with respect to such Third Party Claim are sufficiently adverse to prohibit the representation by the same counsel of both Parties under Applicable Law, ethical rules or equitable principles (in which case the Indemnifying Party shall control its defense and the Indemnified Party shall control the defense of the Indemnified Party).

11.4.3 Settlement. With respect to any Losses relating solely to the payment of money damages in connection with a Third Party Claim and that shall not result in the Indemnified Party's becoming subject to injunctive or other relief, and as to which the indemnifying Party shall have acknowledged in writing the obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party hereunder, the indemnifying Party shall have the sole right to consent to the entry of any judgment, enter into any settlement or otherwise dispose of such Loss, on such terms as the indemnifying Party, in its sole discretion, shall deem appropriate. With respect to all other Losses in connection with Third Party Claims, where the indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of the Third Party Claim in accordance with Section 11.4.1, the indemnifying Party shall have authority to consent to the entry of any judgment, enter into any settlement or otherwise dispose of such Loss; provided that it obtains the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). If the indemnifying Party does not assume and conduct the defense of a Third Party Claim as provided above, the Indemnified Party may defend against such Third Party Claim. Regardless of whether the indemnifying Party chooses to defend or prosecute any Third Party Claim, no Indemnified Party shall admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or dispose of, any Third Party Claim without

- 60 -

Source: HARPOON THERAPEUTICS, INC., 10-K, 3/12/2020





the prior written consent of the indemnifying Party. The indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any settlement, compromise or other disposition of a Loss by an Indemnified Party that is reached without the written consent of the indemnifying Party.

11.4.4 Cooperation. Regardless of whether the indemnifying Party chooses to defend or prosecute any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall, and shall cause each indemnitee to, cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof and shall furnish such records, information and testimony, provide such witnesses and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith. Such cooperation shall include access [***] afforded to the indemnifying Party to, and reasonable retention by the Indemnified Party of, records and information that are reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making Indemnified Parties and other employees and agents available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder, and the indemnifying Party shall reimburse the Indemnified Party for all its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in connection therewith, subject to refund if the Indemnifying Party is ultimately held not to be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party.

11.4.5 Expenses. Except as provided above, the reasonable and verifiable costs and expenses, including fees and disbursements of counsel, incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with any Third Party Claim shall be reimbursed on a [***] basis in arrears by the indemnifying Party, without prejudice to the indemnifying Party's right to contest the Indemnified Party's right to indemnification and subject to refund in the event the indemnifying Party is ultimately held not to be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party.

11.5 Special, Indirect, and Other Losses. EXCEPT (A) FOR FRAUD, WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OR GROSS NEGLIGENCE, (B) FOR A PARTY'S BREACH OF ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER [ARTICLE 9 OR SECTION 5.8], (C) AS PROVIDED UNDER [***] AND (D) TO THE EXTENT ANY SUCH DAMAGES ARE REQUIRED TO BE PAID TO A THIRD PARTY AS PART OF A CLAIM FOR WHICH A PARTY PROVIDES INDEMNIFICATION UNDER THIS ARTICLE 11, NEITHER PARTY NOR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES SHALL BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOSS OF PROFITS OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, BREACH OF STATUTORY DUTY OR OTHERWISE IN CONNECTION WITH OR ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE USE OF THE LICENSED COMPOUNDS OR LICENSED PRODUCTS, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

12.1.1 Term. This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and, unless earlier terminated in accordance herewith, shall continue in force and effect until (a) the date of expiration of the last Royalty Term for the last Licensed Product, or (b) the expiration of the License Option Period and the failure of AbbVie to exercise the License Option (such period, the "Term").

For purposes of clarity, AbbVie shall continue to make payments thereon as provided in Article 6 (as if this Agreement had not terminated with respect to such Major Market or country or other jurisdiction).

ARTICLE 13 MISCELLANEOUS

13.1 Force Majeure. Neither Party shall be held liable or responsible to the other Party or be deemed to have defaulted under or breached this Agreement for failure or delay in fulfilling or performing any term of this Agreement when such failure or delay is caused by or results from events beyond the reasonable control of the non-performing Party, including fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, embargoes, shortages, epidemics, quarantines, war, acts of war (whether war be declared or not), terrorist acts, insurrections, riots, civil commotion, acts of God or acts, omissions or delays in acting by any governmental authority (except to the extent such delay results from the breach by the non-performing Party or any of its Affiliates of any term or condition of this Agreement).

Each Party agrees that it will not export, directly or indirectly, any technical information acquired from the other Party under this Agreement or any products using such technical information to a location or in a manner that at the time of export requires an export license or other governmental approval, without first obtaining the written consent to do so from the appropriate agency or other governmental entity in accordance with Applicable Law.

13.4 Assignment.

13.4.1 Without the prior written consent of the other Party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed, neither Party shall sell, transfer, assign, delegate, pledge, or otherwise dispose of, whether voluntarily, involuntarily, by operation of law or otherwise, this Agreement or any of its rights or duties hereunder; provided that either Party may make such an assignment without the other Party's consent to its Affiliate or to a successor, whether in a merger, sale of stock, sale of assets or any other transaction, of the business to which this Agreement relates. With respect to an assignment to an Affiliate, the assigning Party shall remain responsible for the performance by such Affiliate of the rights and obligations hereunder. Any attempted assignment or delegation in violation of this Section 13.4 shall be void and of no effect. All validly assigned and delegated rights and obligations of the Parties hereunder shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by and against the successors and permitted assigns of Harpoon or AbbVie, as the case may be.

This Agreement, together with the Schedules attached hereto, sets forth and constitutes the entire agreement and understanding between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and all prior agreements, understandings, promises, and representations, whether written or oral, with respect thereto are superseded hereby (including that certain Mutual Confidentiality Disclosure Agreement between the Parties or their respective Affiliates dated [***] (the "Prior NDA"). The foregoing shall not be interpreted as a waiver of any remedies available to either Party as a result of any breach, prior to the Effective Date, by the other Party (or its Affiliates) of its obligations under the Prior NDA. Each Party confirms that it is not relying on any representations or warranties of the other Party except as specifically set forth in this Agreement.

Any translation into any other language shall not be an official version thereof, and in the event of any conflict in interpretation between the English version and such translation, the English version shall control.

13.11 Equitable Relief. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that the restrictions set forth in Section 5.8 and Articles 7 and 9 are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the other Party and that such other Party would not have entered into this Agreement in the absence of such restrictions, and that any breach or threatened breach of any provision of such Section or Articles may result in irreparable injury to such other Party for which there may be no adequate remedy at law. In the event of a breach or threatened breach of any provision of such Section or Articles, the non-breaching Party shall be authorized and entitled to seek from any court of competent jurisdiction injunctive relief, whether preliminary or permanent, specific performance, and an equitable accounting of all earnings, profits, and other benefits arising from such breach, which rights shall be cumulative and in addition to any other rights or remedies to which such non-breaching Party may be entitled in law or equity. Both Parties agree to waive any requirement that the other (a) post a bond or other security as a condition for obtaining any such relief, and (b) show irreparable harm, balancing of harms, consideration of the public interest, or inadequacy of monetary damages as a remedy.

13.12 Waiver and Non-Exclusion of Remedies. Any term or condition of this Agreement may be waived at any time by the Party that is entitled to the benefit thereof, but no such waiver shall be effective unless set forth in a written instrument duly executed by or on behalf of the Party waiving such term or condition. The waiver by either Party hereto of any right hereunder or of the failure to perform or of a breach by the other Party shall not be deemed a waiver of any other right hereunder or of any other breach or failure by such other Party whether of a similar nature or otherwise. The rights and remedies provided herein are cumulative and do not exclude any other right or remedy provided by Applicable Law or otherwise available except as expressly set forth herein.

13.13 No Benefit to Third Parties. Except as provided in Article 11, covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement are for the sole benefit of the Parties hereto and their successors and permitted assigns, and they shall not be construed as conferring any rights on any other Persons.
