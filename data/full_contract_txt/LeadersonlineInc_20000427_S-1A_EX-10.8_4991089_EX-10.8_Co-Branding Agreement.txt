    8.1.  Negotiation and Escalation.

If negotiation does not result in a resolution within 30 days of the date one Party first notifies the other of the controversy or claim, either Party may resort to arbitration under Section 8.2  [Arbitration].

    8.2.  Arbitration.  Any controversy or claim between the Parties concerning any breach or alleged breach of this Agreement or performance or nonperformance of any obligation under this Agreement or otherwise with respect to this Agreement which cannot be resolved by negotiation will be resolved by binding arbitration under this Section 8.2  [Arbitration] and the then-current Commercial Rules and supervision of the American Arbitration Association (the "AAA"). If any part of this Section 8.2  [Arbitration] is held to be unenforceable, it will be severed and will not affect either the duty to arbitrate or any other part of this Section 8.2  [Arbitration].  The arbitration will be held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, before a sole disinterested arbitrator who is knowledgeable in business information and the Internet and experienced in handling commercial disputes.  The arbitrator shall be appointed jointly by the Parties hereto within 30 days following the date on which the arbitration is instituted.  If the Parties are unable to agree upon the arbitrator within such 30-day period, the AAA shall be instructed to select such arbitrator within 15 days thereafter.  The arbitrator's award will be final and binding and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.  The arbitrator will not have the power to award punitive or exemplary damages, or any damages excluded by, or in excess of, any damage limitations expressed in this Agreement.  Issues of arbitrability will be determined in accordance solely with the federal substantive and procedural laws relating to arbitration; in all other respects, the arbitrator will be obligated to apply and follow the substantive law of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

    8.3.  Equitable Relief.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event of an alleged violation of Article 9 of this Agreement by either Party, the Party alleging such a violation may seek temporary and permanent injunctive or other appropriate equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction pending appointment of an arbitrator.  The Party requesting such relief shall simultaneously file a demand for arbitration of the dispute, and shall request that the AAA proceed under its rules for an expedited hearing.

    8.4.  Costs. Unless the arbitrator, if any, determines otherwise, each Party will bear its own attorneys' fees and other costs associated with the negotiation and arbitration provided for by this Article 8, except that costs and expenses of the arbitrator shall be shared equally. If court proceedings to stay litigation or compel arbitration are necessary, the Party who unsuccessfully initiates or opposes such proceedings will pay all associated costs, expenses and attorneys' fees that are reasonably incurred by the other Party.  To the extent that any claim in arbitration relates to the collection of amounts owed under Article 6, the Party entitled to collect such amounts shall be entitled to recover all reasonable costs of collection, including expenses and attorneys' fees that are reasonably incurred.

    8.5.  Two Year Limitation.  Except for claims under Sections 11.4  [Indemnification by LeadersOnline] and 11.5  [Indemnification by VerticalNet] hereof, neither Party may bring a claim or action regardless of form, arising out of or related to

                                       9

this Agreement, including any claim of fraud or misrepresentation, more than two years after the cause of action accrues or becomes known, whichever is later.

    8.6.  Confidentiality.  In order to facilitate the resolution of controversies or claims between the Parties with respect to each Party hereto, such controversies or claims, including details regarding negotiations, arbitration and settlement terms, shall be treated as Confidential Information of the other Party hereto in accordance with Article 9.

    8.7.  Remedial Measures. In the event of (a) any material remediable breach of this Agreement by the other Party which remains uncured 30 days after notice of such breach (other than a breach of a payment obligation) was received by the other Party or (b) any material breach which cannot be cured, the non-breaching Party may take reasonable remediable measures upon prior written notice and at the cost and expense of the breaching Party without prejudice and in addition to any other rights arising from such breach.  In addition, the non-breaching Party shall take reasonable steps to mitigate damages arising out of such breach.
