Franchisee acknowledges  that  Franchisee  shall  have no  right  to any  Territory  unless Franchisee  and  Pretzel  Time have  entered  into a separate  Area  Developer's Agreement. Franchisee shall have no exclusive Territory based on this Agreement.

         2.D.     RESERVATION OF RIGHTS.

         Except as expressly limited by Section 2.C., Pretzel Time (on behalf of itself,  its Affiliates and its designees)  retains all rights,  in its sole and exclusive discretion,  to offer to sell the Products and services authorized for Pretzel Time Units under the Marks  hereinafter  described in Section 6 or other trade names, trademarks, service marks and commercial symbols through similar or dissimilar  channels of distribution and national  accounts and pursuant to such terms and  conditions  as Pretzel Time deems  appropriate.  Pretzel Time and its Affiliates  retain the right to offer for sale and sell, and franchise others to offer for sale and sell,  any other  Products or services  under the "Marks" and own and  operate  and grant to others  the right to operate  Pretzel  Time Units solely or in conjunction with TCBY stores or other snack food businesses at such locations  and on such  terms  and  conditions  as  Pretzel  Time,  in its  sole discretion,  deems appropriate.  Such Products shall include, but not be limited to, soft pretzels,  frozen pretzels and other pretzel-related  products,  frozen yogurt and other Pretzel Time-approved Products and such methods of distribution may include,  but shall not be limited to, sales at sports  arenas and stadiums, amusement  parks,   department  stores,   airports,  toll  road  travel  plazas, hospitals, office buildings, schools and colleges and other Non Traditional Unit venues  as  well  as  sales  to  wholesalers  and/or  distributors  for  resale. Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  Pretzel Time reserves the right both within and outside the  Territory  (if any) to sell at wholesale  all Products and services which comprise a part of the Pretzel Time System.

         FRANCHISEE  ACKNOWLEDGES  AND AGREES THAT PRETZEL TIME HAS THE RIGHT TO PLACE UNITS AT ANY LOCATION,  EXCEPT AS LIMITED BY THIS  AGREEMENT,  AT ITS SOLE DISCRETION  AND  WITHOUT  REGARD TO THE IMPACT UPON THE  FRANCHISEE'S  BUSINESS. FRANCHISEE  ACKNOWLEDGES  THAT  ABSENT A SEPARATE  AREA  DEVELOPER'S  AGREEMENT, PRETZEL  TIME  HAS THE  RIGHT  TO  PLACE  UNITS  AT ANY  LOCATION,  AT ITS  SOLE DISCRETION, AND WITHOUT REGARD TO THE IMPACT UPON THE FRANCHISEE'S BUSINESS.

         Franchisee  acknowledges that because complete and detailed  uniformity under many varying  conditions  may not be possible or  practical,  Pretzel Time specifically reserves the right and privilege,  at its sole discretion and as it may deem in the best  interests of all  concerned in any specific  instance,  to





vary standards for any Franchisee based upon the peculiarities of the particular Site,  landlords'  requirements,  business potential,  or other conditions which Pretzel  Time deems to be of  importance  to the  successful  operation  of such Franchisee's business.

         2.E.     OPTION TO DEVELOP OTHER SITES WITHIN THE TERRITORY.

         If Franchisee  seeks to add a different type of Pretzel Time Unit, such as a kiosk or a cart,  within the Territory,  then  Franchisee must seek Pretzel Time's  approval by  notifying  Pretzel  Time,  in  writing,  that he desires to develop  and  operate  other  units,  including  a cart  or  kiosk,  within  the Territory.  If Pretzel  Time has fully  negotiated  a lease  agreement  for such location,  then  Franchisee  shall (1) obtain the  consent  of the  landlord  to execute such lease and execute such lease,  if applicable;  (2) execute  Pretzel Time's then current form of Satellite Unit Addendum  (containing  Pretzel Time's then  current  fees  and  expense  requirements)  and such  ancillary  documents (including guarantees) as are then customarily used by Pretzel Time in the grant of franchises for Pretzel Time Units as modified for use in connection  with the Site, as necessary, and (3) pay Pretzel Time's reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in locating such additional  Site and negotiating the lease  agreement, all within ten (10) business days after Pretzel Time's delivery to Franchisee of the lease agreement and the franchise documents.

         If Franchisee  timely notifies  Pretzel Time in writing that Franchisee desires to develop and operate an additional  Pretzel Time Unit, such as a kiosk or cart,  within its Territory and Pretzel Time has not fully negotiated a lease agreement for such location, then Franchisee will have thirty (30) days in which to negotiate and deliver to Pretzel Time a lease agreement for such site in form for execution.  If Pretzel Time  disapproves  the lease agreement for failure to meet  Pretzel  Time's  requirements,  Franchisee  will have ten (10) days within which to negotiate  and deliver to Pretzel Time a revised  lease  agreement  for such  location  in form for  execution.  If  Pretzel  Time  approves  the  lease agreement  for such  location  as  meeting  Pretzel  Time's  requirements,  then Franchisee  will (1) execute  such lease  agreement;  (2) execute the  franchise documents;   and  (3)  pay  Pretzel  Time's  reasonable  out-of-pocket  expenses incurred,  if any, in locating such  additional  Site and  negotiating the lease agreement,  all within ten (10) business days after Pretzel  Time's  delivery to Franchisee of the lease agreement and the franchise documents.

         2.F.     TERM OF FRANCHISE.

         The term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date of this Agreement  and shall expire  twenty (20) years from the  effective  date of this Agreement.  References in this  Agreement to the term of this Agreement mean the initial term and any renewal term.

The franchise fee is fully  earned  by  Pretzel  Time  upon the  payment  in full  thereof  and is nonrefundable   (except  as   specifically   provided  in  this   agreement)  as consideration for expenses incurred by Pretzel Time in furnishing assistance and services to Franchisee  and for Pretzel  Time's lost or deferred  opportunity to franchise others,  and not as compensation for the use of the copyrighted works, Marks or Trade Dress.

The Royalty is not uniform as to  all  franchisees,  it is  fully  earned,  and  is  nonrefundable  in  any circumstance.  Franchisee  shall pay weekly by electronic  funds  transfer (ACH) without offset,  defalcation,  credit or deduction of any nature to Pretzel Time the royalty fee, the advertising  fund fee and all other amounts due and payable on each Wednesday for the immediately  preceding week. The Royalty shall be paid by electronic funds transfer from Franchisee's  general operating  account.  The Royalty is paid,  in part,  to  compensate  Pretzel  Time for  various  services provided  to  Franchisee  after the Unit opens,  including,  but not limited to, quality, service, and cleanliness inspections. Pretzel Time, upon written notice to  Franchisee,  shall  have the right to  change  the  timing  of  Franchisee's payments of Royalty  Fees and  Advertising  Fund Fees due under this  Agreement. Franchisee  shall not subordinate to any other  obligation his obligation to pay the Royalty Fee or any other fee or charge hereunder.

The transfer fee is non-refundable. The fee shall be due and payable by the current  Franchisee to Pretzel Time five (5) days prior to the transfer of the Franchise to the assignee.  Additionally,  the assignee  of the  Franchisee  shall pay  Pretzel  Time an  additional  amount of Twenty-Five  Thousand Dollars  ($25,000.00) (plus $1,000.00 if Yogurt Product is included),  for any  additional  units that are not existing  stores or the then current initial franchisee fee for traditional Pretzel Time Units.

         4.F.     FEES FOR ADDITIONAL FRANCHISES.

          In the event that Franchisee  meets Pretzel Time's  qualifications  to open  additional  Franchises at sites  acceptable to both Franchisee and Pretzel Time,  which  approval is at the sole  discretion of Pretzel  Time,  the initial franchisee  fee shall be the greater of FIVE THOUSAND  DOLLARS  ($5,000.00)(plus $1,000.00 if Yogurt  Product is included) or the then current fee for additional franchises set by Pretzel Time, at its sole discretion. The decision to grant an additional  franchise  location shall be in the sole  discretion of Pretzel Time and at no time does Pretzel Time promise or guarantee that additional franchises will be offered  or  approved.  Such  decisions  will be made on a  case-to-case basis,  based on  factors  including,  but not  limited to the  availability  of suitable locations,  quality of standards maintained in the Franchisee's current Units,   the  impact  of  additional   locations  upon  the  operations  of  the Franchisee's  current Units, the geographical  distance between the Franchisee's existing and proposed  location,  the business  plan of Pretzel  Time,  national contracts  with  major  corporations,  the  population  of  the  area  near  the prospective  site,  the quality of the site,  and other  economic  and  business factors.  Under no  circumstances  is  Franchisee  entitled to demand or require Pretzel Time to grant to Franchisee a Franchise or a similar variation thereof.

The renewal fee is due and payable thirty (30) days prior to the renewal day.

         4.H.     PAYMENT BY ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER.

         Franchisee agrees to pay all Royalties,  Advertising Fund Fees, amounts due Pretzel Time for purchases by Franchisee from Pretzel Time or its Affiliates and other amounts which  Franchisee  owes to Pretzel Time via  electronic  funds transfer from Franchisee's general account,  which shall be initiated by Pretzel Time and any transfer fees shall be paid by Franchisee  every  Wednesday for the preceding week based upon the Net Revenues.  Franchisee herein agrees to execute and complete all necessary  documentation required by Pretzel Time to permit the wire transfer to Pretzel Time (in the form attached  hereto as Exhibit E or such other form as Pretzel Time shall accept). Under this procedure, Franchisee shall authorize  Pretzel  Time to initiate  debit  entries  and/or  credit  correction entries  to  Franchisee's   general  operating  bank  account  for  payments  of Royalties,  Advertising Fund Fees and other amounts payable under this Agreement and any late or interest  charges due thereon.  Franchisee  shall make the funds





available to Pretzel Time for  withdrawal by  electronic  transfer no later than one day prior to the due date for payment therefor.  The Royalty and Advertising Fund Fees amount actually  transferred from Franchisee's  account shall be based on the Unit's Net Revenues  indicated on the reports  submitted by Franchisee as required  hereunder.  If Franchisee  has not reported the Unit's Net Revenues to Pretzel  Time  for any week as  required  herein,  then  Pretzel  Time  shall be authorized  to  debit  Franchisee's  account  in an  amount  equal  to the  fees transferred from Franchisee's  account for the last reporting period for which a report of the Unit's Net  Revenues  was  provided  to Pretzel  Time as  required hereunder.  If,  at any  time,  Pretzel  Time  determines  that  Franchisee  has under-reported the Unit's Net Revenues, or underpaid Royalty or Advertising Fund Fees or other  amounts  due  hereunder,  Pretzel  Time  shall be  authorized  to initiate  immediately a debit to Franchisee's  account in the appropriate amount in  accordance  with the foregoing  procedure,  plus interest as provided for in this  Agreement.  Any  overpayment  shall be  credited to  Franchisee's  account through a credit  effective  as of the first week after  Franchisee  and Pretzel Time  determine  that such credit is due.  Notwithstanding  any  designation  by Franchisee, Pretzel Time shall have the sole discretion to apply any payments by Franchisee to any past  indebtedness  of Franchisee  for Royalty or  Advertising Fund Fees,  purchases from Pretzel Time and/or its  Affiliates,  interest or any other indebtedness,  including,  without  limitation,  payment of rental sums in arrears for the Unit.

         4.I.     LATE CHARGE AND INTEREST.

         To compensate Pretzel Time for the increased  administrative expense of handling late payments,  Pretzel Time may charge Franchisee a $50.00 late charge for each delinquent payment.  All Royalty and Advertising Fund Fees, amounts due for  purchases by  Franchisee  from Pretzel  Time or its  Affiliates,  and other amounts  which  Franchisee  owes to Pretzel  Time or its  Affiliates  shall bear interest  after  their due date at a rate equal to the  lesser of: (1)  eighteen percent (18%) per annum for the number of days which such payment is due; or (2) the highest  applicable  legal rate  permitted  by  applicable  law.  Franchisee acknowledges  that this  Section  shall  not  constitute  Pretzel  Time's or its Affiliates' agreement to accept such payments after they are due or a commitment by Pretzel  Time or its  Affiliates  to extend  credit to or  otherwise  finance operation of the Unit.  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of this Section  4.I., Franchisee  acknowledges and agrees that his failure to pay all amounts when due shall constitute grounds for termination of this Agreement.

5.       RENEWAL OF FRANCHISE TERM.

         5.A.     FRANCHISEE'S RIGHT TO A SUCCESSOR FRANCHISE.

         Upon the expiration of the initial term of this  Agreement,  Franchisee shall  have the one time  right to obtain a  successor  franchise  to  operate a Pretzel  Time Unit at the Site (a  "Successor  Franchise")  for a single term of five (5) years  immediately  following the expiration of the initial term of the Franchise upon giving Pretzel Time six (6) months notice prior to the expiration of the then current term if:

         7.C.     RELOCATION.

         In the event that  Franchisee's  lease is  terminated,  with or without fault of  Franchisee,  if the Site is damaged,  condemned or otherwise  rendered unusable as a Pretzel Time Unit in accordance with this Agreement, or if, in the judgment of Pretzel Time and  Franchisee,  there is a change in the character of the location of the Site sufficiently  detrimental to his business  potential to warrant its relocation,  Pretzel Time will not unreasonably  withhold permission for  relocation  of the  Unit  to  another  Site,  which  meets  Pretzel  Time's then-current  site  criteria,  subject to the rights of  existing  Pretzel  Time franchisees  under their  franchise  agreements  with Pretzel  Time.

10.      FRANCHISEE TRAINING.

         10.A.    INITIAL TRAINING.

         Franchisee  acknowledges and agrees that, while Pretzel Time's training program will provide  Franchisee  with the  fundamental  knowledge  necessary to operate a unit,  Franchisee  cannot  expect  success  unless he devotes his best personal efforts to the business and exercises good business judgment in dealing with customers,  suppliers, and employees.  Prior to the Unit's opening, Pretzel Time shall  furnish an initial  training  program on the  operation of a Pretzel Time Unit which shall take place at Pretzel Time's  headquarters  in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania,  or at a location  which will  provide the best  training  for the





Franchisee,  which may or may not be close to Pretzel Time's  headquarters.  The Franchisee agrees that he and his Unit Manager shall attend the initial training session held four (4) to eight (8) weeks prior to the Unit's  projected  opening date. Pretzel Time will not charge for the initial training of the Franchisee or if a corporation or partnership,  the Principal Owners of the Franchisee and the Unit  Manager.  All  incidental  expenses  relative  to the  required  training, including  travel  expenses,  hotel/motel  expenses,  and  meals  shall  be  the responsibility  of  the  Franchisee  while  attending  training.  Prior  to  the commencement  of the  operation  of the Unit,  the  manager  of the Unit  ("Unit Manager") and the  Franchisee or if a corporation or  partnership,  one Owner of the Franchisee as identified in Exhibit B, who will be personally overseeing the Unit shall attend and  successfully  complete the Pretzel Time initial  training program to the satisfaction of Pretzel Time.

         The  Franchisee  and his  Unit  Manager  must  satisfactorily  complete Pretzel  Time's  training as  determined  by Pretzel  Time, in its sole opinion, before  Franchisee is allowed to operate the Franchise.  If Pretzel Time, in its sole discretion, determines that Franchisee is unable to satisfactorily complete the  training  program,  Pretzel  Time  shall have the right to  terminate  this Agreement and no franchise fees shall be refunded.  The initial training program shall cover material aspects of the operation of a Pretzel Time Unit,  including financial   controls,   employee  relations,   food  preparation,   service  and operational techniques,  sampling, recipes and cooking procedures, marketing and public  relations,  cleanliness and maintenance  procedures,  and maintenance of Pretzel  Time  System  standards.  Franchisee  shall  receive  one  copy  of the Operations Manual, which cannot be reproduced, in whole or in part. In the event that  the  Franchisee's  copy  is  lost  destroyed  or  significantly   damaged, Franchisee  shall be  obligated  to obtain from Pretzel  Time,  at  Franchisee's expense a replacement copy of the Operations Manual.

         10.B.    EMPLOYEE TRAINING.

         Pretzel  Time may  provide  to  Franchisee,  at  Franchisee's  request, guidance in the selection of a Unit Manager and may provide periodic evaluations of  Franchisee's  Unit,  Managers  and  employees,  but  without  any  liability therefore to Pretzel Time. Franchisee shall hire all employees of the franchise, be exclusively  responsible for the terms of their employment and  compensation, and  implement a training  program for  employees of the  franchise.  Franchisee agrees  to  maintain  a staff  of  trained  employees  to  operate  the  Unit in compliance with Pretzel Time's standards.

         In the event the Unit Manager ceases to hold such full-time position at the  Unit,  Franchisee  shall  have  thirty  (30)  days in  which to  appoint  a substitute  or  replacement  Unit  Manager,  who must  attend  and  successfully complete,  to  Pretzel  Time's  satisfaction  the  initial  training  program as specified  above within sixty (60) days after  employment  as Unit  Manager.  If Pretzel  Time in its sole  discretion  determines  that the Unit  Manager or any subsequently  appointed Unit Manager has failed to  satisfactorily  complete the initial  training  program or any  additional  or  refresher  training  program, Franchisee  agrees to  immediately  hire a substitute  Unit Manager and promptly arrange  for such  person  to  complete  the  initial  training  program  to the satisfaction  of Pretzel Time.  Franchisee  agrees to notify Pretzel Time of any new  Unit  Managers  for the  Unit  within  seven  (7)  business  days of  their employment.  In the event  Franchisee  operates more than one (1) Unit, at least one (1)  trained and  competent  Unit  Manager  referred to above shall act as a full-time manager in each Territory. Franchisee shall keep Pretzel Time informed at all times of the identity of any Unit Manager(s) of the Unit.

         All Unit  Managers  of the Unit must  have  successfully  completed  an initial training program as specified by Pretzel Time at the sole expense of the Franchisee, including, but not limited to, salary and incidental travel expenses attendant to any training provided by Pretzel Time. Franchisee and Unit Managers who  successfully  complete  training will receive a Training  Certificate  from Pretzel Time.  Pretzel Time shall make training  available to Franchisee's  Unit Manager during Pretzel Time's regularly  scheduled training course. In no event, will  Pretzel Time be under any  obligation  to provide  individual  training to Franchisee's  Unit  Managers.  Franchisee  agrees that each Unit  Manager  shall participate at Franchisee's  expense in Pretzel Time's initial  training program and all other mandatory  training  programs which may subsequently be offered by Pretzel Time.

         10.C.  ON-SITE TRAINING.

         Additionally,   Pretzel   Time  will   provide   on-site   training  at Franchisee's  business  location for a period of five (5) days,  generally to be commenced  immediately  prior to  Franchisee's  day of opening and continued the first three (3) days of operation.  Franchisee  herein agrees to notify  Pretzel Time,  in writing,  of his opening  date  twenty (20) days prior  thereto.  This training  will include all  functions  required for the proper  operation of the franchise.

         Should Franchisee  request  additional  assistance from Pretzel Time in order to facilitate  the opening of the  Franchise,  and should Pretzel Time, in its discretion,  deem it necessary,  feasible and appropriate to comply with the request or should Pretzel Time determine that  additional  training is required, Franchisee  shall  reimburse  Pretzel Time at Pretzel  Time's then current daily training  service fee, for the expense of Pretzel Time providing such additional assistance and for its training  related  expenses,  which may include,  travel, room and board.

         10.D.    COMPANY GROWTH.

         Throughout  the  term of  this  Agreement,  Pretzel  Time  may  provide Franchisee  with  information  on company  growth and  operations as well as new





techniques developed to reduce costs and/or enhance sales or profits.

         10.E.    RETRAINING PROGRAMS.

         Pretzel  Time shall  provide  re-training  programs  at a  location  of Pretzel Time's choice from time to time for  experienced  franchisees  and their managers and/or employees.  Pretzel Time may charge fees for refresher  training courses  for  previously  trained  and  experienced  managers.  Fees for special programs will be based upon Pretzel Time's actual costs and attendance  shall be required. Attendance at retraining programs or seminars shall be at Franchisee's sole expense,  provided,  however,  that attendance will not be required at more than two (2) such  programs  in any  calendar  year and shall  not  collectively exceed ten (10) business days in duration during any calendar year.

         10.F.    OTHER GUIDANCE.

         Pretzel  Time may  advise  Franchisee  from  time to time of  operating problems of the Unit which come to Pretzel Time's attention and, at Franchisee's request but without any liability  therefore to Pretzel Time, Pretzel Time shall furnish to Franchisee guidance in connection with:                             (i)  Methods,  standards,   specifications  and  operating  procedures                utilized by Pretzel Time Units;

          (v)  Administrative, bookkeeping, accounting and general operating and                management procedures.

Pretzel Time will make no separate charge to  Franchisee  for  such  operating  assistance  as  Pretzel  Time  customarily provides.  From time to time, Pretzel Time may make special assistance  programs available to  Franchisee,  however,  Franchisee  will be required to pay the per diem fees and charges that Pretzel Time  establishes  from time to time for such special assistance programs.

11.      ADVERTISING AND OTHER PROMOTIONS.

         11.A.    PROVIDING OF ADVERTISING MATERIALS.

         Franchisee  and Pretzel Time agree and  recognize  the value of uniform advertising to the goodwill and public image of Pretzel Time Units. Pretzel Time has  instituted  and  maintains and  administers  an  advertising  fund for such advertising  or  public  relations   programs  as  Pretzel  Time,  in  its  sole discretion,  may deem  necessary  or  appropriate  to  advertise  or promote the Pretzel Time System,  nationally or regionally.  Pretzel Time will  periodically provide Franchisee with programs,  promotional  concepts,  and other information designed to enhance the operation of the  Franchise.  In addition,  Pretzel Time may  provide  optional  special  promotions  from time to time  which will be at Franchisee's cost, which may be mandatory.

         11.B.    CONTROL OF ADVERTISING PROGRAMS AND CONCEPTS.

         Pretzel Time shall direct all such programs,  with sole discretion over the creative concepts, materials,  endorsements, and media used therein, and the placement  and  allocation  thereof.   The  manner,   media  and  cost  of  such advertising,  public  relations  and  promotional  mailings  shall be solely and completely  within the  discretion of Pretzel Time.  Pretzel Time shall have the right to determine, in its sole discretion,  the target and market areas for the development  and  implementation  of such  programs.

         Franchisee  understands and  acknowledges  that the Advertising Fund is intended to maximize  recognition  of the Marks and  patronage  of Pretzel  Time Units.  Although  Pretzel Time will endeavor to utilize the Advertising  Fund to develop   advertising  and  marketing   materials  and  programs  and  to  place advertising that will benefit all Pretzel Time Units, Pretzel Time undertakes no obligation to ensure that  expenditures by the Advertising  Fund in or affecting any geographic area are  proportionate or equivalent to the contributions to the Advertising Fund by Pretzel Time Units operating in that geographic area or that any  Pretzel  Time  Units  will  benefit   directly  or  in  proportion  to  its contribution  to the  Advertising  Fund from the  development of advertising and marketing materials or the placement of Advertising.

Fees paid by  Franchisee  into the advertising  fund  shall  not  under any  circumstance  be used for the  general operating  expenses of Pretzel Time but shall and will be used  exclusively  for advertising  as outlined  herein.  Pretzel  Time may spend in any fiscal year an amount greater or less than the aggregate  contributions  of the  franchisees to the fund in that  year and  Pretzel  Time  may  make  loans to the fund  bearing reasonable  interest  to cover  any  deficits  of the fund and cause the fund to invest any surplus for future use by the fund. It is anticipated,  and it is the intent of Pretzel Time that all  contributions to the Fund shall be expended for advertising  and  promotional  purposes during Pretzel Time's fiscal year within which  contributions  are made.

All unspent monies on the date of termination  shall be distributed to Pretzel Time's  franchisees and Pretzel Time, its Affiliates and designees in proportion to their  respective  contributions  to the Advertising Fund upon the same terms and  conditions set forth herein upon thirty (30) days' prior written notice Franchisee.

         11.E.    FRANCHISEE'S REQUIRED ADVERTISING EXPENDITURES.

         In addition to any contributions by Franchisee to the Advertising Fund, Franchisee is required to spend on marketing and related programs such amount as is  required  pursuant  to the terms and  conditions  of  Franchisee's  lease or sublease.  Franchisee  acknowledges  such amounts will vary from lease to lease, and therefore, all Pretzel Time Unit franchisees will not be obligated to expend the same amount on local advertising and marketing of the Unit.

Franchisee  agrees to refrain  from any business or marketing practice  which may be  injurious  to the  business of Pretzel Time and the good will associated with the Marks and other Pretzel Time Units.  Prior to their use by  Franchisee,  all  press  releases,  literature,  and  samples  of all  local advertising, marketing, point-of-purchase, and related materials not prepared or previously  approved  by Pretzel  Time shall be  submitted  to Pretzel  Time for approval,  which shall not be unreasonably  withheld.  If written disapproval is not received within twenty (20) days from the date of receipt by Pretzel Time of such  materials,  Pretzel Time shall be deemed to have  approved the  materials.

         12.B.    CONFIDENTIALITY OF OPERATIONS MANUAL.

         Pretzel Time will make  available to Franchisee  during the term of the Franchise (1) copy of the Operations  Manual by loaning a copy of the Operations Manual to Franchisee. Franchisee acknowledges and agrees that all manuals loaned to Franchisee contain  confidential and proprietary  material and information of Pretzel  Time  provided  to  Franchisee  is to be  used  by  Franchisee  only in connection  with the  operation of the  franchised  Unit and other  Pretzel Time Units. The Operations Manual contains trade secrets and confidential information and will  remain the  property  of Pretzel  Time and shall be  returned to it on termination of this Agreement.  Franchisee  covenants not to reveal the contents of the Operations  Manual to  unauthorized  persons.  Franchisee may not, at any time,  copy the Operations  Manual,  in whole or in part,  either  physically or electronically. In the event Franchisee's copy of the Operations Manual is lost, destroyed or significantly damaged, Franchisee shall be obligated to obtain from Pretzel Time, at Pretzel Time's then applicable  charge,  a replacement  copy of the Operations Manual.

         12.C.    INCORPORATION OF OPERATIONS MANUAL INTO AGREEMENT.

         The  Operations  Manual's  specifications,   standards,  and  operating procedures  communicated to Franchisee in writing shall be deemed a part of this Agreement and are  incorporated  herein by  reference.  Such  Operations  Manual provisions and all reasonable  modifications shall be binding upon Franchisee to the same extent as if set forth verbatim in this Franchise  Agreement,  and such provisions  may be  changed  from  time to time by  Pretzel  Time,  in its  sole discretion,  provided that changes are  reasonably  designed to enhance  Pretzel Time's  Products,  the Pretzel  Time  System,  or  franchise  operation  and are uniformly  applied  with  respect  to all  franchisees.  Any  administrative  or financial  Section set forth in the  Operations  Manual shall be in addition to, and not in derogation or limitation  of, any right or remedy  granted to Pretzel Time  under  the  Franchise  Agreement,  the  Operations  Manual,  or any  other document,  or  otherwise  available  to  Pretzel  Time,  at  law  or in  equity, including,  without limitation,  the right to terminate a franchise in the event of certain defaults or delinquencies.

         12.D.    MODIFICATIONS/UPDATES OF OPERATIONS MANUAL.

          Franchisee  understands  and agrees  that the  Pretzel  Time System is constantly  being  modified  and  improved,  and  that  such  modifications  and improvements  require  changes  from time to time in the  system of  operations. Franchisee  further  agrees  to  accept  and  comply  with  such  modifications, revisions,  and additions to the Pretzel Time System and Operations Manual which Pretzel Time in the good faith exercise of its judgment believes to be desirable and reasonably necessary in the time period indicated by Pretzel Time.

         Franchisee  agrees  that  Standards  may be  periodically  modified  by Pretzel  Time and that such  modifications  may  obligate  Franchisee  to invest additional capital in the Unit and/or incur higher operating costs. Pretzel Time will not obligate  Franchisee to invest  additional  capital at a time when such investment cannot in Pretzel Time's reasonable  judgment be amortized during the remaining term of this  Agreement.  Franchisee  hereby agrees that standards and specifications  prescribed  from  time  to  time in the  Operations  Manual,  or otherwise  communicated  to  Franchisee  in  writing  or  electronically,  shall constitute provisions of this Agreement as if fully set forth herein.

13.      UNIT IMAGE AND OPERATION.

         13.A.    CONDITION AND APPEARANCE OF UNIT.

         Franchisee agrees that:

                  (1) neither the Unit nor the Site will be used for any purpose          other than the operation of a Pretzel Time Unit in full compliance with          this Agreement or other agreements with Pretzel Time; and

                  (2)  Franchisee  will maintain the condition and appearance of          the Unit, its equipment, furnishings, fixtures, and signs in accordance          with the  specifications  and standards of Pretzel Time and  consistent          with  the  image  of a  Pretzel  Time  Unit  as a  first-class,  clean,          sanitary,  attractive and efficiently  operated food service  business;          and

                  (3)  Franchisee  will  perform  such  maintenance  (including,          without limitation,  maintenance  procedures and routines which Pretzel          Time  prescribes  from  time  to  time)  with  respect  to  the  decor,





         equipment, fixtures,  furnishings,  vehicles, and signs of the Unit and          the Site,  as may be required or directed by Pretzel  Time from time to          time to maintain such condition,  appearance,  and efficient operation,          including, without limitation:

          (a)  continuous  and thorough  cleaning and sanitation of the interior                and exterior of the Unit;

          (b)  thorough repainting and redecorating of the interior and exterior                of the Unit and/or the Site at reasonable intervals;

          (c)  interior and exterior repair of the Unit and/or Site; and

          (d)  repair or replacement of damaged, worn out or obsolete                   furnishings,  equipment,  fixtures  and signs,  provided  that                   Pretzel  Time  will not  require  Franchisee  to  replace  any                   obsolete equipment unless Pretzel Time has initiated a program                   to  replace  such  equipment  as it becomes  necessary  in its                   company-owned Pretzel Time Units; and

                  (4) Franchisee  will not make any material  alterations to the          Site or to the appearance of the Unit as originally developed,  without          prior approval in writing by Pretzel Time; and

                  (5) Upon notice from Pretzel  Time,  Franchisee  shall remodel          and conform  Franchisee's  building design, Trade Dress, color schemes,          and  presentation  of Marks to Pretzel Time's then current public image          within a  reasonable  amount of time,  which  shall not  exceed six (6)          months.  Such a remodeling may include extensive  structural changes to          the Unit  fixtures and  improvements  as well as such other  changes as          Pretzel Time may direct and Franchisee  shall  undertake such a program          promptly upon notice from Pretzel Time;  provided the remodeling  shall          not be  required  until  such time as  Pretzel  Time has  commenced  or          completed a similar  program in at least fifty  percent  (50%) of those          Pretzel Time Units owned and operated by Pretzel Time. This requirement          shall not apply in the  event  notice  from  Pretzel  Time is  received          during the last year of the term hereof or the term of any agreement by          virtue of which Franchisee occupies the Unit.

         In addition to Pretzel Time's rights to terminate this Agreement as set forth herein,  if Franchisee  does not maintain the condition and  appearance of the Unit as herein  required,  Pretzel  Time,  may,  upon not less than ten (10) days'  written  notice  (or, in cases of health or  sanitation  hazards or other public endangerment, immediately on oral or written notice) to Franchisee:

          (i)  arrange  for  the  necessary  cleaning  or  sanitation,   repair,                remodeling, upgrading, painting or decorating; or

          (ii) replace the necessary fixtures, furnishings, equipment, signs.

         If Franchisee  fails or refuses to initiate  within ten (10) days after receipt  of  a  notice  that  the  general  state  of  repair,  appearance,  and cleanliness of your store does not meet Pretzel Time's standards, and thereafter continue in good faith and with due  diligence a bona fide  program to undertake and complete required  maintenance or refurbishing,  Pretzel Time has the right, but is not  obligated,  to enter upon the  premises  of the Unit and effect such maintenance and  refurbishing on Franchisee's  behalf,  and Franchisee shall pay the entire cost thereof to Pretzel Time on demand.

         13.B.  UNIT MENU.

         Franchisee  agrees that the Unit shall offer for sale all  Products and no other  products,  which Pretzel Time, in its sole  discretion,  may authorize and/or require from time to time for the Unit.  Franchisee  agrees that the Unit shall not offer for sale or sell any  Products  or  services at or from the Unit which have not been  approved in writing by Pretzel Time or use the Site or Unit for any purpose  other than the  operation  of a Pretzel  Time Unit.  Franchisee agrees that the Unit shall not sell any  Products at, from or away from the Site until Pretzel Time, in its sole discretion,  has approved the same, provided the foregoing  shall not limit  Franchisee  to sample in front of the lease  line as limited in  Franchisee's  lease.  Pretzel Time  reserves the right to change the types of  authorized  Products and require  Franchisee to offer to sell and sell the  new,  modified  or  substituted  Products.  Pretzel  Time may  develop  new Products,  methods  of  operations,  and  standards  and may  provide  you  with information about developments.  Franchisee also acknowledges and agrees that if Pretzel Time requires the Unit to use new or  substitute  products not currently offered at Pretzel  Time  Units,  Franchisee  agrees to offer such  Products  in compliance  with  Pretzel  Time's   specifications,   standards  and  procedures prescribed in the  Operations  Manuals or otherwise in writing and to diligently pursue  obtaining  any  permits  and  take  such  actions  (including,   without limitation,  constructing  improvements  and  acquiring  fixtures,  furnishings, equipment,  supplies, and materials) required to offer such Products. Franchisee acknowledges  and  understands  that such  modifications  to the  Products to be offered  by the Unit  may  require  Franchisee  to incur  additional  costs  and expenses to operate the Unit, including, without limitation, the purchase and/or lease of additional or substitute furnishings,  furniture, fixtures or equipment and Franchisee agrees to incur such expenses in connection therewith.

         13.C.    ADHERENCE TO APPROVED ITEMS.





         The  reputation  and goodwill of all Pretzel Time Units are based upon, and can only be maintained by, the sale of  distinctive,  high-quality  Products and the  presentation,  packaging  and service of Products in an  efficient  and appealing  manner.  Pretzel  Time has  developed  and shall  continue to develop certain  proprietary food products which will be prepared by or for Pretzel Time according to Pretzel Time's recipes and formulas. Pretzel Time has developed and shall continue to develop  standards and  specifications  for fresh  hand-rolled pretzels, frozen pretzels,  pretzel toppings,  beverages and other healthy snack food  products,   materials  and  supplies   incorporated  in  or  used  in  the preparation, baking, or serving of Products authorized by Pretzel Time. The need for quality and quantity control in the Products offered for sale at the Unit is acknowledged  by  Franchisee.  All  Products  offered by  Franchisee  must be of uniform  quality and quantity  and offered for sale to the public in  accordance with Pretzel Time's  specifications  as set forth in Pretzel  Time's  Operations Manual and as may be amended from time to time.

         Pretzel  Time has  approved  and shall  review and  continue to approve suppliers and  distributors  of the  foregoing  Products,  supplies,  materials, equipment,  fixtures  and  machines  that  meet  Pretzel  Time's  standards  and requirements  including,  without  limitation,  quality,  quantity and portions, prices,  output requirements,  distribution methods and locations,  standards of service, financial capability,  customer service and other criteria.  Franchisee agrees that minimum standards for items of inventory,  Products,  machines,  and equipment  may  be  recognized  by  brand  name  rather  than  by  technical  or engineering description.

         Franchisee  agrees  that  it  will  use  all  equipment  and  Products, including, without limitation, food products,  smallwares,  equipment, and paper products as designated by Pretzel Time and shall purchase Pretzel Time's private label  food  products,   materials,  supplies  and  proprietary  food  products, ingredients,  spices, sauces, mixes,  beverages,  materials and supplies used in the  preparation of Products  developed by or for Pretzel Time or its Affiliates whether or not pursuant to a special recipe or formula or bearing the Marks only from Pretzel  Time,  its  Affiliates  or  non-affiliated  sources  designated by Pretzel Time.  Franchisee  further agrees to purchase only from distributors and suppliers  approved  or  required by Pretzel  Time.  Franchisee  agrees that the approved Products, equipment, smallwares, and inventory used on the premises may alter from time to time as Pretzel Time reasonably deems  necessary.  Franchisee agrees to offer for sale only those  Products  approved  by Pretzel  Time and no others without the prior written approval of Pretzel Time. Franchisee shall not, after receipt in writing of any modification of an approved or required supplier or distributor,  manufacturer  of equipment,  products,  materials,  supplies or other items  reorder any product  from any  supplier or  distributor  that is no longer  approved.  Pretzel Time may approve or require a single  distributor  or supplier  for any  Products,  materials or supplies and may approve or require a distributor or supplier only as to certain products, materials and supplies, and such approval may be temporary pending a further  evaluation of such distributor or supplier by Pretzel Time. Pretzel Time may concentrate  purchases with one or more distributors or suppliers to obtain lower prices and/or advertising support and/or  services for the benefit of Pretzel Time, the Pretzel Time System and/or Pretzel Time Units.

         Pretzel Time will loan to Franchisee a list of approved  brand Products for use during the term of this  Franchise  Agreement  at the  initial  training session.  Franchisee  agrees to not copy the list.  Franchisee will,  during the term of this Agreement and after its  termination  or  expiration,  maintain the list  and its  contents  in  strict  confidence,  and  upon  the  expiration  or termination of this Franchise Agreement,  whichever is earlier, will immediately return it to Pretzel Time.  Pretzel Time shall promptly provide  Franchisee with any  amendments to the  designated  list of inventory of available  Products and supplies to be carried and sold at Franchisee's  location.  Franchisee  shall at all times  maintain an adequate  inventory of approved  Products  sufficient  in quality and variety to realize the full potential of the Unit.

         13.D.    EXCEPTION PROCESS.

         If   Franchisee   proposes  to  purchase   materials  or  supplies  not theretofore  approved by Pretzel Time as meeting its  specifications,  or from a supplier or  distributor  not  previously  approved by Pretzel Time,  Franchisee shall first notify Pretzel Time and request  Pretzel  Time's  approval using the special exception form provided to Franchisee in its Operations  Manual, and pay any reasonable fees that Pretzel Time designates therefor.  Further,  Franchisee agrees to use all forms  specified and developed by Pretzel Time for  requesting any exceptions in products or suppliers.  Pretzel Time may require submission of sufficient information and samples to determine whether such materials, supplies or suppliers meet its specifications as well as financial  information regarding the  supplier.  Pretzel Time will advise  Franchisee  within a  reasonable  time whether such

materials or supplies meet its specifications.  Pretzel Time does not maintain a formal criteria for approving materials,  supplies or suppliers.  All approvals, disapprovals  and  revocations of approval of suppliers will be  communicated to Franchisee,  in writing,  and shall be in the sole  discretion  of Pretzel Time. Franchisee  must  comply  with  the  following  conditions  in  order  to seek a substitution for a Pretzel Time approved Product:

                  (1) Franchisee  shall submit a written request to Pretzel Time





                  for approval of a non-approved supplier or product;

                  (2)  Franchisee  and  supplier  shall  demonstrate  to Pretzel                   Time's  reasonable  satisfaction that it is able to supply the                   commodity  which  meets  Pretzel  Time's   specifications   to                   Franchisee; and

                  (3)  The  supplier   shall   demonstrate   to  Pretzel  Time's                   reasonable  satisfaction that the supplier is of good standing                   in the  business  community  with  respect  to  its  financial                   soundness and the  reliability  of its product and service and                   shall  request  in  writing  to  Pretzel  Time to be  named an                   approved supplier.

         13.E.  PROMOTIONAL ALLOWANCES.

         Franchisee  acknowledges  and agrees that Pretzel Time may, in its sole discretion,  collect  and  retain all  allowances,  benefits,  credits,  monies, payments  or  rebates   (collectively   "Promotional   Rebates"),   whether  for promotional,  advertising  or other  purposes,  offered to Franchisee or Pretzel Time or its Affiliates by manufacturers,  suppliers and distributors  based upon Franchisee's  purchases of Products or other products and materials.  Franchisee assigns to Pretzel  Time or its designee all of  Franchisee's  right,  title and interest  in and to any and  all  such  Promotional  Allowances  and  authorizes Pretzel  Time or its  designee to collect any such  Promotional  Allowances  for remission to the general operating funds of Pretzel Time.

14.      FRANCHISEE OPERATIONS.

         14.A.    MANAGEMENT.

         Franchisee agrees that he will at all times faithfully,  honestly,  and diligently  perform his obligations  hereunder,  that he will continuously exert his best efforts and shall  continually  train and  supervise  his  personnel to Pretzel Time's  reasonable  standards,  in  furtherance  of the mutual  business interests of both Pretzel Time and Franchisee and that he will not engage in any other business or activity that may conflict with his obligations  hereunder.  A Unit  shall be under  the  direct,  on-premises  supervision  of a  trained  and competent  Franchisee  or a  trained  and  competent  employee  acting as a Unit Manager  at  all  times.  Franchisee  shall  remain  active  in  overseeing  the operations of the Unit  conducted  under the  supervision  of such Unit Manager. Pretzel  Time shall have the right to deal with the Unit  Manager and  assistant managers on matters  pertaining to the  day-to-day  operations of, and reporting requirements  for the Unit.  Franchisee shall be required to notify Pretzel Time within seven (7) business days of changing Unit Managers.  Franchisee shall hire all employees of the Unit and shall be exclusively  responsible for the terms of their  employment and compensation and for the proper training of such employees in the operation of the Unit.

         If the Unit at any time is not being  managed by you or a Unit  Manager who shall have satisfactorily completed Pretzel Time's training program, Pretzel Time is  authorized,  but is not  required to  immediately  appoint a Manager to maintain  the  operations  of the Unit for you.  Pretzel  Time has the  right to change a reasonable fee for such management  services,  not to exceed our costs, and to cease to provide such  management  services at any time.  Pretzel  Time's right to manage a Unit and obtain  reimbursement  for costs also  applies in the event of your death or disability.

         14.B.  SUFFICIENT WORKING CAPITAL.

         Franchisee shall maintain an adequate sales force to serve properly all customers,  and shall  carry at all times a stock of  merchandise  of such size, character,  quality and price to produce the maximum return to Franchisee and so as to produce all of the gross  revenue  which may be produced by such manner of operation.

         14.C.  FILING OF OPERATIONS AND SALES REPORTS.

If the gross sales report is not submitted as herein  specified,  Pretzel Time may, at its option,  charge a late fee of $50.00 to Franchisee.  There will only be one late fee for each late report.

         14.D.    EMPLOYEE DRESS AND CUSTOMER SERVICE.

         The  presentation  of an uniform  image is  essential  to a  successful franchise  system.  Franchisee  shall cause all  employees of  Franchisee  while working  at the  franchise  location  to dress  appropriately  (in the  specific uniform  approved and  designated  by Pretzel  Time) in keeping with the Pretzel Time image,  as Pretzel Time may designate  from time to time, to present a neat and clean  appearance  and to render  confident  and  courteous  service  to the Franchise's customers.

         14.E.  COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND GOOD BUSINESS PRACTICES.

         Franchisee  shall secure and maintain in force in his name all required licenses,  permits,  and  certificates  relating to the conduct of his  business pursuant to this  Agreement.  Franchisee  will  conduct the  Franchise in strict compliance  with  all  applicable  laws,  ordinances,   regulations,  and  other requirements  of any federal,  state,  county,  municipal  or other  government, including,   without  limitation,  those  laws  and  regulations  pertaining  to preparation,  purchase  and  handling of food  products,  occupational  hazards,





health,  safety and sanitation,  worker's compensation  insurance,  unemployment insurance,  and  withholding  and payment of all taxes.  While  Pretzel Time may advise  Franchisee  as  a  courtesy  on  any  applicable  laws,  ordinances,  or regulations,  Pretzel Time  undertakes  no duty to do so and  Franchisee  hereby acknowledges  it is Franchisee's  sole duty to inquire  regarding and concerning all laws,  ordinances,  and  regulations  affecting  the Unit,  its  operations, employees and Franchisee.

         Franchisee shall in all dealings with its customers, suppliers, Pretzel Time, and public officials adhere to high standards of honesty,  integrity, fair dealing and ethical conduct.  Franchisee  agrees to refrain from any business or advertising  practice which may be injurious to the business of Pretzel Time and the goodwill associated with the Marks and other Pretzel Time Units.

         Franchisee  shall notify  Pretzel  Time within three (3) business  days after the commencement of any action, suit, proceeding or issuance of any order, writ, injunction, award or court decree which may adversely affect the operation or financial  condition of Franchisee or the unit or immediately  notify Pretzel Time of any notice of health or sanitation violation.

         14.F.    PAYMENT OF TAXES.

         Franchisee  shall be  solely  responsible  for  payment  of all  taxes, including, but not limited to, real estate, sales, payroll,  franchise,  income, personal  property,  and gross  receipts taxes which are assessed as a result of Franchisee's operation of the Franchise.

         14.G.    SALE OF PRODUCT.

         Franchisee agrees not to sell or offer to sell any materials, supplies, or  inventory  used in the  preparation  of any of the  Products  other  than to Pretzel  Time and that he shall  not  sell,  dispense,  give  away or  otherwise provide without Pretzel Time's prior written consent any product except by means of retail sales in the  franchise  location.  Franchisee  may only sell finished Products  and may not sell any Products to any person or entity  purchasing  the Products for resale.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  Franchisee may offer free samples of  Products  at or  directly  in front of the Unit to retail  customers only.

         14.H.    COOPERATION.

         Franchisee  agrees that he shall  cooperate with Pretzel Time in taking any action, or refraining from any action, which in the judgment of Pretzel Time is  necessary or desirable to promote and enhance the quality of the products of the Franchise location, the service provided by the Franchisee,  or the image of the Franchise in the community.

         14.I.    INSURANCE.

         Franchisee shall maintain at Franchisee's expense, in form, amounts and with insurers  satisfactory  to Pretzel Time,  which  insurers must have an A.M. Best  Company  rating of "A-" or better and naming  Pretzel  Time an  additional insured,  insurance  against all types of public  liability with personal injury coverage and property damage coverage. In addition to coverage as aforesaid such insurance  shall  include  coverages as set forth in the  Operations  Manual and shall contain a provision  obligating  all insurers to provide a written  notice Pretzel Time of any  cancellation  or  modification  of coverage at least thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of such modification or cancellation.

         The insurance afforded by the policy or policies  respecting  liability shall  not be  limited  in any  way by  reason  of any  insurance  which  may be maintained  by  Pretzel  Time.  Within  sixty  (60) days of the  signing of this Agreement,  but in no event later than the date on which Franchisee  acquires an interest in the real  property  (by lease or  purchase) on which it will develop and operate the Franchise,  a Certificate of Insurance  showing  compliance with the foregoing  requirements shall be furnished by Franchisee to Pretzel Time for approval.  Such certificate shall state that said policy or policies will not be canceled or altered  without at least thirty (30) days prior  written  notice to Pretzel Time and shall reflect proof of payment of premiums. Maintenance of such insurance  and the  performance  by  Franchisee  of the  obligations  under this Section shall not relieve Franchisee of liability under the indemnity  provision set forth in this  Agreement.  Minimum  limits as required above may be modified from time to time, as conditions require by written notice to Franchisee.

         Should  Franchisee not procure and maintain such insurance  coverage as required  by Pretzel  Time,  Pretzel  Time  shall have the right and  authority, without any obligation to do so, immediately procure such insurance coverage and to charge same to Franchisee,  which charges  together with a reasonable fee for expenses incurred by Pretzel Time in connection with such procurement,  shall be payable by Franchisee immediately upon notice.

         Franchisee  shall fully  cooperate  with Pretzel Time in its efforts to obtain  such  insurance  policies,  promptly  execute  all forms or  instruments required to obtain or maintain such insurance policies, allow inspections of the Unit or vehicles  which are  required to obtain and maintain  insurance  and pay Pretzel Time on demand for any costs or premiums.

         14.J.    SUGGESTED RETAIL PRICES.

         Pretzel  Time  may  from  time to time  advise  or  offer  guidance  to Franchisee  relative to prices for Products  offered for sale by Franchisee that in Pretzel Time's judgment  constitute good business practice.  Franchisee shall not be  obligated  to accept any such advice or guidance and shall have the sole right  to  determine  and to sell  products  at any  price  that it  determines.





Whenever Pretzel Time recommends a retail price, such  recommendations are based on Pretzel  Time's  experience  concerning  all factors that enter into a proper price, but such recommendation is in no manner binding on Franchisee and no such advice or guidance  shall be deemed or construed to impose upon  Franchisee  any obligation  to charge any  fixed,  minimum  or  maximum  prices for any  product offered for sale by the Franchise.  Pretzel Time reserves the right to advertise retail  prices of Pretzel Time  Products,  provided  that such retail prices are qualified as "suggested." The parties understand and agree that such advertising shall not be  construed  as  requiring  Franchisee  to adhere to such prices but Franchisee shall have complete freedom to establish retail prices.

15.      ACCOUNTING, REPORTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

         15.A.  ESTABLISHMENT OF ACCOUNTING SYSTEM.

         Franchisee  shall  establish at his own expense a complete and accurate bookkeeping,  accounting,  record keeping and data processing system prepared in accordance with generally accepted  accounting  principles and conforming to the requirements and formats that Pretzel Time prescribes from time to time. Pretzel Time shall provide  Franchisee with forms on which to maintain certain sales and operational  data.  Franchisee  shall furnish to Pretzel Time on said forms that Pretzel Time prescribes from time to time:

         (i) On Tuesday of each week,  a report on the Unit's net  revenues  and          sales and operations for the previous week;

         (ii) Every six calendar month period,  a balance sheet and a profit and          loss statement for the Unit for the previous  semi-annual  period and a          year to-date  statement  of  financial  condition as of the end of such          previous period; and

         (iii) Within  thirty (30) days after  Franchisee's  year end, an annual financial report.

The reports  required in Section 15.A. (ii) and (iii) if not audited,  should be signed  by the  Franchisee  or its  financial  officer,  attesting  that (1) the reports are true and accurate,  (2) they are prepared in accordance with GAPP on a basis  consistent  with prior periods,  (3) they fully describe and completely disclose the information sought, and (4) the signer has made diligent efforts to ascertain the truth and completeness of the information.

         15.B.   MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS.

         Franchisee  agrees, at all times, he shall keep and maintain  adequate, accurate,  true, and proper records, books, reports, data, and accounts relative to the  franchise  in the English  language  and in  accordance  with  generally accepted accounting principles, and retain the records for a period of three (3) years  after  the date they  were  prepared,  from  which  there may be  readily determined the  information  required in the operating  reports to be filed with Pretzel Time. Such records include, without limitation, daily cash reports, cash receipts  journal  and general  ledger,  cash  disbursements  journal and weekly payroll register,  monthly bank statements and daily deposit slips and cancelled checks;  tax returns,  supplier  invoices,  dated cash  register  tapes,  weekly inventories, sales reports, financial statements and tax returns.

         Franchisee hereby authorizes  Pretzel Time to utilize the data supplied by  Franchisee  under this  Section  in any  publication,  discovery  statement, Offering  Circular,  or  advertisements  related  to the sale of  Franchises  or related  entities  by Pretzel  Time,  anywhere,  at any time,  without  specific compensation therefor.

16.      AUDITS AND INSPECTIONS.

         16.A.    AUDITS.

         Pretzel  Time or its  designee  shall have the right at any time during business  hours and without prior notice to  Franchisee,  to inspect,  audit and copy or the right to cause to be  inspected,  audited and copied,  the  business records,  bookkeeping and accounting  records,  sales and income tax records and returns and other records of the Franchised Business,  including but not limited to,  daily  cash  reports,  cash  receipts  journal  and  general  ledger,  cash disbursements  journal and weekly payroll register,  monthly bank statements and daily deposit slips and cancelled checks; tax returns,  supplier invoices, dated cash register tapes, weekly inventories, sales reports, financial statements and tax returns and the books and records of any  corporation or  partnership  which holds the Franchise  including the personal financial records and tax returns of the Franchisee during and after the term of the Franchise Agreement.  Franchisee agrees to maintain on the premises  all sales and  operational  information  for four weeks.

         Any such  inspection  or audit will take place at a time which will not interfere with  Franchisee's  normal business.  Franchisee shall fully cooperate with Pretzel Time's representatives and independent accountants hired by Pretzel Time to conduct any such inspection or audit.  If Pretzel Time deems  necessary, Franchisee shall deliver to Pretzel Time or its designated  agents copies of all bookkeeping  records not already in the  possession of Pretzel  Time,  including customer  records,  cash  register  tapes,  sales and  purchase  records and tax records,  to enable Pretzel Time or its representative or designee to adequately audit Franchisee's  gross sales.  Franchisee hereby waives any right to withhold tax records relative to the Franchise as privileged information. Each report and





financial  statement  shall be signed and verified by  Franchisee  in the manner Pretzel Time prescribes.  Pretzel Time reserves the right to require  Franchisee to have audited or reviewed financial statements prepared on an annual basis.

         In the event  that an audit  discloses  that  Franchisee's  actual  net revenues exceed  Franchisee's  reported net revenues by two percent (2%) or more for any thirty day  period,  Franchisee  is  obligated  to pay to Pretzel  Time, within  fifteen (15) days after receipt of the  inspection or audit report,  the royalty of seven percent (7%) and the  Advertising  Fund Fee of one percent (1%) of the amount of such  understatement  plus interest from the date such payments were originally due. The audit will be conducted at the expense of Pretzel Time, provided that if an audit  disclosed an  understatement  of two percent (2%), as described above,  Franchisee will bear the cost of the audit,  including without limitation,  the charges of attorneys  and any  independent  accountants,  their travel   expenses,   room  and  board,   and   compensation  of  Pretzel  Time's representatives  and  independent  accountants.  Providing  that in no case will Franchisee be obligated to pay more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) for such inspection  or audit  costs.  The  foregoing  remedies  shall be in  addition to Pretzel Time's other remedies and rights under this Agreement or applicable law.

         16.B.    RIGHT OF ENTRY AND INSPECTION.

         To determine  whether  Franchisee  and the Unit are complying with this Agreement and with all Pretzel Time's  standards and operations as prescribed by Pretzel Time,  Pretzel Time or its designated agents shall have the right at any reasonable time and without prior notice to Franchisee to:

         a.  Inspect the Unit;

         b. Observe,  photograph  and video tape the Unit's  operations for such          consecutive or intermittent periods as Pretzel Time deems necessary;

         c. Remove  samples of any  Products,  materials or supplies for testing and analysis;

         d.  Interview personnel of the Unit;

         e.  Interview customers of the Unit; and

         f. Inspect and copy any books,  records and  documents  relating to the          operation  of the Unit.  Franchisee  agrees  to  cooperate  fully  with          Pretzel Time in connection with any such inspections, observations,  photographing,  video  taping,  Product  removal and  interviews. Franchisee  shall present to his customers  such comment or evaluation  forms as Pretzel Time periodically  prescribes and shall  participate  and/or request his customers  to  participate  in any surveys  performed by or on behalf of Pretzel Time. At the conclusion of his inspection,  Pretzel Time's field  representative shall prepare a written report which shall contain all of his  observations  and conclusions.  If the field representative  determines that a condition amounting to a default of this Agreement has occurred or exists,  this conclusion shall be promptly communicated to Franchisee and Pretzel Time.

17.      TRANSFER, ASSIGNMENT AND REPURCHASE.

         17.A.  BY PRETZEL TIME.

         This Agreement is fully transferable by Pretzel Time and shall inure to the benefit of any  assignee,  transferee  or other legal  successor  to Pretzel Time's interest  herein.  If Pretzel Time's assignee will perform any of Pretzel Time's obligations under this Agreement,  then that assignee must be financially capable of performing  those  obligations and the assignee must expressly assume and agree to perform  them.  Franchisee  agrees that Pretzel Time shall have the right,  from time to time, to delegate the  performance of any portion or all of its obligations and duties under this Agreement.

         17.B.  BY FRANCHISEE.

         Franchisee  understands  and  acknowledges  that the  rights and duties created by this Franchise Agreement are personal to Franchisee (or if Franchisee is a  corporation  or  partnership,  to its  Owners) and that  Pretzel  Time has granted the Franchise to Franchisee in reliance upon Pretzel Time's  perceptions of the individual or collective character,  skill, aptitude,  attitude, business ability and  financial  capacity of  Franchisee  (or its  Owners).  Accordingly, Franchisee agrees no Transfer shall be made without Pretzel Time's prior written approval.  Any Transfer  without such approval shall constitute a breach of this Agreement  and shall be void and of no  effect.  Pretzel  Time's  consent to the assignment  shall  neither  constitute  a  novation  or change  in  Franchisee's obligations under this agreement,  nor constitute a waiver of any claims Pretzel Time may have  against  Franchisee  (or its  Owners)  nor be  deemed a waiver of Pretzel Time's right to demand the transferee's exact compliance with all of the terms or conditions of this Agreement.

         17.C.  CONDITIONS FOR APPROVAL OF TRANSFER.

         If  Franchisee  is in full  compliance  with this  Agreement  (and,  if Franchisee is a corporation or  partnership,  its Owners are in full  compliance with this Agreement),  Pretzel Time shall not unreasonably withhold its approval of a Transfer that meets all of the following requirements:

         (1) The  transferee  and its  Owners  must  meet  Pretzel  Time's  then          applicable  standards for Pretzel Time Unit  franchisees  and must have          had sufficient business experience,  aptitude,  and financial resources          to operate the Unit;





         (2) Franchisee has paid such royalty,  advertising  fund fees,  amounts          owed for purchases by Franchisee  from Pretzel Time and its  Affiliates          and all other amounts owed to Pretzel Time or its  Affiliates and third          party  creditors and shall have  submitted to Pretzel Time all required          reports and statements;

         (3)  Franchisee or the  transferee has paid Pretzel Time's then current          transfer fee to defray expenses  Pretzel Time incurs in connection with          the  transfer,  except that if the  proposed  Transfer  is, to or among          Owners of Franchisee, this provision shall not apply;

         (4) The  Transferee  and/or its Unit  Manager  have  agreed to complete          Pretzel  Time's  training  program to Pretzel Time's  satisfaction  and          prior to the date of transfer;

         (5) The  Transferee  has  agreed  to be bound by all of the  terms  and          conditions of this Agreement and executes a current Franchise Agreement          and other franchise documents, a sublease agreement,  if any, and other          documents required by Pretzel Time;

         (6) Franchisee  (and its  transferring  Owners) have executed a general          release,  in form  satisfactory  to Pretzel Time, of any and all claims          against Pretzel Time and its Affiliates and their officers,  directors,          employees and agents;

         (7) Pretzel Time has approved the material terms and conditions of such          Transfer,  including,  without limitation,  that the price and terms of          payment are not so burdensome as to affect  adversely the  transferee's          operation of the Unit; provided,  however, that Pretzel Time's approval          of such Transfer does not ensure the transferee's  success as a Pretzel          Time Unit  franchisee,  nor should  the  transferee  rely upon  Pretzel          Time's  approval  of such  Transfer in  determining  whether to acquire          Franchisee's  Pretzel Time Unit; (8) If Franchisee  (and/or its Owners)          finances  any  part of the  sale  price  of the  transferred  interest,          Franchisee  and/or its Owners have agreed that all  obligations  of the          transferee  under or pursuant to any  promissory  notes,  agreements or          security  interests  reserved by Franchisee or its Owners in the assets          of the Unit or the Premises shall be  subordinate  to the  transferee's          obligations  to pay royalty and service  fees and other  amounts due to          Pretzel  Time and its  Affiliates  and  otherwise  to comply  with this          Agreement;

         (9) Franchisee (and its Owners) have executed a noncompetition covenant          in favor of Pretzel Time and the transferee agreeing that, for a period          of twelve (12) months commencing on the effective date of the Transfer,          Franchisee,  its  Owners  and  members  of the  immediate  families  of          Franchisee  and each of its Owners will not hold any direct or indirect          interest  as  a  disclosed  or  beneficial  owner,  investor,  partner,          director,  officer manager,  employee,  consultant,  representative  or          agent, or in any other capacity,  in a Competitive  Business located or          operating  within  three (3) miles of the Unit,  and  within  three (3)          miles of any other Pretzel Time Unit;

         (10) If consent is required, the lessor of the Premises consents to the          assignment or sublease of the Premises to the transferee;

         (11)  Franchisee  has complied with all of its  obligations  to Pretzel          Time, its Affiliates,  suppliers,  and distributors,  and Franchisee is          not in default under this Agreement or any other Agreement with Pretzel          Time or Pretzel Time's Affiliates;

         (12)  All  improvements,  including  refurbishings,   remodelings,  new          equipment must be made prior to the Transfer; and

         (13)  Franchisee  (and its Owners) has agreed that he will not directly          or  indirectly  at any time or in any manner  (except  with  respect to          Pretzel Time Units owned and operated by Franchisee)  identify  himself          or any  business  as a current or former  Pretzel  Time  Unit,  or as a          franchisee,  licensee or dealer of Pretzel Time or its Affiliates,  use          any Mark, any colorable imitation thereof or other indicia of a Pretzel          Time Unit in any manner or for any  purpose or utilize  for any purpose          any tradename,  trade or service mark or other  commercial  symbol that          suggests or indicates a connection or association  with Pretzel Time or          its Affiliates.

         17.D.    TRANSFER TO A WHOLLY-OWNED CORPORATION.

         Notwithstanding Section 17.B., if Franchisee is in full compliance with this  Agreement,  Franchisee may transfer this Agreement to a corporation  which conducts no business  other than the Pretzel  Time Unit and in which  Franchisee maintains management control and owns and controls one hundred percent (100%) of the equity  and  voting  power of all  issued  and  outstanding  capital  stock. Transfers of shares of such  corporation  will be subject to the  provisions  of Section 17.C.(2) and 17.C.(8).  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Franchisee  shall  remain  personally  liable  under  this  Agreement  as if the Transfer to such  corporation had not occurred.  The articles of  incorporation, by-laws and other organizational documents of such corporation shall recite that the issuance and  assignment of any interest  therein is restricted by the terms of Section 17 of this Franchise Agreement,  and all issued and outstanding stock certificates  of such  corporation  shall bear a legend reciting or referring to the restrictions hereof.

         17.E.  FORMATION OF A CORPORATION.





         In the event,  Franchisee  desires to form a  corporation  for the sole purpose of acting as a  Franchisee  under this  Agreement,  in  addition  to the conditions  imposed under Section 17, the following terms and conditions must be complied with, unless otherwise agreed in writing by Pretzel Time:

                  (1) Franchisee  must be the owner of the majority  interest in                   the  voting  stock  of  the   corporation  and  the  principal                   executive officer thereof;

                  (2)  Franchisee's  shareholders  shall enter into an agreement                   under seal with Pretzel Time, on Pretzel Time's standard form,                   guaranteeing  the  full  payment  of the  corporation's  money                   obligations to Pretzel Time as individual  surety and agreeing                   to be bound  individually  by the  non-competition  obligation                   stated herein; and

                  (3) Franchisee and all shareholders  must continue to meet its                   obligations  under  the  noncompetition   provisions  of  this                   Agreement.

         In  the  event   Franchisee  or  its  successor  is  a  corporation  or partnership or similar entity, it is agreed as follows:

                  (1) That the  Articles  of  Incorporation  and  By-Laws or the                   Partnership  Agreement,  shall  reflect  that the issuance and                   transfer of voting stock or other ownership  interest therein,                   is restricted by the terms of this Agreement. Franchisee shall                   furnish  Pretzel  Time at the  time of the  execution  of this                   Agreement or of assignment to the  corporation  or partners of                   Franchisee, a written agreement stating that no stockholder or                   partner  will  sell,  assign  or  transfer  voluntarily  or by                   operation  of law  any  securities  of  Franchisee,  or  other                   ownership  interest  in  Franchisee,  to any  person or entity                   other than existing shareholders or partnership, to the extent                   permitted  hereunder,  without  the prior  written  consent of                   Pretzel Time.  All securities  issued by Franchisee  will bear                   the  following  legend  which  shall be  printed  legibly  and                   conspicuously  on each stock  certificate or other evidence of                   Ownership Interest:

                    "The  transfer of these  securities  is subject to the terms                     and  conditions of a Franchise  Agreement with Pretzel Time,                     Inc.  dated , 199____.  Reference is made to said  Agreement                     and to  the  restrictive  provisions  of  the  Articles  and                     By-laws or Shareholders or Partnership Agreement."

                  (2) That if Franchisee or a successor,  is a corporation,  the                   majority of the capital stock thereof shall not at any time or                   in the  aggregate  be sold,  assigned,  pledged,  mortgaged or                   transferred without the prior written consent of Pretzel Time.

                  (3) Franchisee  represents and warrants that its Owners are as                   set  forth  on  Exhibit  B  attached  to  this  Agreement  and                   covenants that it will not vary from that ownership  structure                   without the prior written approval of Pretzel Time.

         17.F.  DEATH OR DISABILITY OF FRANCHISEE.

         Upon the death or Permanent  Disability of Franchisee or, if Franchisee is a  corporation  or  partnership,  the  Owner  of a  Controlling  Interest  in Franchisee, the executor, administrator, conservator, guardian or other personal representative  of such  person  shall  transfer  Franchisee's  interest in this Agreement or such interest in  Franchisee  to a third party  approved by Pretzel Time.  Such  disposition  of this  Agreement  or  such  interest  in  Franchisee (including,  without  limitation,  transfer by bequest or inheritance)  shall be completed  within a reasonable  time, not to exceed six (6) months from the date of death or  Permanent  Disability,  and shall be  subject  to all the terms and conditions  applicable to Transfers contained in Section 17.B. and 17.C. Failure to transfer the interest in this Agreement or such interest in Franchisee within said period of time shall constitute a breach of this Agreement.

         17.G.    PRETZEL TIME'S FIRST RIGHT OF REFUSAL.

          If  Franchisee  (or its Owners)  shall at any time  determine to sell, assign or transfer for consideration  this Agreement or an Ownership Interest in Franchisee  or the Unit,  Franchisee  (or its Owners)  shall obtain a bona fide, executed  written offer and earnest  money deposit from a responsible  and fully disclosed purchaser (including lists of the Owners of record and beneficially of any corporate  offeror and all general and limited  partners of any  partnership offeror and, in the case of a publicly-held  corporation or limited partnership, copies of the most current annual and quarterly  reports) and shall  immediately submit to Pretzel  Time a true and  complete  copy of such  offer,  which  shall include  details of the payment  terms of the proposed  sale and the sources and terms of any financing for the proposed purchase price. To be a valid, bona fide offer, the proposed purchase price shall be denominated in a dollar amount.  The offer must apply only to an interest in this  Agreement,  Franchisee or the Unit and may not  include  an offer to  purchase  any  other  property  or  rights of Franchisee (or its Owners).  However,  if the offeror  proposes to buy any other property  or  rights  from   Franchisee   (or  its  Owners)  under  a  separate, contemporaneous offer, the price and terms of purchase offered to Franchisee (or its Owners) for the  interest in this  Agreement,  Franchisee  or the Unit shall reflect the bona fide price  offered  therefore  and shall not reflect any value for any other property or rights.





          Pretzel  Time  shall  have the right,  exercisable  by written  notice delivered to Franchisee  (or its Owners) within sixty (60) days from the date of delivery  of an exact copy of such  offer to  Pretzel  Time,  to  purchase  such interest for the price and on the terms and conditions  contained in such offer, provided that Pretzel Time may substitute cash for any form of payment  proposed in such offer,  Pretzel Time's credit shall be deemed equal to the credit of any proposed  purchaser and Pretzel Time shall have not less than sixty (60) days to prepare  for  closing.  Without  regard to the  representations  and  warranties demanded by the proposed  purchaser,  if any,  Pretzel Time shall be entitled to purchase such interest subject to all customary  representations  and warranties given by the  Franchisee,  seller of the assets of a business or voting stock of an  incorporated  business,  as  applicable,   including,   without  limitation, representations  and  warranties as to ownership,  condition and title to stock, and /or assets,  liens and  encumbrances  relating to the stock  and/or  assets, validity  of  contracts  and  liabilities  of the  corporation  whose  stock  is purchased and affecting the assets, contingent or otherwise.

         If Pretzel Time exercises its right of first refusal,  Franchisee  (and its Owners)  agrees that,  for a period of twelve (12) months  commencing on the date of the closing,  neither  Franchisee (nor its Owners) shall have any direct or indirect interest  (through a member of the immediate  families of Franchisee or its Owners of  otherwise)  as a  disclosed  or  beneficial  owner,  investor, partner, director, officer, employee, consultant, representative, or agent or in any other capacity in any Competitive Business located or operating within three (3) miles of the Unit,  and/or  three (3) miles of any other  Pretzel Time Unit. The  restrictions  of this Section  shall not be  applicable to the ownership of shares  of a class of  securities  listed on a stock  exchange  or traded on the over-the-counter market that represent two percent (2%) or less of the number of shares of that class of  securities  issued  and  outstanding.  If Pretzel  Time exercises its right of first refusal, Franchisee (and its Owners) further agrees that he will abide by the restrictions of Section 17.C.(13).

          If  Pretzel  Time  does not  exercise  its  right  of  first  refusal, Franchisee or its Owners may complete the sale to such purchaser pursuant to and on the exact  terms of such  offer,  subject to Pretzel  Time's  approval of the Transfer as provided in Section 17,  provided that if the sale to such purchaser is not completed  within 120 days after  delivery of such offer to Pretzel Time, or if there is a  material  change  in the terms of the sale  (which  Franchisee shall  promptly  communicate  to Pretzel  Time),  Pretzel  Time's right to first refusal shall be extended for thirty (30) days after the  expiration of such 120 day period or after the material change in the terms of the sale so communicated to Pretzel Time.

A termination of this Agreement  by  Franchisee  for any reason other than a  substantial  breach of a material provision of this Agreement by Pretzel Time, and Pretzel Time's failure to cure  such  breach  as  provided  above  shall  be  deemed a  termination  by Franchisee without cause.

19.      DEFAULT AND TERMINATION.

         19.A.  EXACT AND COMPLETE PERFORMANCE REQUIRED.

         Franchisee  acknowledges that complete  performance of all the terms of this  Agreement  is  necessary  for  the  protection  of  Pretzel  Time  and its franchisees.  It is therefore agreed that complete and exact  performance by the Franchisee  of each of his  promises  contained  herein  is a  condition  to the continuance of this Franchise.

         19.B.    DEFAULT AND RIGHT TO CURE.

         If Franchisee  defaults in the  performance of any of the terms of this Agreement  or the  Operations  Manual,  Pretzel  Time,  in addition to all other remedies  available to it at law or in equity and without prejudice to any other rights or remedies,  may  immediately  terminate  this Agreement by delivering a written notice to Franchisee of any breach of this Agreement and a notice period of  forty-five  (45) days shall be given to  Franchisee,  unless such default is cured by the  Franchisee  within thirty (30) days after written  notice  thereof from Pretzel Time to Franchisee.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,  if the default is other  than a failure to pay a monetary  obligation  to Pretzel  Time or to a related  company and of a nature that more than thirty (30) days are  reasonably required to cure,  Franchisee  shall  commence  to cure the default  within said thirty (30) day period and shall proceed with such cure with due diligence  with a view to accomplishing the cure at the earliest possible moment, and within the period,  if any,  designated  by Pretzel Time as the allowable  additional  time within which the cure must be accomplished.

         19.C.  EXTENSION OF NOTICE.

         If any  applicable  law or rule  requires  a  greater  prior  notice of termination,  the prior notice required by such law or rule shall be substituted for the notice requirements herein.

         19.D.  REPEATED BREACHES.

         Further,   notwithstanding  anything  herein  elsewhere  contained,  if Franchisee shall repeatedly fail to comply with the terms of this Agreement,  or any of them,  of any nature,  even though such  failures may be cured within the applicable  grace  periods,  Pretzel Time shall have the right by written notice given to Franchisee  immediately  to declare this  Agreement  terminated,  which right shall be in addition to and without prejudice to any other right or remedy to which Pretzel Time may be entitled  under this  Agreement or otherwise  under applicable law. As used in this Agreement the term "repeatedly  fail" shall mean three (3) defaults within any twelve (12) month period, even if the defaults are later cured.          19.E.

                  (xx)  Franchisee  (or any of its Owners) fails on three (3) or                   more separate  occasions within any period of twenty-four (24)                   consecutive  months to comply with this  Agreement  whether or                   not such  failures  to comply are  corrected  after  notice of                   default  is  given,  or  failure  on two (2) or more  separate                   occasions within any period of twelve (12) consecutive  months                   to comply within the same  requirement  under this  Agreement,                   whether or not such  failures  to comply are  corrected  after                   notice of default is given.

20. RIGHTS AND  OBLIGATIONS OF PRETZEL TIME AND FRANCHISEE  UPON  TERMINATION OR EXPIRATION OF THE FRANCHISE.

         20.A.  AMOUNTS OWED.

         Unless otherwise authorized by Pretzel Time in writing, in the event of expiration or termination  of this  Agreement for any reason,  or upon the sale, transfer or  assignment  of the  Franchise by  Franchisee,  all of  Franchisee's rights  hereunder  shall  terminate  and  Franchisee  shall cease to operate the Franchise.  Franchisee agrees to pay Pretzel Time within fifteen (15) days after the effective date of termination or expiration of this Agreement, or such later date that the amounts due to Pretzel Time are  determined,  such  Royalty  Fees, Advertising  Fund Fees,  amounts owed for purchases by  Franchisee  from Pretzel Time or its  Affiliates,  interest  due on any of the  foregoing  and all  other amounts owed to Pretzel Time or its Affiliates which are then unpaid.

         Expiration or  termination  of this  Agreement for any reason shall not affect,  modify, or discharge any note, account receivable,  or debt, contingent or otherwise,  existing or arising under this Agreement, or any prior agreement, contract, or dealing between Pretzel Time and Franchisee.

         20.B.    DISCONTINUANCE OF MARKS.

         Franchisee  agrees to immediately  discontinue  all use of trade names, trademarks,  logotypes,  forms of advertising  and other  commercial  symbols of Pretzel Time, and forms of advertising indicative of Pretzel Time and cancel all assumed  name  registrations.  Franchisee  further  shall  remove or cause to be removed all signs and  structures  indicative  of a Pretzel  Time Unit and shall alter the premises occupied by Franchisee so as to distinguish the same from its former appearance and from a Pretzel Time franchise.  Further,  Franchisee shall discontinue  the use of any and all printed goods and materials using said trade names,  trademarks,  logos and other  commercial  symbols  of Pretzel  Time.  If Franchisee  refuses to comply  with the terms of this  Section 20 after  Pretzel Time  requests  compliance,  Pretzel  Time  shall  have the right to enter  upon Franchisee's  premises  without being deemed guilty of  trespassing or any other offense,  and make or cause to be made such  changes  at  Franchisee's  expense, which Franchisee agrees to pay upon demand.

         Franchisee  agrees to not directly or  indirectly at any time or in any manner (except with respect to other Pretzel Time Units owned by the Franchisee) identify himself or any business as a current or former Pretzel Time Unit, or as a franchisee,  licensee or dealer of Pretzel Time or its Affiliates.  Franchisee further  agrees to not use any Mark,  any colorable  imitation  thereof or other indicia of a Pretzel  Time Unit in any manner or for any  purpose or utilize for any purpose any trade name,  trade or service  mark or other  commercial  symbol that suggests or indicates a connection or association  with Pretzel Time or its Affiliates.  Franchisee (or any of its Owners) agrees after  termination he will not do  business  under any name or in any  manner  that  might tend to give the general  public the  impression  that he is  associated,  affiliated,  licensed, franchised by or related to Pretzel Time.  The Franchisee (or any of its Owners) may not thereafter  use any name,  logo type, or symbol  confusingly  similar to





Pretzel  Time's  Service  Mark,  logo type or symbol.  If  Franchisee  continues operating a business at the franchised  location it will exert every  reasonable effort to inform the public of his new status,  including a change of  telephone number and advertising materials.

         The Franchise granted to Franchisee  hereunder to sell Products bearing Pretzel Time's Marks does not include the right to sell or advertise for sale of Franchisee's  Franchise itself or of its business location.  No advertisement by Franchisee  or  other  public  solicitation  for  sale of his  interest  in this Agreement  may  include a  representation  of Pretzel  Time's  trademark  or any reference to Pretzel Time or its trademark system.

         20.C.    RETURN OF MATERIALS.

         Franchisee  agrees to return to  Pretzel  Time all  signs,  sign-faces, forms,  invoices,  letterhead,  and  other  materials  containing  any  Mark  or otherwise identifying or relating to a Pretzel Time Unit and allow Pretzel Time, without liability to remove all such items from the Unit. Franchisee also agrees to return all  materials  and  confidential  information  loaned to  Franchisee, including,  without limitation,  all Operations Manuals and Training Manuals and videos. Franchisee agrees to return all materials and supplies identified by the Marks in full cases or  packages  to Pretzel  Time for credit and dispose of all other materials and supplies, but not equipment,  identified by the Marks within thirty (30) days after the effective  date of  termination or expiration of this Agreement.

         20.D.    TELEPHONE COMPANY.

         Franchisee  agrees to notify the  telephone  company and all  telephone directory  publishers of the termination or expiration of Franchisee's  right to use any  telephone  and telecopy  numbers and any regular,  classified  or other telephone  directory  listings  associated  with any Mark and to  authorize  the transfer  thereof to Pretzel Time or at its direction.  Franchisee  acknowledges and agrees  that as between  him and  Pretzel  Time,  Pretzel  Time has the sole rights to and  interest in all  telephone  and  telecopy  numbers and  directory listings  associated  with any Mark.  Franchisee  authorizes  Pretzel Time,  and hereby appoints Pretzel Time and any of its officers as Franchisee's attorney in fact, to direct the telephone company and all telephone directory  publishers to transfer any telephone and telecopy numbers and directory  listings  relating to the Pretzel Time Units to Pretzel Time or at its  direction,  should  Franchisee fail or refuse to do so, and the telephone  company and all telephone  directory publishers  may accept such direction or this agreement as conclusive of Pretzel Time's  exclusive  rights in such  telephone and telecopy  numbers and directory listings  and Pretzel  Time's  authority to direct  their  transfer.  Franchisee agrees to execute a  collateral  assignment  of  telephone  numbers and listings agreement  which is attached hereto as Exhibit G. In no event shall Pretzel Time be responsible  for any charges  incurred by Franchisee and associated  with the telephone company prior to the date of transfer.

         20.E.    CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.

         Franchisee (and its Owners) agrees that upon  termination or expiration of this Agreement, he will immediately cease to use any Confidential Information of Pretzel Time or its Affiliates disclosed to him pursuant to this Agreement in any business or otherwise.  This  provision is also  applicable to the Owners if the Franchise is a corporation or partnership.

         20.F.    LEASING.

         If Franchisee  has leased the  premises,  Pretzel Time may, in its sole discretion  and without any  obligation to do so,  assume the lease.  Franchisee will not be entitled to any refund of the initial franchise fee,  royalties,  or Advertising Fund Fees.

         20.G.    COVENANT NOT TO COMPETE.

         Upon  termination of this  Agreement,  in accordance with its terms and conditions or by Franchisee  without cause, or upon expiration of this Agreement (unless the Franchise is renewed as provided for in this Agreement),  Franchisee and its Owners agree that for a period of TWELVE (12) months  commencing  on the effective  date of  termination  or expiration  or the date on which  Franchisee complies  with this Section,  whichever is later,  neither  Franchisee,  nor its Owners,  nor any person or entity  affiliated  with  Franchisee or  Franchisee's shareholders or partners shall have any direct or indirect  interest  (through a member of the immediate  families of Franchisee or its Owners or otherwise) as a disclosed or beneficial owner, investor,  partner, director,  officer, employee, consultant,  representative,  agent or in any other capacity in any  Competitive Business  located or operating:  (1) at the Site;  (2) within three (3) miles of the Unit;  and/or (3) within  three (3) miles of any other  Pretzel Time Unit in operation  or  under  development  on  the  effective  date  of  termination  or expiration of this  agreement for a period of one year after the  termination or expiration.  The  restrictions  of this Section  shall not be  applicable to the ownership  of shares of a class of  securities  listed  on a stock  exchange  or traded on the over-the-counter market that represent two percent (2%) or less of the  number  of shares  of that  class of  securities  issued  and  outstanding. Franchisee  and its Owners  expressly  acknowledge  that they possess skills and abilities of a general nature and have other  opportunities  for exploiting such skills. Consequently, enforcement of the covenants made in this Section will not deprive the Franchisee or its Owners or shareholders of their personal  goodwill or ability to earn a living.

The Franchise  Agreement contains a covenant not to compete which extends beyond





the termination of the franchise. Franchisee and its Owners acknowledge that the covenant  not to compete is fair and  reasonable,  and will not impose any undue hardship,  since the Franchisee (and its Owners) has other considerable  skills, experience and education  which will afford him the opportunity to derive income from other endeavors.

Neither  Franchisee  nor any of its Owners shall divert or attempt to divert any business or any customers of any Pretzel Time Unit to any  Competitive  Business or employ or seek to employ any  person who is  employed  by Pretzel  Time,  its Affiliates  or a franchisee  of Pretzel Time nor induce or attempt to induce any such person to leave said  employment  without the prior written consent of such person's employer.

         20.H.  PRETZEL TIME'S RIGHT TO PURCHASE ASSETS OF THE UNIT.

         Upon  termination of this Agreement by Pretzel Time in accordance  with its terms and  conditions or by Franchisee  without cause or upon  expiration of this  Agreement  (unless the franchise  has been  renewed),  Pretzel  Time,  its Affiliates  or  its  assignee  shall  have  the  option  (not  the  obligation), exercisable  by giving  written  notice  thereof within sixty (60) days from the date of such  expiration  or  termination,  to acquire from  Franchisee  all the assets  in the Unit  including  the  equipment,  furnishings,  signs,  leasehold improvements,  usable  inventory  of  Products,  materials,  supplies  and other tangible assets of the Unit and an assignment of the lease for the Unit. Pretzel Time  shall  have the  unrestricted  right to assign  this  option to  purchase. Pretzel Time or its assignee  shall be entitled to all customary  warranties and representations  in  connection  with its  asset  purchase,  including,  without limitation,  representations  and  warranties as to ownership,  condition of and title to assets, no liens and encumbrances on the assets,  validity of contracts and agreements and liabilities  inuring to Pretzel Time or affecting the assets, contingent or otherwise.

         (1) The purchase price for the assets of the Unit shall be equal to the greater of:

                  The sum of the book  value  of the  Unit's  assets  (including                   furnishings,  fixtures, equipment, and leasehold improvements)                   amortized on a straight-line basis over a five (5) year period                   plus the lesser of costs and the then-current wholesale market                   value of all  usable  inventory  of  Products,  materials  and                   supplies (i.e. in good and saleable condition and not obsolete                   or discontinued), or

                  The  product of the Unit's  average  cash flow for the two (2)                   most recently  completed  fiscal years  multiplied by two (2).                   "Cash  flow"  represents  the  Unit's  net  revenues  less all                   pretzel  unit-related  costs (i.e., cost of goods sold, labor,                   occupancy   and  other  Unit   expenses)  as  well  as  annual                   administrative  costs of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) and                   royalty and  service  fees,  but not  including  interest  and                   depreciation.

         (2)  Pretzel  Time and its  Affiliates  shall have the right to set off against and reduce the purchase  price by any and all amounts owed by Franchisee to Pretzel  Time and its  Affiliates.  Pretzel  Time may exclude from the assets purchased  hereunder any  equipment,  furnishings,  signs,  usable  inventory of Products,  materials  or supplies of the Unit that Pretzel Time has not approved as meeting its standards for Pretzel Time Unit,  and the purchase price shall be reduced by the  replacement  costs of such excluded  items which are required in the operation of the Unit.

         (3) The  purchase  price  shall be paid in cash at the  closing  of the purchase, which shall take place no later than ninety (90) days after receipt by Franchisee  of Pretzel  Time's notice of exercise of this option to purchase the Unit, at which time Franchisee shall deliver instruments transferring to Pretzel Time or its assignee good and merchantable  title to the assets purchased,  free and clear of all liens and encumbrances  with all sales and other transfer taxes paid by  Franchisee,  and all  licenses  or  permits  of the Unit  which  may be assigned or transferred. In the event the closing of the purchase does not occur within said ninety (90) day period because Franchisee fails to act diligently in connection therewith,  the purchase price shall be reduced by ten percent (10%). Franchisee  further agrees that the purchase  price shall be further  reduced by ten percent (10%) per month for each subsequent  month  Franchisee  fails to act diligently to consummate this  transaction.  In the event that Franchisee cannot deliver clear title to all of the purchased assets as aforesaid, or in the event there are other unresolved  issues, at Pretzel Time's option,  the losing of the sale shall be accomplished through an escrow.  Prior to closing,  Franchisee and Pretzel  Time shall  comply with the  applicable  Bulk Sales  provisions  of the Uniform Commercial Code as enacted in the state in which the Unit is located.

         (4) If Pretzel Time or its assignee  exercises this option to purchase, pending  the  closing of such  purchase,  Pretzel  Time may appoint a manager to maintain the operation of the Unit, at its option,  require  Franchisee to close the Unit during such time period  without  removing any assets.  If Pretzel Time appoints a manager to maintain the operation of the Unit pending closing of such purchase, all funds from the Unit's operation during the period of management by a  Pretzel  Time  appointed  manager  shall be kept in a  separate  fund and all expenses of the Unit, including compensation,  other costs and travel and living expenses of the Pretzel Time appointed  manager,  shall be charged to such fund. As compensation for the management services provided,  Pretzel Time shall charge such fund ten  percent  (10%) of the  Unit's net  revenues  during the period of Pretzel Time's management. Operation of the Unit during any such period shall be for and on behalf of  Franchisee,  provided  that Pretzel Time shall have a duty only to utilize its good faith  efforts and shall not be liable to Franchisee or





its Owners for any debts,  losses or obligations  incurred by the Unit or to any creditor  of  Franchisee  for any  merchandise  materials,  supplies  or service purchased by the Unit during any period in which it is managed by Pretzel Time's appointed  manager.  Franchisee  shall maintain in force all insurance  policies required for the Unit until the date of closing.

21.      RELATIONSHIP OF THE PARTIES/INDEMNIFICATION.

         21.A.    EXCLUSIVE RELATIONSHIP.

         Franchisee acknowledges and agrees that Pretzel Time would be unable to protect  Confidential  Information  against  unauthorized  use or disclosure and would be unable to  encourage  a free  exchange of ideas and  information  among Pretzel Time Units if  Franchisees  of Pretzel Time Units were permitted to hold interests in or perform services for a Competitive  Business except as specified in Exhibit C.  Franchisee  also  acknowledges  that Pretzel Time has granted the Franchise to  Franchisee  in  consideration  of and reliance  upon  Franchisee's agreement to deal  exclusively  with Pretzel Time.  Franchisee  therefore agrees that  during the term of the  Franchise  Agreement,  or the period of time which Franchisee operates a Unit under this Agreement,  whichever is shorter,  neither Franchisee  nor  any  Affiliate,  immediate  family  member,  or  in  the  event Franchisee is a corporation

any Owner thereof and member of his immediate  family or in the event  Franchise is a partnership any partner  (general or limited) thereof and any member of his immediate family, shall:

         (1) Have  any  direct  or  indirect  interest  as an  owner,  investor,          partner, director, officer, employee, consultant, representative, agent          or in  any  other  capacity  in any  Competitive  Business  located  or          operating  at the Site or within  three (3) miles of any  Pretzel  Time          Unit  in  operation  or  under  development  on the  effective  date of          termination or expiration of this Agreement, except a Pretzel Time Unit          operated by Franchisee under Franchise Agreements with Pretzel Time; or

         (2) Recruit or hire any employee who, within the immediately  preceding          six (6) month period,  was employed by Pretzel Time or any Pretzel Time          Unit operated by Pretzel Time, its Affiliates or another  franchisee or          licensee  of  Pretzel  Time,   without   obtaining  the  prior  written          permission of Pretzel Time or such franchisee.

         Notwithstanding the foregoing,  Franchisee shall not be prohibited from owning securities  listed on a stock exchange or traded on the  over-the-counter market that represents two percent (2%) or less of that class of securities.

         Covenants contained in this Section shall be construed as severable and independent,   and  shall  be  interpreted  and  applied   consistent  with  the requirements  of  reasonableness.  Any judicial  reformation of these  covenants consistent  with this  interpretation  shall be enforceable as though  contained herein  and shall not affect any other  provisions  or terms of this  Agreement. This non-compete provision may not be enforceable under the laws of your state.

         21.B.  NO LIABILITY FOR ACTS OF OTHER PARTY.

         Franchisee shall not employ any of the Marks in signing any contract or applying  for any  franchise or permit or in a manner that may result in Pretzel Time's  liability for any of Franchisee's  indebtedness or obligations,  nor may Franchisee  use the Marks in any way not  expressly  authorized by Pretzel Time. Except as expressly  authorized in writing,  neither Pretzel Time nor Franchisee shall  make  any  express  or  implied  agreements,  warranties,  guarantees  or representations  or  incur  any  debt in the  name or on  behalf  of the  other, represent that their relationship is other than Pretzel Time and franchisee,  or be obligated by or have any liability  under any  agreements or  representations made by the other that are not  expressly  authorized  in writing.  Pretzel Time shall not be  obligated  for any damages to any person or  property  directly or indirectly  arising out of the  operation of the Unit or  Franchisee's  business authorized by or conducted pursuant to this Agreement.

         21.C.    TAXES.

         Pretzel  Time shall have no  liability  for any  sales,  use,  service, occupation,  excise,  gross receipts,  income,  property or other taxes, whether levied upon Franchisee, the Unit, Franchisee's property or upon Pretzel Time, in connection with the sales made or business  conducted by Franchisee.  Payment of all such taxes shall be Franchisee's responsibility.

         21.D.    INDEMNIFICATION.

         Franchisee   agrees  to  indemnify   and  hold  Pretzel  Time  and  its subsidiaries,  Affiliates, stockholders,  directors, officers, employees, agents and assignees harmless against, and to reimburse them for, any loss,  liability, judgment  or damages  (actual or  consequential)  and all  reasonable  costs and expenses of  defending  any claim  brought  against any of them or any action in which any of them is named as a party (including, without limitation, reasonable accountants,  attorneys' and expert witness fees, costs of investigation,  court costs, other litigation expenses,  damages to Pretzel Time's reputation and good will, travel expenses) which any of them may suffer,  sustain or incur by reason of, arising from or in connection  with  Franchisee's  ownership or operation of the Unit, unless such loss, liability or damage is only due to the negligence of Pretzel  Time  (or  its  Affiliates,  subsidiaries).  Pretzel  Time's  right  to indemnity  under  this  agreement  shall  arise  notwithstanding  that  joint or concurrent  liability  may be  imposed on Pretzel  Time by  statute,  ordinance, regulation or other law.  Franchisee  acknowledges and agrees that any action or inaction by any third party which is not an  Affiliate of Pretzel Time shall not





be attributable to or constitute negligence of Pretzel Time. The indemnities and assumptions of liabilities and  obligations  herein shall continue in full force and effect  subsequent to and  notwithstanding  the expiration or termination of this Agreement.

         Pretzel Time shall notify Franchisee of any claims and Franchisee shall be given the  opportunity  to assume the  defense of the matter.  If  Franchisee fails to assume the defense  within  three (3) days of notice  thereof,  Pretzel Time may defend the action in the manner reasonably appropriate,  and Franchisee shall pay to Pretzel Time all reasonable  costs,  including  without  limitation attorney's  fees,  court  costs,  expert  witness  fees,  travel  and  telephone expenses, incurred by Pretzel Time in effecting such defense, in addition to any such sum which Pretzel Time may pay by reason of any settlement agreed to by the parties or reasonably  negotiated by Pretzel Time in the event  Franchisee fails to assume the defense, or judgment against Pretzel Time.

         21.E.  INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR.

         It is understood and agreed by the parties hereto that Franchisee is an independent contractor and is not an agent, partner, joint venturer, or employee of  Pretzel  Time.  Pretzel  Time and  Franchisee  agree  that  nothing  in this Agreement  is  intended  to  create  a  fiduciary   relationship  between  them. Franchisee  shall have no right to bind or obligate  Pretzel Time in any way nor shall he  represent  that he has any right to do so.  Pretzel Time shall have no control over the terms and conditions of employment of Franchisee's employees.

         In all public records and in his  relationship  with other persons,  on stationery, business forms and checks, Franchisee shall indicate his independent ownership of the  franchised  Unit and that he is a franchisee  of Pretzel Time. Franchisee  shall exhibit on the premises in such places as may be designated by Pretzel  Time,  a Pretzel  Time  approved  notice  that the  franchised  Unit is operated by an  independent  operator and not by Pretzel Time or Pretzel  Time's Affiliates,  which operate company owned  franchises.  Franchisee shall take all legal  steps  such as a  fictitious  name  registration  to ensure  Franchisee's independent business status.

22.      PROTECTION OF TRADE SECRETS.

         22.A.  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.

         Pretzel Time  possesses  and will further  develop and acquire  certain confidential  and  proprietary  information  and trade  secrets  relating to the operation  of  Pretzel  Time  Units,  which  includes,  but not  limited  to the following  categories  of  information,  methods,  techniques,  procedures,  and knowledge  developed or to be  developed by Pretzel  Time,  its  consultants  or contractors,  its Affiliates or its designees, and/or franchisees ("Confidential Information"):

         (1)  methods,   techniques,   equipment,   specifications,   standards,          policies, procedures, information, concepts and systems relating to and          knowledge  of  and  experience  in  the   development,   operation  and          franchising of Pretzel Time Units:

         (2) site selection criteria;

         (3) marketing and promotional programs for Pretzel Time Units;

         (4) recipes, ingredients,  formulas, mixes, spices, seasonings, sauces,          recipes for, and methods for the preparation,  cooking,  and serving of          the Products;

         (5)  techniques,  formats,  specifications,  systems,  procedures,  and          knowledge of and experience in the development and operation of Pretzel          Time Units;

         (6) knowledge of specifications  for and suppliers of certain Products,          materials, supplies, equipment, furnishings and fixtures;

         (7) sales data and information  concerning  inventory  requirements for          Products,  materials and supplies, and specifications for and knowledge          of suppliers of certain materials,  equipment, and fixtures for Pretzel          Time Units;

         (8) employee selection procedures, training and staffing levels;

         (9) Operations Manual and other Manuals prepared by Pretzel Time; and

         (10) information concerning Product sales, operating results, financial          performance and other financial data of Pretzel Time Units.

         Pretzel Time will disclose such parts of the  Confidential  Information as  Pretzel  Time deems  necessary  or  advisable  from time to time in its sole discretion  for the  operation  of a  Pretzel  Time  Unit to  Franchisee  during training, and in guidance and assistance furnished to Franchisee during the term of the Franchise, and Franchisee may learn or otherwise obtain from Pretzel Time additional  Confidential  Information  of  Pretzel  Time  during the term of the Franchise.  Franchisee acknowledges that the foregoing Confidential  Information is highly  confidential.  Franchisee  acknowledges  and agrees  that he will not acquire  any  interest  in  Confidential  Information,  other  than the right to utilize Confidential Information disclosed to Franchisee in the operation of the Pretzel  Time  Unit  during  the  term of this  Agreement,  and  that the use or duplication  of  any  Confidential  Information  in  any  other  business  would constitute an unfair method of competition. Franchisee, including its directors,





officers,  shareholders,  and partners agree(s) that Confidential Information is proprietary,  includes  trade  secrets  of  Pretzel  Time  and is  disclosed  to Franchisee solely on the condition that Franchisee  agrees,  and Franchisee (and its Owners) does hereby agree, that he:

         (1) shall not disclose any  information  pertaining to the Pretzel Time          System,  directly or indirectly,  to any person,  natural or corporate,          without the express prior written  consent of Pretzel Time.  Franchisee          may disclose to its Unit Manager such  information  deemed necessary to          disclose,  provided  such Unit  Manager  has  agreed to  maintain  such          information in confidence in Pretzel Time's  confidentiality  agreement          and Pretzel Time has received such executed agreement  (attached hereto          as Exhibit H);

         (2) Will not use  Confidential  Information  in any other  business  or capacity;

         (3)  Will  maintain  the  absolute   confidentiality   of  Confidential          Information during and after the term of this Agreement;

         (4) Will not make  unauthorized  copies of any portion of  Confidential          Information disclosed in written or other tangible form; and

         (5) Will adopt and implement  all  reasonable  procedures  that Pretzel          Time  prescribes  from  time  to time to  prevent  unauthorized  use or          disclosure of Confidential Information,  including, without limitation,          restrictions on disclosure thereof to his employees.

         This  confidentiality  requirement  shall  not apply in a  judicial  or administrative  proceeding  to the extent  Franchisee  is legally  compelled  to disclose such information,  provided Franchisee shall have used his best efforts and shall have afforded  Pretzel Time the  opportunity  to obtain an appropriate protective order or other assurance satisfactory to Pretzel Time of confidential treatment for the information required to be so disclosed.  This restrictions on Franchisee's  disclosure and use of the Confidential  Information shall also not apply to the  disclosure of  information,  methods,  procedures,  techniques and knowledge which are or become  generally  known in the food service  business in the Territory, other than through disclosure (whether deliberate or inadvertent) by Franchisee.

         Notwithstanding   the  foregoing  and  any  other   provision  of  this Agreement,  Franchisee may use the  Confidential  Information in connection with the operation of other Pretzel Time Units (in addition to the Unit)  pursuant to other Franchise Agreements with Pretzel Time.

         22.B.  DISCLOSURE OF IDEAS AND NEW PROCEDURES.

         Franchisee  shall  fully and  promptly  disclose to Pretzel  Time,  all ideas,  concepts,  methods  and  techniques  relating  to  the  development  and operation  of a dessert or snack food  business  conceived  or  developed by the Franchisee  and/or  Franchisee's  employees  during the term of this  Agreement. Franchisee  agrees and grants to Pretzel Time and its Affiliates a perpetual and worldwide  right to use and  authorize  other  Pretzel  Time Units or other food service businesses  operated by Pretzel Time or its Affiliates,  franchisees and designees  to  use  such  ideas,  recipes,  formulas,   concepts,  methods,  and techniques  relating to the development  and/or  operation of a dessert or snack food business.  If incorporated into the Pretzel Time System for the development and/or operation of Pretzel Time Units, such ideas, recipes, formulas, concepts, methods and techniques  shall become the sole and exclusive  property of Pretzel Time without any further consideration to Franchisee. Pretzel Time shall have no obligation to make any lump sum or on-going  payments to Franchisee with respect to any such idea, concept, method, technique or product.  Franchisee agrees that Franchisee  will not use nor will it allow any other person or entity to use any such concept,  method,  technique or product  without  obtaining  Pretzel Time's prior written approval.

23.      ENFORCEMENT.

         23.A.    UNAVOIDABLE DELAYS.

         Delays in the  performance  of any duties  hereunder  which are not the fault of, and not within the reasonable  preventive control of, the party due to perform,  including but not limited to, fire,  flood,  labor  disputes,  natural disasters, acts of God, civil disorders, riots,  insurrections,  work stoppages, slowdowns or disputes,  or other  similar  events,  shall not cause a default in said  performance,  but the parties shall extend the time of  performance  for a period of time equivalent to the length of delay,  or for such other  reasonable period of time as agreed by the parties.

         23.B.    RIGHTS OF PARTIES ARE CUMULATIVE.

         The rights of Pretzel Time and Franchisee  hereunder are cumulative and no exercise or  enforcement by Pretzel Time or Franchisee of any right or remedy hereunder  shall  preclude  the  exercise  or  enforcement  by  Pretzel  Time or Franchisee  of any  other  right  or  remedy  herein  or which  Pretzel  Time or Franchisee is entitled by law to enforce.

         23.C.    WAIVER OF OBLIGATIONS.

         Pretzel Time may by written instrument unilaterally waive or reduce any obligation  of  or  restriction  upon  Franchisee  under  this  Agreement,   and Franchisee may by written instrument unilaterally waive or reduce any obligation of or  restriction  upon  Pretzel  Time under  this  Agreement,  effective  upon delivery of written  notice  thereof to the other or such other  effective  date stated on the notice of waiver.  Whenever this Agreement requires Pretzel Time's





prior  approval  or  consent,  Franchisee  shall make a timely  written  request therefore, and such approval shall be obtained in writing. Pretzel Time makes no warranties  or  guaranties  upon  which  Franchisee  may rely,  and  assumes  no liability or  obligation  to  Franchisee,  by granting  any waiver,  approval or consent to  Franchisee,  or by reason of any  neglect,  delay,  or denial of any request therefore. Any waiver granted by Pretzel Time shall be without prejudice to any other rights Pretzel Time may have, will be subject

to continuing review by Pretzel Time, and may be revoked, in Pretzel Time's sole discretion,  at any  time  and  for  any  reason,  effective  upon  delivery  to Franchisee of ten (10) days' prior written notice.

         23.D.    CONTINUING OBLIGATIONS.

          All  obligations of Pretzel Time and Franchisee  which expressly or by their very nature survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement  shall continue  in  full  force  and  effect  subsequent  to and  notwithstanding  its expiration  or  termination  and until  they are  satisfied  or by their  nature expire.

         23.E.    INVALID OR UNENFORCEABLE PROVISIONS.

         If any provisions of this  Agreement,  or its application to any person or  circumstance,  is deemed  invalid or  unenforceable  by a court of competent jurisdiction,  then the remainder of this  Agreement or the  application of such provision  to other  persons or  circumstances  shall not be  affected  thereby, provided,  however,  that if any provision or application  thereof is invalid or unenforceable,  the court shall  substitute a suitable and  equitable  provision therefore  in order to carry out,  so far as may be valid and  enforceable,  the intent and purpose of the invalid or unenforceable provision.

         If any applicable and binding law or rule of any jurisdiction  requires a  greater  prior  notice  of the  termination  of or  refusal  to enter  into a successor Franchise  Agreement to this Agreement than is required hereunder,  or the  taking of some  other  action  not  required  hereunder,  or if,  under any applicable  and binding law or rule of any  jurisdiction,  any provision of this Agreement  or any  standard or procedure  outlined in the  Operations  Manual is invalid or unenforceable,  the prior notice and/or other action required by such law or rule shall be  substituted  for the  comparable  provisions  hereof,  and Pretzel  Time shall  have the  right,  in its sole  discretion,  to modify  such invalid or unenforceable operations procedure or standard to the extent required to be valid and enforceable.

         23.F.  INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.

         Franchisee  recognizes and  acknowledges the unique value and secondary meaning  attached to the Pretzel Time system,  its  trademarks,  service  marks, standards of operation and Pretzel Time's property.  Franchisee acknowledges and agrees that any noncompliance with the restrictive  covenants  contained herein, including  without  limitation  those provisions  pertaining to  noncompetition, confidentiality  and the improper or  unauthorized  use of Pretzel  Time's Marks will cause  irreparable  damage to Pretzel Time and its franchisees.  Franchisee therefore agrees that should it violate any restrictive covenant, or threaten to breach the  restrictive  covenants,  then Pretzel Time shall be entitled to both permanent  and temporary  injunctive  relief,  without  bond,  from any court of competent  jurisdiction  in addition to any other remedies to which Pretzel Time may be entitled,  at law or in equity,  under this agreement or otherwise  under applicable law.

         23.G.    APPLICABLE LAW.

         Except to the extent governed by the U.S. Trademark Act of 1946 (Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C.  "1051 et seq.),  this Agreement,  the other agreements  referred herein,  and the offer and the sale of the  franchise  shall be  governed in all respects  and  aspects  by the  laws of the  Commonwealth  of  Pennsylvania  and expressly  excluding  the laws  pertaining  to the choice of law and conflict of laws.

         23.H.    ENTIRE STATUS OF AGREEMENT.

         This Agreement  contains the entire  agreement of the parties and there are no other oral or written  understandings or agreements  between Pretzel Time and Franchisee  relating to the subject matter of this agreement,  except as set forth in Pretzel  Time's  Offering  Circular  required by Rule under the Federal Trade  Commission  Act, a copy of which has been provided to  Franchisee  and of which   Franchisee   acknowledges   receipt,   there  are  no   representations, inducements, promises, agreements arrangements or undertakings, oral or written, between  the  parties  hereto  other than those set forth and duly  executed  in writing.  No agreement of any kind shall be binding upon either party unless and until the same has been made in writing and duly executed by both parties.

         Upon  acceptance  of this  Agreement  by  Pretzel  Time,  all  previous agreements,  contracts,  arrangements  or  understandings  of any kind,  oral or written,  relative to the franchise granted herein are cancelled, and all claims and demands  thereon are fully  satisfied.  This  agreement,  although  drawn by Pretzel Time,  shall be construed  fairly and reasonable,  and not more strictly against one party than against the other party hereto.

         23.I.    AMENDMENT OF AGREEMENT.

         This  Agreement  shall not be  modified  or  amended  except by written





agreement  executed by both parties hereto.  No oral amendment or waiver will be effective and that this provision cannot be orally amended or waived.  No waiver of default or rights will be effective unless in writing.

         23.J.    HEIRS, SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.

         Subject to the provisions  hereof  relating to transfer and assignment, this Agreement is intended to and does bind the heirs, executors, administrators and successors of any or all of the parties hereto.

         23.K.    CONDITIONS AND CONTINGENCIES.

         The obligations of the parties hereunder are expressly  conditional and contingent  upon the full execution of and performance of all obligations by the parties  under this  Agreement.  This  Agreement is expressly  conditional  upon Franchisee  executing all documents  required by this Agreement  within ten (10) days of receipt of the document.  Failure by Franchisee to execute any documents shall result in the Agreement being null and void.

         In addition during Franchisee's  training,  all documents pertaining to the  franchising of Franchisee as a Pretzel Time Unit shall be held in escrow by Pretzel Time. Title in and to the Pretzel Time Unit shall not pass to Franchisee until  Franchisee  has  been  trained  as  a  Pretzel  Time  franchisee  to  the satisfaction  of Pretzel Time. If Franchisee  fails to  satisfactorily  complete Pretzel Time initial  training,  the appointment of Franchisee as a Pretzel Time franchisee  and the granting of the franchise  business to  Franchisee  shall be null and void, all documents executed between Franchisee and Pretzel Time or its designees with respect to the transaction shall be terminated and cancelled. The Franchisee acknowledges and agrees that no portion of the Franchise fee shall be refunded if Franchisee  fails to complete  Pretzel Time's initial training class to the  satisfaction  of Pretzel Time. If the  Franchisee  completes the initial training to the  satisfaction  of Pretzel  Time,  Pretzel  Time will  provide to Franchisee fully signed copies of the Franchise Agreement.

         It is  understood  and agreed by the parties  that the  granting of the franchise  and all  contracts  and  agreements  entered  into by and between the parties with respect to the Unit are specifically contingent upon the signing of a lease for the Site.  In the event that a lease for the Site cannot be obtained on or before sixty (60) days after  delivery of Pretzel  Time's  approval of the Site at no fault  or delay by  Franchisee,  then all  contracts  and  agreements entered into by Pretzel Time, and  Franchisee  shall become null and void and of no effect,  and all monies  deposited by Franchisee less a nonrefundable  fee of $2,500 shall be refunded.

         23.L.    WAIVER BY PRETZEL TIME.

         No waiver by  Pretzel  Time of any  default  or  failure  to perform by Franchisee,  or of any  breach of the  terms of this  Agreement  or no  failure, refusal or neglect of Pretzel Time to exercise any right,  option or power given it under this Agreement,  shall preclude Pretzel Time from thereafter  requiring strict  compliance or from declaring  this  Agreement and the franchise  granted herein  revoke or  terminated.  The failure of Pretzel  Time to  terminate  this Agreement upon the occurrence of one or more Acts of Default will not constitute a waiver  or  otherwise  affect  the right of  Pretzel  Time to  terminate  this Franchise  because of a continuing or subsequent  failure to cure one or more of the aforesaid events of default or any other default.

         23.M.    COSTS AND EXPENSES OF ENFORCEMENT.

         If a claim  for  amounts  owed by  Franchisee  to  Pretzel  Time or its Affiliates  is  asserted  in any  judicial or  arbitration  proceeding  or later appeal,  or if Pretzel Time is required to enforce the Franchise  Agreement in a judicial or arbitration proceeding or later appeal, the prevailing party will be entitled  to  reimbursement  of its costs  and  expenses,  including  reasonable arbitrators',  accountants'  and  legal  fees,  whether  incurred  prior  to, in preparation for or in contemplation of the filing of any written demand,  claim, action,  hearing or  proceeding  to enforce  the  obligations  of the  Franchise Agreement.  If Pretzel Time incurs  expenses in connection  with your failure to pay when due amounts  owing to Pretzel  Time,  to submit  when due any  reports, information  or  supporting  records or otherwise  to comply with the  Franchise Agreement,  including,  but not limited to legal,  arbitrators'  and  accounting fees, you are required to reimburse Pretzel Time for any such costs and expenses which it incurs.          23.N.    RIGHTS OF PARTIES ARE CUMULATIVE

         THE  RIGHTS  OF  FRANCHISEE  AND  PRETZEL  TIME ARE  CUMULATIVE  AND NO EXERCISE OR  ENFORCEMENT  BY PRETZEL TIME OR  FRANCHISEE  OF ANY RIGHT OR REMEDY HEREUNDER  SHALL  PRECLUDE  THE  EXERCISE  OR  ENFORCEMENT  BY  PRETZEL  TIME OR FRANCHISEE OF ANY OTHER RIGHT OR REMEDY TO WHICH THE PARTY IS ENTITLED.

         23.O.    WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.

         EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO  FRANCHISEE'S  OBLIGATION  TO INDEMNIFY  PRETZEL TIME, THE PARTIES WAIVE TO THE FULLEST  EXTENT  PERMITTED BY LAW ANY RIGHT TO OR CLAIM FOR ANY PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES AGAINST THE OTHER AND AGREE THAT, IN THE EVENT OF A DISPUTE  BETWEEN THEM,  THE PARTY MAKING A CLAIM SHALL BE LIMITED TO RECOVERY OF ANY ACTUAL DAMAGES IT SUSTAINS.

         FRANCHISEE  IRREVOCABLY  SUBMITS TO THE  JURISDICTION OF SAID COURT AND WAIVES ANY OBJECTION  FRANCHISEE MAY HAVE TO EITHER THE JURISDICTION OR VENUE OF SUCH COURT.

         23.R.    LIMITATIONS OF CLAIMS

         EXCEPT FOR CLAIMS  BROUGHT BY PRETZEL TIME WITH REGARD TO  FRANCHISEE'S OBLIGATIONS  TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO PRETZEL TIME  PURSUANT TO THIS  AGREEMENT OR TO INDEMNIFY  PRETZEL TIME PURSUANT TO THIS  AGREEMENT,  ANY AND ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS  AGREEMENT  OR THE  RELATIONSHIP  OF  FRANCHISEE  AND PRETZEL  TIME  PURSUANT TO THIS  AGREEMENT  SHALL BE BARRED  UNLESS AN ACTION IS COMMENCED  WITHIN:  (1) TWO (2)  YEARS  FROM THE DATE ON WHICH  THE ACT OR EVENT GIVING  RISE TO THE  CLAIM  OCCURRED  OR (2) ONE (1) YEAR FROM THE DATE ON WHICH FRANCHISEE  OR  PRETZEL  TIME KNEW OR SHOULD  HAVE  KNOWN,  IN THE  EXERCISE  OF REASONABLE  DILIGENCE OF THE FACTS GIVEN RISE TO SUCH CLAIMS,  WHICHEVER  OCCURS FIRST.

More specifically,  Franchisee  acknowledges and agrees that no person acting on behalf of Pretzel Time or its affiliated  companies has made any written or oral claim,  statement,  assurance,  promise or projection of any sort  regarding the actual  or  prospective  sales,  earnings,  gross  profit  or net  profit of the franchise,  which is the subject of this agreement.  Franchisee acknowledges and agrees that Pretzel Time's officers, directors, employees and agents act only in a representative  and not in a personal capacity in connection with any of their dealings with  Franchisee.
