13. CONFIDENTIALITY (a) Obligation: Each Party acknowledges that all Confidential Information consists of confidential and proprietary information of the disclosing Party. Each Party shall, and shall cause its employees, agents and contractors to hold Confidential Information of the other Party in confidence, and shall use the same degree of care by instruction, agreement or otherwise, to maintain the confidentiality of the other Party's Confidential Information that it uses to maintain the confidentiality of its own Confidential Information, but with at least a reasonable degree of care commensurate with the nature and importance of such Confidential Information. Each Party agrees not to make use of Confidential Information other than for the exercise of rights or the performance of obligations under this Agreement (and the Source Code Escrow Agreement), and not to release, disclose, communicate it or make it available to any third person other than employees, agents and contractors of the Party who reasonably need to know it in connection with the exercise of rights or the performance of obligations by such Party under this Agreement (and the Source Code Escrow Agreement) and who are bound by confidentiality and restricted use obligations at least as protective of the Confidential Information as those set forth herein.

The receiving Party agrees that the disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek temporary and permanent injunctive relief to restrain the receiving Party from any unauthorized disclosure or use. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as preventing the disclosing Party from pursuing any and all remedies available to it for a breach or threatened breach of a covenant made in this Section 13, including the recovery of monetary damages from the receiving Party.

FORCE MAJEURE Except for any obligation to make payments, any delay or failure of either Party to perform its obligations under this Agreement or under any Schedule attached hereto shall be excused if, and to the extent, that the delay or failure is caused by an event or occurrence beyond the reasonable control of the Party and without its fault or negligence and that could not have been prevented or avoided by the exercise of reasonable due diligence, such as, by way of example and not by way of limitation, acts of God, action by any Governmental Authority (whether valid or invalid), fires, flood, wind storms, explosions, riots, natural disasters, wars, terrorist acts, sabotage, labour problems (including lock-outs, strikes and slow downs, except for any labour problems of the Party claiming a force majeure event), or court order or injunction; provided that written notice of delay (including anticipated duration of the delay) shall be given by the affected Party to the other Party within two (2) Business Days of the affected Party first becoming aware of such event and the affected Party shall use diligent efforts to end the failure or delay and minimize the effects of such force majeure event. In the event that the force majeure event lasts for fifteen (15) Business Days or longer, either Party shall have the option to terminate this Agreement upon written notice to the other without liability. 19.

(b) Mediation: Either Party may submit a dispute to mediation by providing written notice to the other Party. In the mediation process, the Parties will try to resolve their differences voluntarily with the aid of a single, impartial mediator, who shall attempt to facilitate negotiations. The mediator shall be selected by agreement of the Parties. If the Parties cannot otherwise agree on a mediator within five (5) Business Days, a single mediator shall be designated by the ADR Institute of Canada, Inc. or any successor organization ("ADR") at the request of a Party. Any mediator so designated must not have a conflict of interest with respect to any Party. The mediation shall be conducted as specified by the mediator and agreed upon by the Parties. The Parties agree to discuss their differences in good faith and to attempt, with the assistance of the mediator, to reach an amicable resolution of the dispute. The mediation shall be treated as a settlement discussion and therefore shall be confidential. The mediator may not testify for either Party in any later proceeding relating to the dispute. No recording or transcript shall be made of the mediation proceedings. Each Party shall bear its own costs and legal fees in the mediation. The Parties shall share the fees and expenses of the mediator equally.

The provisions of the Arbitration Act of Ontario, as amended, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement shall govern the arbitration process. The Parties agree to exclude the appeal provisions of the Arbitration Act, as may be amended from time to time, and in particular, section 45 thereof. The determination arising out of the arbitration process shall be final and binding upon the Parties to the arbitration. (d) Exceptions to Arbitration: The following matters shall be excluded from arbitration under this Agreement: (i) any disputes involving third Persons; (ii) breach of confidentiality by either Party; and (iii) intellectual property claims, whether initiated by third Persons or by one of the Parties to this Agreement. 20.
