The University and/or Principal Investigator together with ArTara and the CRO will conduct the Project in accordance with the Project Plan and will use all reasonable endeavors consistent with their expertise to successfully complete the Project. It is the goal of the Project to use the Program Data as clinical support for Product Regulatory Filings and to gain approval to commercialize the Product for the Indication in the Territory. 2.2 Project Plan. The Project Plan as approved by each of the Parties may be modified or amended only upon mutual agreement of each of the Parties. The Project will consist of three phases: (a) Phase I: University and/or Principal Investigator will provide access to the Program Data to ArTara and the CRO at the University's facilities. ArTara and the CRO will be allowed to make complete copies of the original Program Data for the purposes of off-site data entry and storage, all as and only to the extent needed to support ArTara's efforts to accomplish the Project. University will provide ArTara and CRO the opportunity to examine the originals of medical records and supporting records for the Program Data at the University during normal business hours and at mutually agreeable times. University and Principal Investigator will also provide to ArTara contact information for other participating investigators and research sites that have contributed data to the Program. University will retain all Program Data for the sooner to occur of a New Drug Application (NDA) for the Product being approved or ten (10) years from the Effective Date. ArTara will bear any costs related to necessary long-term on or off-site storage of the Program Data, medical records and/or supporting records. ArTara understands that separate engagement agreements may be required by collaborating third party entities and associated principal investigators and University will assist ArTara in obtaining such agreements. It is understood that the goal of Phase I is a feasibility analysis of the Program Data to support Regulatory Filings in the United States. (b) Phase II: University recognizes that because of ArTara's unfamiliarity with the Program Data database, assistance from the Principal Investigator and other research and medical employees of the University may from time to time be needed for ArTara to query and analyze the Program Data database as needed to achieve successful presentation to applicable Regulatory Authorities and submission of Regulatory Filings. ArTara will endeavor to minimize University resources required during Phase II. The goal of Phase II will be to compile the Project Documentation. (c) Phase III: CRO will convert Program Data to eCTD format for submission to Regulatory Authorities. University recognizes that ArTara may receive specific data requests from Regulatory Authorities in connection with ArTara's presentations of Program Data to support Regulatory Filings. University will assist ArTara in responding to such requests for data or access to source data from Regulatory Authorities. ArTara agrees to notify University of such requests as soon as is practicable. The goal of Phase III will be filing of a BLA based on Project Documentation and response to Regulatory Authorities.
