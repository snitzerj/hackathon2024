TouchStar may           include in the Private Label Software a legend to the effect that           TouchStar owns the Private Label Software.

                                       15

     7.3  USE OF TOUCHSTAR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. Reseller shall use the           Intellectual Property Rights only to refer to the TouchStar Software           in accordance with TouchStar's policies as announced from time to           time. In particular, and without limitation, Reseller shall not (a)           remove Trademarks from any Marketing Materials, (b) include any           Trademarks or other Intellectual Property Rights in any promotional           literature prepared by Reseller without the express written consent of           TouchStar; (c) dispute or deny the validity of any of the Intellectual           Property Rights (including any attempt to register or record the same           in any jurisdiction), (d) do any act or omit to do any act whereby           TouchStar's right, title, and interest in the Intellectual Property           Rights may become invalidated or otherwise adversely affected, (e)           alter, remove, destroy, conceal, or tamper with any Trademarks, (f)           use any Intellectual Property Rights in any way which might prejudice           their distinctiveness or validity or goodwill of TouchStar therein,           (g) use in relation to Support Services any patents, copyrights,           trademarks, or trade names other than the Intellectual Property Rights           without TouchStar's prior written consent, or (h) use in the Territory           any trademarks or trade names so resembling any Trademark of TouchStar           as to be likely to cause confusion or deception. Upon expiration or           termination of this Agreement, Reseller shall immediately cease all           use of the Intellectual Property Rights and shall not thereafter use           any of them or any intellectual property rights confusingly similar to           the Intellectual Property Rights.

     7.4  USE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. Reseller acknowledges that it may           receive, during the term of this Agreement, certain Confidential           Information belonging to TouchStar. Reseller recognizes that such           Confidential Information is proprietary to TouchStar and very           valuable, having involved the expenditure of substantial amounts of           money and the use of skilled experts over a long period of time.           Reseller shall hold TouchStar's Confidential Information in strict           confidence and shall not use or disclose any Confidential Information,           or permit any person to examine or copy any Confidential Information,           regardless of the manner in which Reseller gained access to it, except           as necessary for the performance of Reseller's obligations under this           Agreement.





     7.5  PROTECTION OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. Reseller shall protect           TouchStar's Confidential Information with the utmost care and shall           cause its employees, agents, and independent contractors having access           to such Confidential Information to sign confidentiality agreements           requiring them to comply with all the terms of this Article 7.

     7.6  INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS. Reseller shall promptly notify TouchStar of any           known or suspected breach of the Intellectual Property Rights and           shall cooperate (without charge for personal time incurred) in           TouchStar's efforts to protect such TouchStar Intellectual Property           Rights. TouchStar shall defend any action brought against Reseller           based on an allegation that any TouchStar Software infringes a United           States or foreign Patent, Copyright, or Trademark, and TouchStar shall           pay all costs and damages made in settlement or awarded as a result of           any such action. If a final injunction shall be obtained in any such           action restraining use of the TouchStar Software by any Customer, or           if TouchStar believes that any TouchStar Software is

                                       16

          likely to become the subject of a claim of infringement, TouchStar           shall, at its option and at its expense, (a) procure for Reseller's           Customer the right to continue using the TouchStar Software, (b)           replace or modify the TouchStar Software so that it becomes           non-infringing, or (c) repurchase the TouchStar Software on a           depreciated (five-year straight line) basis. Notwithstanding the           foregoing, TouchStar shall have no obligation with respect to any           action brought against Reseller based on an allegation of Patent,           Copyright, or Trademark infringement unless TouchStar is promptly           notified by Reseller in writing of such action and is allowed complete           control of the defense of such action and all negotiations for its           settlement or compromise. This Section 7.6 states TouchStar's entire           liability with respect to infringement of Patents, Copyrights, or           Trademarks.

     7.7  EQUITABLE REMEDIES. Reseller acknowledges that TouchStar will be           irreparably harmed by any breach of the provisions of this Section 7.           Therefore, in addition to any other remedies that TouchStar may have,           TouchStar shall be entitled to an injunction, issued by any court of           competent jurisdiction, wherever located, restraining any violation of           this Section 7 or specified performance if applicable. Reseller hereby           waives, with respect to any future dispute related to this Section 7,           any defense based on the argument that TouchStar will not be           irreparably harmed by a breach or that TouchStar has available to it           an adequate remedy for damages.

     7.8  RESELLER'S OBLIGATIONS AS TO CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AFTER           TERMINATION. All obligations of Reseller relating to TouchStar           Confidential Information shall survive the expiration or termination           of this Agreement. Promptly upon expiration or termination of this           Agreement, Reseller shall not have a right of retention with respect           to, and shall return to TouchStar, all materials in Reseller's           possession or control that represent or contain Confidential           Information, including all memoranda, computer programs, documents,           notes, and every other medium. Reseller shall not retain for its own           use or the use of any third party any such materials or any copies           thereof.

8. TERM AND TERMINATION.

     8.1  TERM OF AGREEMENT. This Agreement shall continue in force for a term           of twelve (12) months from the Effective Date, unless terminated           earlier under the provisions of this Article 8 (the "Term"); PROVIDED           that TouchStar shall have the right to terminate this Agreement at any           time after the Effective Date upon not less than fifteen (15) days'           prior written notice to Reseller. Prior to the end of the Term, each           of TouchStar and Reseller may notify the other if it desires to           negotiate a further agreement by written request received at least           ninety (90) days in advance of the termination of this Agreement. If           both parties desire to negotiate a further agreement, they may           consider the terms of this Agreement in coming to an understanding.           Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to obligate either party           to renew or extend the term of this Agreement. Renewals for additional           terms, if any, shall not cause this Agreement to be construed as an           agreement of indefinite duration.

     8.2  TERMINATION AT TOUCHSTAR OPTION. TouchStar may terminate this           Agreement upon the occurrence and continuation of any of the following           events, with the understanding

                                       17

            (j) Reseller is negligent in the fulfillment of its obligations to                 market and resell the TouchStar Software;

                change of fifty percent (50%) or more of the aggregate voting                 power in Reseller as such existed on and as of the Effective                 Date;

     8.3  SUSPENSION OF TOUCHSTAR OBLIGATIONS. Immediately upon the occurrence           of any breach by Reseller of any of its obligations under this           Agreement or upon the occurrence of any event or circumstance           identified in Section 7.3 of this Agreement, all of TouchStar's           obligations to provide Support Services shall be suspended and such           obligations shall remain suspended until the event or circumstance           giving rise to the suspension has been corrected to TouchStar's           satisfaction.

     8.4  SURVIVAL OF RESELLER OBLIGATIONS. The termination of this Agreement           shall not terminate or affect the continuing binding obligations           imposed by Sections 4.4, 4.7, 4.10, 4.12, and 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10           this Agreement. It is understood and agreed that the obligations of           Reseller set forth in such provisions may be specifically enforced by           TouchStar in any court of competent jurisdiction, wherever located,           notwithstanding the provisions of Section 10.12(b) hereof, since no           other adequate remedy may exist in the event of a breach or threatened           breach by Reseller of any such provisions.

9. DUTIES UPON TERMINATION.

         In addition to any other provision of this Agreement which is designated in Section 8.6 as a provision surviving termination, the following shall apply:

     9.1  CUSTOMER AGREEMENTS.

            (a) In the event that (i) TouchStar terminates this Agreement in                 accordance with any one or more of the provisions of Section 8.2                 or (ii) Reseller elects not to enter into a new agreement with





                TouchStar pursuant to Section 8.1, all Customer Agreements with                 Customers shall be transferred by Reseller to TouchStar.

            (b) In the event that (i) TouchStar elects not to enter into a new                 agreement with Reseller pursuant to Section 8.2 or (ii) Reseller                 terminates this Agreement in accordance with the provisions of                 Section 8.3, Reseller shall retain all Customer Agreements with                 Customers and TouchStar shall continue to provide Support                 Services under such Customer Agreements for the remaining term                 of such Customer Agreements.

&bbsp;                                      19

     9.2  REFERRALS BY RESELLER. In the event that (a) TouchStar terminates this           Agreement in accordance with any one or more of the provisions of           Section 8.2 or (b) Reseller elects not to enter into a new agreement           with TouchStar pursuant to Section 8.1, Reseller shall refer to           TouchStar or TouchStar's designee all inquiries and orders received by           Reseller pertaining to the purchase of Support Services.

     9.3  PAYMENT OF FEES.

            (a) In the event that this Agreement terminates or expires pursuant                 to Section 8.1(a), Reseller immediately shall pay to TouchStar                 all Fees outstanding on and as of the date of termination or                 expiration of this Agreement.

            (b) In the event that this Agreement terminates or expires pursuant                 to Section 8.1(b), Reseller shall continue to pay all Fees in                 accordance with the provisions of Section 6.2.

     9.4  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. Reseller immediately shall stop the use           of Marketing Materials and Intellectual Property Rights, and shall           return any unused Marketing Materials and all physical media upon           which Intellectual Property Rights are contained by TouchStar.

     9.5  SHIPMENTS FOLLOWING NOTICE OF TERMINATION. The expiration or           termination of this Agreement shall not relieve TouchStar of its           continuing obligation to ship TouchStar Software pursuant to any           purchase orders accepted by TouchStar prior to the notice of           termination, nor shall it relieve Reseller of its continuing           obligation to accept and pay for such TouchStar Software; PROVIDED,           HOWEVER, that with respect to all TouchStar Software shipped after any           notice of termination, Reseller shall make payment prior to shipment           on terms and conditions and by means satisfactory to TouchStar,           notwithstanding any credit terms that may have been available to           Reseller prior to such notice of termination.

     9.6  LIABILITY UPON TERMINATION. TouchStar shall have no liability to           Reseller or any Other Reseller by reason of the termination or           expiration of this Agreement for compensation, reimbursement, or           damages of any kind, including any loss of prospective profits on           anticipated sales, loss of goodwill, or investments made in reliance           on this Agreement. Reseller acknowledges that it has received no           assurances from TouchStar that its business relationship with           TouchStar will continue beyond the term established in this Agreement,           or that it will obtain any anticipated amounts of profits in           connection with this Agreement, or that it will recoup its investment           in the promotion of the TouchStar Software. Reseller also acknowledges           that Reseller's failure to reach the Quotas will have a significant           adverse impact on TouchStar's goodwill in the Territory, and that if           Reseller is terminated because of failure to meet the Quotas, then           Reseller will not be entitled to compensation of any kind (beyond the           notice period set forth in this Agreement), since the damage to      &sbsp;    TouchStar's goodwill is likely to be at least as great as any losses           Reseller might incur as a result of the termination. However, these           provisions apply only to damages that are attributable to the           expiration or termination of this Agreement and shall not affect any           amount due

                                       20

          under this Agreement or the right of either party to seek damages           directly attributable to any breach.

10. GENERAL PROVISIONS.

     10.1 RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PARTIES. Neither party to this Agreement and           none of their respective agents, employees, representatives or           independent contractors shall (a) be considered an agent, employee, or           representative of the other party for any purpose whatsoever, (b) have           any authority to make any agreement or commitment for the other party           or to incur liability or obligation in the other party's name or on           its behalf, or (c) represent to third parties that any of them has any           right so to bind the other party hereto, it being intended that each           party shall remain an independent contractor responsible only for its           own actions.

     10.3 NOTICES. Without precluding any other sufficient form of notice, all           notices, demands, or other communications under this Agreement shall           be deemed given if sent by registered airmail, facsimile, hand           delivery, or express courier to the address of the party as set out in           this Agreement or to another address specified by the party.

No           supplement, modification, or amendment of this Agreement shall be           binding unless executed in writing by both parties.

     10.5 WAIVER. Either party's failure to insist on strict performance of any           provision of this Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of any of its           rights or remedies, nor shall it relieve the other party from           performing any subsequent obligation strictly in

                                       21

          accordance with the terms of this Agreement. No waiver shall be           effective unless it is in writing and signed by the party against whom           enforcement is sought. Such waiver shall be limited to provisions of           this Agreement specifically referred to therein and shall not be           deemed a waiver of any other provision. No waiver shall constitute a           continuing waiver unless the writing states otherwise.

     10.6 SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of,           and shall be binding upon, the respective heirs, legal           representatives, successors, and assigns of each of the parties.

                  (i)   The arbitration shall be conducted before a panel of                         three (3) arbitrators, each of whom shall be fluent in                         English and shall have knowledge in the call center                         industry.

The third arbitrator, regardless of how selected, shall                         chair the arbitration panel.

                  (ii)  Once the arbitrators are impaneled, if (A) an arbitrator                         withdraws after a challenge, (B) the administrator                         sustains a challenge and removes an arbitrator, (C) an                         arbitrator dies, or (D) an arbitrator otherwise resigns                         or is removed, then the party which appointed such                         arbitrator shall appoint a replacement arbitrator within                         thirty (30) days in accordance with the procedures set                         forth in Section 10.12(b)(i).

The arbitration shall be conducted in                         English; PROVIDED, that either party, at its cost, may                         provide for the simultaneous translation of the                         arbitration into a language other than English.

                  (iv)  No less than thirty (30) days prior to the date on which                         the arbitration proceeding is to begin, each party shall                         submit to the other party the documents, in English, and                         list of witnesses it

                  (v)   The arbitrators shall apply the substantive law of the                         State of Colorado to any decision issued by the                         arbitration panel, and the arbitrators shall be so                         instructed. The arbitrators shall issue a written                         opinion stating the findings of fact and the conclusions                         of law upon which the decision is based. The decision of                         the arbitrators shall be final and binding. Judgment on                         such award may be entered in any court of appropriate                         jurisdiction, or application may be made to that court                         for a judicial acceptance of the award and an order of                         enforcement, as the party seeking to enforce that award                         may elect. Any arbitration award for money damages shall                         be in Dollars.

                  (vi)  Any arbitration award pursuant to this Section 10.12(b)                         shall be subject to the United Nations Convention on the
