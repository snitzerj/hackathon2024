We are in the business of franchising outlets that sell proprietary gourmet soups, chilis, stews, desserts, wraps and non-proprietary products like salads, sandwiches, specialty coffees, soft drinks and other beverages under the name and trademark "The Original Soupman", together with any trademarks, trade names, service marks, slogans and logos which may be authorized in writing by us from time to time (collectively the "Proprietary Marks"). We have developed and used, and continue to use and control, the Proprietary Marks so as to impart to the public superior standards of quality and service.   B. You desire us to grant you a license to use the methods, procedures and products developed by us and our parent (the "System") to operate an independent business (the "Franchised Business") that sells and services The Original Soupman franchises ("Unit Franchises") to qualified individuals and business entities ("Unit Franchisees") who will sell proprietary gourmet soups, chilis, stews, desserts, wraps and non- proprietary products like salads, sandwiches, specialty coffees, soft drinks and other beverages in the territory described in Section 1 of this Agreement, and you agree that your operation of the Franchised Business shall be governed by the terms, covenants and conditions contained in this Agreement. Our System includes a method of offering and selling Unit Franchises, management methods, marketing programs, financial reporting, Unit Franchisee performance reporting, and providing services to Unit Franchisees, all of which we may modify and/or update from time to time during the term of this Agreement.   C. You represent and warrant to us, as an inducement to our execution of this Agreement, that all statements made by you and all materials provided to us by you in connection with the grant of this franchise to you are true, accurate and complete and that you have made no misrepresentations or material omissions in connection with obtaining this franchise. We grant this franchise in reliance upon each and all of your representations.   NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS AGREED:   1. GRANT OF FRANCHISE   1.1 Rights Granted to You   We grant to you, upon the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement, the exclusive right to establish and operate a Franchised Business and a license to use the methods, procedures and products developed by us in the business of selling and servicing Unit Franchises in the territory described on Attachment A attached to this Agreement and incorporated into this Agreement by reference (the "Master Territory").

  3.3 Renewal of Existing Agreement   If we are not offering new master franchises, are in the process of revising, amending or renewing our form of Master Franchise Agreement or Master Franchise Disclosure Document or are not lawfully able to offer our then-current form of Master Franchise Agreement at the time you exercise an option to extend the term of this Agreement, we may offer to renew this Agreement upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement for the extended term, or may offer to extend the term of this Agreement on a month-to-month basis following the expiration of the term of this Agreement for as long as we deem necessary or appropriate so that we may subsequently lawfully offer and utilize our then-current form of Master Franchise Agreement.   3.4 Continued Compliance   Your right to extend the term of this Agreement shall be subject to your continued compliance with the terms and conditions in this Agreement as well as your compliance with the conditions set forth in Section 3.2 of this Agreement.   3.5 Termination at End of Term   If you do not elect to extend the term of this Agreement, this Agreement shall terminate at the end of the term then in effect.   4. PAYMENT OF FEES   4.1 Continuing Fees Payable to Us   You shall pay the following continuing fees to us each month during the term of this Agreement:   4.2.1 You shall pay to us a royalty fee based on revenue generated by Unit Franchisees (the "Unit Franchise Performance Royalty Fee") equal to twenty-five percent (25%) of aggregate royalty fees paid to you by Unit Franchisees in the Master Territory pursuant to their Unit Franchise Agreements. The Unit Franchise Performance Royalty Fee shall be paid by you to us in the manner provided in Section 4.3 of this Agreement by the fifteenth(15 th ) day of each calendar month based on royalty fees generated and received during the previous calendar month.   4.2.2 You shall pay to us a franchise sales royalty fee (the "Franchise Sales Royalty Fee") for each Unit Franchise you sell in the Master Territory as follows: twenty-five percent (25%) of the initial franchise fee collected from each Unit Franchisee upon execution of the Unit Franchisee's Franchise Agreement (a "Unit Franchise Agreement"); provided, however, that if you elect to discount or reduce an initial franchise fee for any reason, the Franchise Sales Royalty Fee shall be payable to us as if the full initial franchise fee had been paid. The Franchise Sales Royalty Fee shall be paid by you to us at the same time and in the same manner as the Unit Franchise Performance Royalty Fee provided in Section 4.2.1 above. Any Royalty Fee you collect from the Franchisee shall be immediately paid to Us, but no later than the fifteen (15  th ) day of each calendar month. A Unit Franchise shall be deemed to be sold to a Unit Franchisee on the date that you and the Unit Franchisee execute the Unit Franchise Agreement, irrespective of when the Unit Franchise begins operation. Fees and Royalties cannot be increased or decreased without our prior written consent.

  4.2.3 In addition to the Unit Franchise Performance Royalty Fee and Franchise Sales Royalty Fee described above, you shall collect from each Unit Franchisee in your Master Territory a "National Advertising Fund Contribution" to be contributed to our "National Advertising Fund" pursuant to the terms of the individual Unit Franchise Agreements. For each Unit Franchise you own and operate, you shall pay the National Advertising Fund Contribution on the same basis as Unit Franchisees. The National Advertising Fund Contribution shall be collected by you from each Unit Franchisee and spent by you in accordance with the agreement on behalf of the franchisor and Franchisees.   4.3 Manner of Payment   You shall pay us all Unit Franchise Performance Royalty Fees and Franchise Sales Royalty Fees, due under this Section 4 by electronic funds transfer by us against a bank account maintained by you. You agree to execute the documents required by us, our bank and/or your bank in order to permit us to conduct electronic funds transfers to and from your account, and you shall not close your account without our prior consent. Your failure to comply with the terms of this Section 4.3 shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement. You hereby authorize us to initiate debit entries and/or credit collection entries to your bank account for the payment of Unit Franchise Performance Royalty Fees, Franchise Sales Royalty Fees, National Advertising Fund Contributions, and all other sums that may become due to us or our affiliates from you. You shall make funds available for withdrawal by us by electronic transfer on such dates of each month as we shall designate throughout the term of this Agreement.   If you fail to provide the revenue reports described in Section 4.6 below, then in addition to the late fee described in such Section, we may debit your account for one hundred forty percent (140%) of the last Unit Franchise Performance Royalty Fee, Franchise Sales Royalty Fee and/or National Advertising Fund Contribution (as applicable) that we debited. If the Unit Franchise Performance Royalty Fee, Franchise Sales Royalty Fee and/or National Advertising Fund Contribution we debit are less than the fees you actually owe us, once we have been able to determine the true and correct revenue amounts, we will debit your account for the balance on a day we specify. If the Unit Franchise Performance Royalty Fee, Franchise Sales Royalty Fee and/or National Advertising Fund Contribution we debit are greater than the fees you actually owe us, we will credit the excess against the amount we otherwise would debit from your account for the next payment due.   4.4 Interest on Overdue Amounts   Any payment not actually received by us on or before the Fifteen (15 th ) day of each month (or the next business day if the Fifteen(15 th ) of any month is not a business day) shall be deemed overdue and you shall pay to us, in addition to the overdue payment, interest on such overdue amount at the rate of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is less. Interest shall accrue from the original due date until payment is received in full. Our right to such interest shall be in addition to any other remedies we may have, including, without limitation, the right of set-off to withdraw or retain, from time to time and without notice to you, any amounts due and unpaid by us to you. You shall not be entitled to set-off any payments required to be made under this Section 4 against any monetary claim you may have against us.

  4.5 Late Fee; Insufficient Funds Fee   In the event you fail to provide us with any report we require on or before the date we require it, you agree to pay to us a late fee in the amount of Two Hundred Fifty Dollars ($250). In addition, if, for any reason, any payment owed by you to us is denied by your bank due to insufficient funds in your account, then you shall, in addition to applicable interest as described in Section 4.4 above, pay us an insufficient funds fee in the amount of Two Hundred Fifty Dollars ($250). If you incur three (3) late fees or insufficient funds fees within any twelve (12) month period, we will have the right to terminate this Agreement without providing you an opportunity to cure the default.   4.6 Unit Franchise Agreements and Revenue Reports   You shall submit to us copies of all Unit Franchise Agreements executed with Unit Franchisees within ten (10) days of the date of their execution, together with a copy of all checks presented to you at closing. You shall prepare and submit to us a monthly report, not later than the first (1 s t ) day of each month, of Franchise Sales Revenue generated by you during the previous calendar month. Contemporaneously with the submission of the Franchise Sales Revenue report, you shall prepare and submit to us a monthly report, in such form and including such detail as we require, reflecting royalty fees paid and owed to you by your Unit Franchisees for the previous calendar month. Any report not actually received by us when due shall be deemed overdue and you shall pay us a late charge as described above.   4.7 Security Interest   In order to secure payment of all Unit Franchise Performance Royalty Fees, Franchise Sales Royalty Fees, National Advertising Fund Contributions, and all other sums that may become due to us or our affiliates from you under this Agreement, and to secure your performance of all obligations of any kind, whenever and however incurred, in favor of us or our affiliates:   4.7.1 You hereby grant us a security interest in and to all equipment, furniture, fixtures, inventory, supplies and vehicles used in connection with the Franchised Business, now or hereafter acquired by you, together with all accounts, payment intangibles, attachments, accessories, additions, substitutions and replacements, all cash and non-cash proceeds derived from insurance or the disposition of such assets, all of your rights to use the Proprietary Marks, patents, copyrights and their registrations, trade secret information and other proprietary rights, and all rights granted, owned or licensed to you under this Agreement for the use of the Proprietary Marks, trade names, trade styles, patents, copyrights, trade secret information and other proprietary rights. You hereby authorize us to prepare and file all Uniform Commercial Code ("UCC") financing statements and other documents necessary or desirable to evidence, perfect and continue the priority of this security interest under the UCC.   4.7.2 If you are and remain in good standing under this Agreement and all other agreements with us and our affiliates, we will consent to your grant of an additional security interest in the Franchised Business or in any of the assets of the Franchised Business if the conditions set forth in Section 12.4 of this Agreement are met.   4.7.3 If you are in default of any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement or any other agreements between us and our affiliates and you, we may, in our sole and absolute discretion, exercise our rights with respect to our security interest. In such event, you shall be and remain liable for any deficiency remaining due to us and shall be entitled to recover any surplus which results after application of the proceeds derived from the enforcement of our security interest.

You shall pay all costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by us in the enforcement of this Section 7.   7.5 Irreparable Injury   You acknowledge and agree that any violation of the terms of this Section 7 would result in irreparable injury to us, for which no adequate remedy at law may be available, and you consent that we may apply for the issuance of an injunction prohibiting any conduct by you in violation of this Section 7, without the posting of any bond.   7.6 Additional Parties   At our request, you shall require and obtain execution of covenants similar to those set forth in this Section 7 (including covenants applicable upon the termination of a person's relationship with you) from any or all principals of yours and other personnel employed by you who have received or will receive training from us or from you. Every covenant required by this Section 7.6 shall be in a form satisfactory to us, including, without limitation, specific identification of us as a third party beneficiary of such covenants with an independent right to enforce them.

  In each of the foregoing cases, we (and any of our affiliates) will have all remedies allowed at law, including termination of your rights (and/or those of any person/company affiliated with you) and our (and/or our affiliates') obligations.

  11. OBLIGATIONS UPON TERMINATION OR EXPIRATION   Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, all rights granted under this Agreement to you shall forthwith terminate and:   11.1 Cessation of Business   You shall immediately cease to operate the Franchised Business, and shall not thereafter, directly or indirectly, represent to the public or hold yourself out as a present or former master franchisee of ours.   11.2 Cessation of Use of Confidential Information and Proprietary Marks   You shall immediately and permanently cease to use, by advertising or in any other manner whatsoever, any confidential methods, procedures, and techniques associated with the System, and all Proprietary Marks and distinctive forms, slogans, signs, symbols, and devices associated with the System.   11.3 Cancellation of Assumed Name Registration   You shall take such action as may be necessary to cancel any assumed name registration or equivalent registration obtained by you which contains the Proprietary Marks; and you shall furnish us with evidence satisfactory to us of compliance with this obligation within thirty (30) days after termination or expiration of this Agreement.   11.4 Payment of Monies Due; Liquidated Damages   11.4.1 You shall promptly pay all sums owing to us and our affiliates. In the event of termination for any default of yours, such sums shall include all damages, costs, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred by us as a result of the default, which obligation shall give rise to and remain, until paid in full, a lien in our favor against any and all leasehold improvements, fixtures, furnishings and equipment, inventory, supplies and vehicles located at or used in connection with the Franchised Business, together with all accounts, payment intangibles, attachments, accessories, additions, substitutions and replacements, all cash and non-cash proceeds derived from insurance or the disposition of such assets, all your rights to use the Proprietary Marks, patents, copyrights and their registrations, trade secret information and other proprietary rights, and all rights granted, owned or licensed to you under this Agreement for the use of the Proprietary Marks, trade names, trade styles, patents, copyrights, trade secret information and other proprietary rights. We shall have full power and authority to file such documents as are necessary to obtain and perfect such lien. We shall have the right to set off any amounts which we deem are payable to us by you.   11.4.2 In addition to the foregoing, upon termination of this Agreement by us for cause as described in Section 10, you agree to pay to us within fifteen (15) days after the effective date of this Agreement's termination, in addition to the amounts owed hereunder, liquidated damages equal to the average monthly Unit Franchise Performance Royalty Fee and Franchise Sales Royalty Fee you paid during the twelve (12) months of operation preceding the effective date of termination multiplied by (a) twenty-four (24) (being the number of months in two (2) full years), or (b) the number of months remaining in the Agreement had it not been terminated, whichever is lower.   11.4.3 The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that it would be impracticable to determine precisely the damages we would incur from this Agreement's termination and the loss of cash flow from Royalty Fees due to, among other things, the complications of determining what costs, if any, we might have saved and how much the Royalty Fees would have grown over what would have been this Agreement's remaining term. The parties hereto consider this liquidated damages provision to be a reasonable, good faith pre-estimate of those damages.   11.4.4 The liquidated damages provision only covers our damages from the loss of cash flow from the Royalty Fees. It does not cover any other damages, including damages to our reputation with the public and landlords and damages arising from a violation of any provision of this Agreement other than the Royalty Fee sections. You and each of your principals agree that the liquidated damages provision does not give us an adequate remedy at law for any default under, or for the enforcement of, any provision of this Agreement other than the Royalty Fee sections.

  11.5 Costs to Secure Compliance   You shall pay to us all damages, costs, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred by us prior or subsequent to the termination or expiration of the franchise herein granted in obtaining injunctive or other relief for the enforcement of any provisions of this Section 11.   11.6 Return of Manuals and Other Confidential Information   You shall immediately deliver to us the Manuals and all other records, correspondence, files, and any instructions containing confidential information relating to the operation of the Franchised Business which are in your possession, and all copies thereof, all of which are acknowledged to be our property.   11.7 Irreparable Injury to Us   You agree and acknowledge that your failure to comply with the provisions of this Section 11 will result in irreparable harm to us and to the Proprietary Marks, and you agree to pay all damages, expenses, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred by us in obtaining specific performance of, or an injunction against violation of, and/or damages resulting from a violation of, the requirements of this Section 11.   11.8 Compliance with Post-Term Covenants   All of your covenants, obligations, and agreements which by their terms or by reasonable implication are to be performed, in whole or in part, after the termination or expiration of this Agreement, shall survive such termination or expiration.   12. TRANSFER OF INTEREST   12.1 Transfer by Us   We shall have the right to assign this Agreement and all of our attendant rights and privileges to any person, firm, corporation or other entity provided that, with respect to any assignment resulting in the subsequent performance by the assignee of our functions: (i) the assignee shall, at the time of such assignment, be financially responsible and economically capable of performing our obligations; and (ii) the assignee shall expressly assume and agree to perform such obligations.

  12.2 Transfer by You   You understand and acknowledge that the rights and duties set forth in this Agreement are personal to you, and that we have granted this franchise in reliance on your (or, if you are a corporation, partnership, or limited liability company, your principals') business skill, financial capacity, and personal character. Accordingly, neither you nor any immediate or remote successor to any part of your interest in this Agreement, nor any individual, partnership, corporation, or other legal entity which directly or indirectly owns any interest in you shall not sell, encumber, assign, transfer, convey, pledge, merge, or give away any direct or indirect interest in this Agreement, in you, or in all or substantially all of the assets of the Franchised Business. Any change in the control of you shall be deemed a transfer for purposes of this Agreement. Any purported assignment or transfer shall be null and void and shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement, for which we may immediately terminate without opportunity to cure pursuant to Section 10.2.3 of this Agreement.   12.3 Granting of a Security Interest by You   You shall not grant a security interest in the Franchised Business or in any of the assets of the Franchised Business without first obtaining our prior written consent. Our consent or refusal to consent may be based upon whatever factors we, in our sole discretion, deem economically and commercially reasonable in protecting our interests and security interest under this Agreement and the relationship created under this Agreement; however, if you are in good standing under this Agreement and all other agreements between us or our affiliates and you, we shall, upon your written request, execute a written subordination of our security interest to lenders and/or lessors providing financing for the Franchised Business. Under any circumstances however, we shall not consent to any such granting of a security interest unless all of the following conditions are met:   12.3.1 Such security is granted only for the purpose of securing a loan in your favor, which loan shall only be for the benefit of the Franchised Business.   12.3.2 In the event of any default by you under any documents in any way relating to the security interest or the loan to which it relates, we shall have the right at our sole option (but not the obligation) to cure any such default and/or to be substituted as obligor to the lender whose interests are secured by such security interest.   12.3.3 In the event of any such default, and if we choose to be substituted as obligor, we shall be so substituted in all respects on the same terms and conditions to which you were subject, except that any acceleration of the obligations secured, due to your default, shall be void upon cure by us.   12.3.4 Such other conditions and terms as we shall deem necessary and/or prudent to protect our interests under this Agreement.   12.4 Transfer Upon Death or Disability   Upon the death or permanent disability (mental or physical) of any person with an interest in this Agreement, in you, or in all or substantially all of the assets of the Franchised Business, the executor, administrator, or personal representative of such person shall transfer such interest to a third party approved by us within twelve (12) months after such death or disability. Such transfers, including, without limitation, transfers by devise or inheritance, shall be subject to the same conditions as any inter vivos transfer, except that the transfer fee shall be waived. In the case of transfer by devise or inheritance, however, if the heirs or beneficiaries of any such person are unable to meet the conditions of this Section 12, the executor, administrator, or personal representative of the decedent shall transfer the decedent's interest to another party approved by us within twelve (12) months, which disposition shall be subject to all the terms and conditions for transfers contained in this Agreement. We may, at our option, assume management and control of the Franchised Business during such twelve (12) month period and shall be paid a reasonable monthly management fee for our services as determined by us. If the interest is not disposed of within such period, we may, at our option, terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.2.4 of this Agreement.

For the purpose of this Section 14.4, the term "losses and expenses" shall be deemed to include compensatory, exemplary, or punitive damages; fines and penalties; attorneys' fees; experts' fees; court costs; costs associated with investigating and defending against claims; settlement amounts; judgments; compensation for damages to our reputation and goodwill; and all other costs associated with any of the foregoing losses and expenses. You shall give us prompt notice of any event of which you are aware for which indemnification is required and, at your expense and risk, we may elect to assume (but under no circumstance are obligated to undertake) the defense and/or settlement thereof, provided that we will seek your advice and counsel. Any assumption of ours shall not modify your indemnification obligation. We may, in our sole judgment, take such actions as we deem necessary and appropriate to investigate, defend, or settle any event or take other remedial or corrective actions with respect thereto as may be, in our sole judgment, necessary for the protection of the Indemnitees or the System. You shall defend us and each of our affiliates, officers, directors, shareholders, agents, and employees named in any lawsuit based on such loss or expenses and shall pay all costs and reasonable attorneys' fees associated with such defense. If we wish to retain our own counsel to defend any such action, you shall reimburse us for all reasonable costs and legal fees incurred by us for such defense. Said reimbursement shall be made to us in a timely manner upon demand as such fees are incurred by us and billed to you.

You acknowledge that you are entering into this Agreement, and any ancillary agreements executed contemporaneously herewith, as a result of your own independent investigation of the business franchised hereby and not as a result of any representation made by us or persons associated with us, or other franchisees, which are contrary to the terms herein set forth or which are contrary to the terms of any Franchise Disclosure Document or other similar document required or permitted to be given to you pursuant to applicable law. Except for those permitted under this Agreement to be made unilaterally by us, no amendment, change, or variation from this Agreement shall be binding on either party unless mutually agreed to by the parties and executed by their authorized officers or agents in writing. Nothing in this Section 16.1 is intended to disclaim, or require you to waive reliance on, any representation made in the Franchise Disclosure Document (the "FDD") that we have provided to you, except with respect to specific contract terms and conditions set forth in the FDD that you have voluntarily waived during the course of franchise-sale negotiations.   16.2 Severability and Construction   Except as expressly provided to the contrary herein, each section, paragraph, part, term, and provision of this Agreement shall be considered severable; and if, for any reason, any section, paragraph, part, term, provision, and/or covenant herein is determined to be invalid and contrary to, or in conflict with, any existing or future law or regulation by a court or agency having valid jurisdiction, such shall not impair the operation of, or have any other effect upon, such other portions, sections, paragraphs, parts, terms, provisions, and/or covenants of this Agreement as may remain otherwise intelligible; and the latter shall continue to be given full force and effect and bind the parties hereto; and the invalid portions, sections, paragraphs, parts, terms, provisions, and/or covenants shall be deemed not to be a part of this Agreement.

We and you intend that if any provision of this Agreement is susceptible to two or more constructions, one of which would render the provision enforceable and the other or others of which would render the provision unenforceable, the provision shall be given the meaning that renders it enforceable.   33
