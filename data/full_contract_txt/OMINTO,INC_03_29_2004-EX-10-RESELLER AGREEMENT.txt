PROCEDURE FOR REGISTERING PROSPECTIVE          CLIENTS, MEMBER PROVIDERS/ MERCHANTS/MERCHANT MEMBER PROVIDERS

This Addendum is attached hereto and made a part hereof that certain Reseller or Master Reseller Agreement between the parties:

MEDIANET GROUP (MNG) HAS DEVELOPED A SET OF CRITERIA DESIGNED TO AVOID ANY POTENTIAL PROSPECT REGISTRATION DISPUTES AND TO ASSURE OUR RESELLERS FULL COMMISSION ON SALES MADE BY THEM. TO INSURE THIS GOAL, WE HAVE CREATED CRITERIA THAT MUST BE FOLLOWED FOR REGISTRATION OF THE COMPANIES (PROSPECTS) INTRODUCED TO THE BSP REWARDS PROGRAM.

1. Resellers must send us an E-mail with the company name, contact and title that you wish to register with the Company. Said contact must have the authority to make the decision relative to the Brand-A-Port and/or BSP programs.

2. MNG will send an e-mail to the Reseller approving or disapproving the registration of the prospective client dependent upon whether or not there has been prior contact by the company, registration of the prospect by another Reseller or other factors as determined by the MNG.

3. Upon approval by MNG, the Reseller will have 30 days to initiate and complete a proposal to said prospect. The proposal must be approved by MNG and receipt confirmed by the prospect.

4. The Reseller will then have 5 months to bring the registered prospect to contract. If a contract is not consummated in the allotted time-frame, the prospect shall then revert back to MNG. Reseller may then re-register the prospect subject to the above criteria and/or other criteria in effect at the time.

The above criteria points are firm unless a special situation is approved by MNG in writing.

WE BELIEVE THAT EACH REPRESENTATIVE AND RESELLER WILL SEE THE BENEFITS OF THIS PROGRAM AND THE PROTECTION IT AFFORDS THEM.

APPROVED AND ACCEPTED BY THE SIGNATORY PARTIES BELOW THIS __ OF ________, 200__.
