No amendment to or modification of this Agreement is effective unless it is in writing and signed by an authorized representative of each party. No waiver by any party of any of the provisions hereof shall be effective unless explicitly set forth in writing and signed by the party so waiving. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, no failure to exercise, or delay in exercising, any rights, remedy, power or privilege arising from this Agreement shall operate or be construed as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege.   11.10 Severability. If any term or provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision of this Agreement or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in any other jurisdiction. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.   11.11 Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Nevada without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule.   11.12 Dispute Resolution. In the event of a dispute arising out of this Agreement, the parties shall first negotiate in good faith in an effort to reach a settlement of the dispute. If having negotiated in good faith, the parties are unable to resolve their dispute, the parties shall submit the dispute to binding arbitration by a single arbitrator. The arbitration shall be governed by the Commercial Rules of Arbitration of the American Arbitration Association. The arbitration shall take place at an agreed location, or if the parties cannot agree on a venue in Reno, Nevada or Vancouver, BC, as determined by the flip of a coin. The arbitrator shall have jurisdiction over the conduct of discovery prior to the hearing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 11.13 shall be construed to prohibit either party from seeking appropriate injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction.
