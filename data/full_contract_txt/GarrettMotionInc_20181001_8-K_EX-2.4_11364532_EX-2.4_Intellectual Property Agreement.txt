Table of Contents

to the Honeywell Shared IP, the Parties seek to ensure that SpinCo has the freedom to use such Honeywell Shared IP in the future. Hence, as of the Distribution Date, Honeywell hereby grants, and agrees to cause the members of the Honeywell Group to hereby grant, to SpinCo and the members of the SpinCo Group a non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully-paid, perpetual, sublicenseable (solely to Subsidiaries and suppliers for "have-made" purposes), worldwide license to use and exercise rights under the Honeywell Shared IP (excluding Trademarks, the Honeywell Content and the subject matter of any other Ancillary Agreement), said license being limited to use of a similar type, scope and extent as used in the SpinCo Business prior to the Distribution Date and the natural growth and development thereof.

(b) Trademarks. The Parties acknowledge and agree that certain rights and obligations with respect to the use by the SpinCo Group of certain Honeywell Trademarks shall be set forth in the Trademark License Agreement. To the extent there is a conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the Trademark License Agreement, the terms of the Trademark License Agreement shall control.

(c) Additional Licenses. For a period of five (5) years after the Distribution Date, in the event any member of the SpinCo Group, in SpinCo's reasonable judgment, requires a license under any Honeywell IP in order to initiate and pursue any new technical projects not covered by the licenses granted in Section 3.01(a), the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to license such Honeywell IP to the applicable member of the SpinCo Group on commercially reasonable terms. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, if the Parties cannot reach agreement with respect to the terms of a license to Honeywell IP pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, the applicable member of the SpinCo Group shall be permitted to challenge the validity or enforceability of such Honeywell IP (it being understood that such challenge is the sole remedy available to SpinCo in the event Honeywell does not grant such license, without regard to whether Honeywell has negotiated in good faith).

Section 3.02. Other Covenants.

(a) Honeywell hereby acknowledges (on behalf of itself and each other member of the Honeywell Group) SpinCo's right, title and interest in and to the SpinCo IP. Honeywell agrees that it will not, and agrees to cause each member of the Honeywell Group not to, (i) initiate any Action against any member of the SpinCo Group or its Affiliates for infringement, misappropriation or other violation of any Honeywell IP, (ii) oppose, challenge, petition to cancel, contest or threaten in any way, or assist another party in opposing, challenging, petitioning to cancel, contesting or threatening in any way, any application or registration by SpinCo or its Affiliates or their respective licensees for any SpinCo IP, the use of which is consistent with the use of such SpinCo IP in connection with the SpinCo Business as of immediately prior to the Distribution Date, (iii) engage in any act, or purposefully omit to perform any act, that impairs or adversely affects the rights of SpinCo or any member of the SpinCo Group in and to any SpinCo IP or (iv) apply for any registration with respect to the SpinCo IP (including federal, state and national registrations), in each case of the foregoing clauses (i) - (iv) for a period of five (5) years after the Distribution Date, without the prior written consent of SpinCo, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. 5

(b) SpinCo shall be responsible for policing, protecting and enforcing its own Intellectual Property Rights. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Honeywell will promptly give notice to SpinCo of any actual or threatened, unauthorized use or infringement of the SpinCo IP of which it receives notice, in each case for a period of five (5) years after the Distribution Date.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3.02, each member of the Honeywell Group shall be permitted to challenge the validity or enforceability of SpinCo IP, in each case solely in response to an Action initiated by a third party where failure to assert such challenge would reasonably be expected to materially prejudice any member of the Honeywell Group's defense to such Action; provided, that the applicable member(s) of the Honeywell Group shall use reasonable best efforts to provide SpinCo with reasonable written notice prior to initiating any such challenge.

(d) All SpinCo Trade Secrets shall be in or shall be moved to the physical possession of the SpinCo Group in a tangible form (including all copies thereof and all notes, extracts or summaries based thereon) prior to the Distribution Date. At the specific written request of SpinCo, Honeywell shall destroy or shall have destroyed any form or copy of any SpinCo Trade Secrets specified by SpinCo in such written request that are in the possession of Honeywell or any members of the Honeywell Group and were not used in the Honeywell Business as of immediately prior to the Distribution, other than SpinCo Trade Secrets that were electronically preserved or recorded by an electronic backup system prior to the Distribution Date and remain within a secure, encrypted data backup system that is subject to industry practice defense, protection and access restriction measures.

Section 3.03. Honeywell Content.

(a) Notwithstanding Section 3.01, Honeywell hereby grants, and agrees to cause the members of the Honeywell Group to hereby grant, to SpinCo and the members of the SpinCo Group, for a period of ten (10) years after the Distribution Date (unless earlier terminated in accordance with Section 3.03(c)), a non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully-paid, non-sublicenseable, non-transferable, worldwide license to use and reproduce the Honeywell Content solely for the SpinCo Group's internal business purposes. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties acknowledge and agree that SpinCo may distribute the Honeywell Content internally through SpinCo's intranet in the same form and manner that it was distributed on the Honeywell intranet immediately prior to the Distribution Date; provided, that the Honeywell Content may not be used for any purpose other than the SpinCo Group's internal business purposes and may not be shared with any third party without the prior written consent of Honeywell.

(b) SpinCo shall, and shall cause each member of the SpinCo Group to, remove any Honeywell Trademarks or reference to the Honeywell Business appearing on any Honeywell Content as soon as reasonably practicable following the Distribution Date, but in no event later than one hundred and eighty (180) days after the Distribution Date.

(c) Without limiting ARTICLE VIII, the license granted to the SpinCo Group in Section 3.03(a) shall automatically terminate in the event (i) that any member of the SpinCo Group assigns, transfers, licenses or otherwise conveys any rights in or to the Honeywell Content to any third party or (ii) of (x) the sale of all or substantially all of the ownership interests 6

in, or the assets of, any member of the SpinCo Group in a single transaction or a series of related transactions to one or more third parties, (y) any direct or indirect acquisition, consolidation or merger of any member of the SpinCo Group by, with or into any third party or (z) any spin-off, public offering or other corporate reorganization or single transaction or series of related transactions in which direct or indirect control of any member of the SpinCo Group is transferred to one or more third parties, including by transferring an excess of fifty percent (50%) of such member of the SpinCo Group's voting power, shares or equity, through a merger, consolidation, tender offer or similar transaction to one or more third parties.

The retention of any license grants are subject to the Divested Entity's and, in the event it is acquired by a third party, such third party's execution and delivery to the non-transferring Party, within 90 days of the effective date of such divestment, of a duly authorized, written undertaking, agreeing to be bound by the applicable terms of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event will the licenses retained by a Divested Entity extend to products, product lines, services, apparatus, devices, systems, components, hardware, software, processes, solutions, any combination of the foregoing, or other offerings of a third party acquirer existing on or before the date of the divestment, except to the extent that they were licensed under the terms of this Agreement prior to such divestment.

Upon any such determination, any such provision, to the extent determined to be invalid, void or unenforceable, shall be deemed replaced by a provision that such court determines is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid, void or unenforceable provision. 15
