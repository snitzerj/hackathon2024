EMCAP STANDARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF SALE AND ACCEPTANCE OF ORDER

ACCEPTANCE The acceptance of Buyer's order by Seller is expressly made conditional upon Buyer's assent to these Standard Terms and Conditions of Sale. Terms as specified in Seller's Order Confirmation (if any) and these Standard Terms and Conditions shall constitute the only binding contract terms and conditions between the parties (the "Agreement") in the absence of a written agreement as described in the Clause on Written Agreement.

WRITTEN AGREEMENT If there is an executed written sales contract or agreement in effect between Buyer and Seller covering Buyer's order, the terms and conditions of that contract or agreement shall prevail over any conflicting term in Seller's Order Confirmation and/or these Standard Terms and Conditions and/or Buyer's purchase order.

PRICE ADJUSTMENT [*****] Buyer's failure to deliver to Seller written objection to any such change at least ten (10) days before its effective date shall constitute acceptance. If Buyer does deliver such objections within the deadline, no delivery shall be made until parties agree on the new price, freight and/or payment terms.

[*****]

QUANTITY Quantity of all shipments shall be determined by Seller and shall have a shipping allowance of plus or minus five percent (+/-5%) of the quantity indicated in Seller's Order Confirmation or separate sales contract, or such other percentage as determined by Seller. To allow for standard tolerances of scales, Seller will not consider any claims for shortages of less than one half of one percent (0.5%) of the gross weight of any shipment of packaged product or less than one half of one percent (0.5%) of the net weight of bulk shipment. Seller shall have the right at all times to appoint an independent surveyor.

TAXES All prices are exclusive of taxes, duties, or other governmental charges levied on or in respect of the product or delivery thereof. Buyer shall pay or reimburse Seller for such taxes, duties or charges.

RISK AND TITLE TRANSFER Risk of loss of and damage to product shall pass to Buyer in accordance with the Incoterm specified in Seller's Order Confirmation or separate sales contract. Without negating Seller's warranty obligations hereunder, Buyer assumes all risk and liability for loss, damage, or injury to the person or property of Buyer or other parties arising out of the use or possession of any Product sold hereunder. Unless stated otherwise in Seller's Order Confirmation or separate sales contract, title in product shall pass to Buyer simultaneously with risk of loss of and damage to product. However, if the product is shipped by Seller from the US, such title and risk shall pass to Buyer at the first point at which the delivering vessel crosses the outer boundary of the US Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). The EEZ extends 200 nautical miles beyond the coastal baseline defined in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea or as such term is used in the said Convention.

WARRANTIES There are no warranties which extend beyond the description on the face hereof, and Seller makes no warranty, expressed or implied, of satisfactory quality, merchantability, fitness for any particular use or otherwise, except that the products sold hereunder shall meet Seller's applicable standard specifications or such other specifications as may be notified by Seller to Buyer from time to time. Buyer assumes all risk whatsoever as a result of the use of the products purchased, whether used singly or in combination with other substances or in any process.

Without limiting the foregoing, Seller does not recommend nor endorse the use of product in any medical application and specifically disclaims any representation or warranty, express or implied, of suitability or fitness for use, or otherwise with respect to product's use in any medical application. Buyer represents and warrants that no product purchased hereunder will be

used or resold for use in any commercial or developmental manner in connection with medical applications without Seller's prior express written acknowledgment. Further, Buyer agrees that it will make no representations, express or implied, to any person to the effect that Seller recommends or endorses the use of product purchased hereunder in any medical application.

LIMITATION OF CLAIMS Seller's total liability for all claims arising hereunder or connected with the products sold hereunder, whether based in contract, tort or otherwise, shall be no greater than an amount equal to the purchase price of the products to which any such claims relate, or at the Seller's option, and only in the case of claims regarding defective or non-conforming product, to replacement of such products, provided that in all cases Buyer shall be under an obligation to mitigate any loss as far as possible. Seller shall not in any event be liable for any special, incidental, exemplary or consequential damages.

Subject to the Clauses on Quantity, Transfer of Risk and Title Transfer, Buyer shall inspect and test product delivered hereunder for damage, defect or shortage immediately upon receipt and provide Seller notice of any such damage, defect or shortage within ten (10) days of receipt. Any claim must be accompanied by documents as required by Seller, including but not limited to a certified weigh scale ticket or an independent surveyor report, and Seller shall have an opportunity to an independent assessment. All claims for any cause whatsoever, whether based in contract, negligence or other tort, strict liability, breach of warranty or otherwise, shall be deemed waived unconditionally and absolutely unless Seller receives complete written details of such claim not later than [*****] after Buyer's receipt of product as to which such claim is made. Receipt will be deemed to have taken place for purposes of this subparagraph when the product has been loaded onto Buyer's transport, or offloaded from the vessel or other means of transport on which delivery has been made when delivery is arranged by Seller. LAYTIME AND DEMURRAGE Buyer shall unload tank containers, cars, trucks and barges furnished by Seller and clear products from port, or at delivery destination, within the free time specified by tariffs or time periods on file with applicable bodies, or promptly after receipt if no such tariffs or time periods are on file. Buyer shall pay charges resulting from its failure to do to Seller or directly to the common carrier upon receipt of invoice.

Subject to the foregoing, for the first discharge terminal, laytime shall commence six (6) hours after the vessel's notice of readiness is tendered to Buyer (or its agent) or upon the vessel being all fast to the discharge terminal, whichever occurs first, and for subsequent discharge terminal(s), laytime shall commence immediately when the vessel's notice of readiness is tendered to Buyer (or its agent). Laytime shall cease upon disconnection of all cargo hoses upon completion of discharge. For FOB sales, vessels nominated by Buyer are subject to Seller's screening, inspection and acceptance process and Seller's agreement to loading-date range duration / loading-date range narrowing profile / loading-date range communication leadtime and other shipping logistics, and any claim for demurrage by Buyer shall be waived unless notice in writing of such claim is received by Seller with full supporting documentation (including the invoice and time sheet issued by the vessel) by Seller's stipulated deadline.

FAILURE IN PERFORMANCE Failure by Seller to deliver on a specific date shall not entitle Buyer to repudiate this Agreement. Buyer shall not be relieved of any obligations to accept or pay for products by reason of any delay in delivery or dispatch. Furthermore, no liability shall result to either party for delay in performance or non-performance of an obligation hereunder (except an obligation to make payment) in whole or in part caused by circumstances reasonably beyond the control of the party affected, including but not limited to acts of God, terrorist activity, transportation failure, breakdowns, equipment failure, shortage or inability to obtain product or raw material for product, or good-faith compliance with any governmental order or request (whether valid or invalid) . Regardless, however, of the occurrence or nonoccurrence of any such circumstances, if for any reason supplies of product or feedstock for making product, from any of Seller's existing sources are curtailed or are inadequate to meet Seller's own requirement and/or its obligation to its customers, Seller's obligation to deliver product during such period shall be reduced to the extent necessary, in Seller's sole judgment, to apportion fairly among Seller's own requirements and its customers (whether under contract or not) such products as received and as may be available in the ordinary and usual course of Seller's business from any existing sources of supply at the location(s) from which deliveries like those covered hereby are normally shipped. Seller shall not be obligated to purchase or obtain product, or feedstock to make product, to replace deliveries omitted or curtailed under this Paragraph.

Conditions or the details of price, payment, shipment or delivery schedule as communicated by Seller.

Seller shall in any event have the right to set- off any claim that Seller (or its affiliate) may have against Buyer (or its affiliate), against any sum which Seller may owe to Buyer (or its affiliate).

In the event Seller requires a documentary letter of credit or a standby letter of credit, such letter of credit shall be issued by an international bank in form and substance acceptable to Seller.

14. EM gives no guarantees or warranties, express or implied, as to the quality, merchantability, fitness for purpose or suitability of the products except that the product sold pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall meet the relevant EM standard specification in force at the time of loading or such other specification or requirement which may be explicitly agreed in writing between the parties. Without limiting the foregoing, EM does not recommend nor endorse the use of product(s) in any medical application and specifically disclaims any representation or warranty, express or implied, of suitability or fitness for use, or otherwise with respect to product(s)' use in any medical application. Buyer represents and warrants that no product(s) purchased hereunder will be used in or resold into any commercial or developmental manner in connection with medical applications without EM's prior express written acknowledgement. Further, Buyer agrees that it will make no representations, express or implied, to any person to the effect that EM recommends or endorses the use of product(s) purchased hereunder in any medical application.
