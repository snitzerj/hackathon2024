ARTICLE VIII

GOVERNING LAW AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION

8.1 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to any conflict or choice-of-law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware. 8.2 Alternative Dispute Resolution. Any dispute, controversy or claim between or among the Parties (whether sounding in contract, tort, or otherwise) arising out of or resulting from this Agreement, including the meaning of its provisions or the performance of any such provisions by a Party, its breach, termination, invalidity or otherwise (each, a "Dispute") will be resolved in accordance with the procedures specified in this Article VIII, which will be the sole and exclusive procedure for the resolution of any such Dispute. 8.2.1 Negotiations. The Parties will attempt in good faith to resolve any Dispute promptly by negotiations among executives of the Parties who have authority to settle the Dispute. The disputing Party will give the other Party or Parties, as applicable, written notice of the Dispute. Within twenty (20) days after receipt of said notice, the receiving Party or Parties will submit to the other a written response. The notice and response will include: (a) a statement of each Party's position and a summary of the evidence and arguments supporting that position, and (b) the name and title of the executive who will represent that Party. The executives will meet at a mutually acceptable time and place within thirty (30) days of the date of the disputing Party's notice and thereafter as often as they reasonably deem necessary to exchange relevant information and to attempt to resolve the Dispute. 8.2.2 Arbitration. If a Dispute has not been resolved within sixty (60) days of the date of the disputing Party's notice, any Party desiring a non-negotiated resolution shall refer the Dispute to binding arbitration pursuant to the then-current commercial arbitration rules and supplementary procedures of commercial arbitration of the American Arbitration Association (the "AAA Rules"). The arbitral tribunal shall be composed of a single arbitrator appointed in accordance with the AAA Rules in any matter in which an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief is not requested and the value of the relief any Party seeks (whether by claim or counterclaim) does not exceed three million United States dollars (US $3,000,000). In all other matters, including any matter in which an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief is requested, the arbitral tribunal shall be composed of a panel of three (3) arbitrators appointed in accordance with the AAA Rules. The arbitration shall take place in New York, New York. Each Party will bear its own expenses (including attorneys' fees), and the Parties will share equally the compensation and expenses of the arbitrators and the arbitration. Any arbitration award will be final and shall be enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction. 8.3 Confidentiality. All negotiations, and all statements made and documents provided or exchanged in connection with an arbitration under Section 8.2.2 will be confidential. Except with the prior written consent of the other Party or Parties in the Dispute, as applicable, none of the Parties will disclose the existence or content of the Dispute, or the results of any

15





dispute resolution process, to third parties other than (a) as may be required by law or legal process after having provided the other Party or Parties with notice thereof and the opportunity to seek a protective order over such information, or (b) to outside counsel and tax, financial, and accounting professionals in connection with the Dispute. 8.4 Equitable Relief. The Parties acknowledge and agree that monetary damages (even if available) may not be an adequate remedy in the event that a Party does not perform the provisions of this Agreement in accordance with their specified terms or otherwise breaches any provisions of this Agreement. Accordingly, and notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, any Party will be entitled to seek from the arbitrator or arbitration tribunal, and the arbitrator or arbitration tribunal will be empowered to grant, an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief (whether preliminary, permanent, temporary, conservatory or otherwise, and including temporary restraining orders) to prevent such breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which such Party is entitled at law or in equity. The Party alleging the breach shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such award, but the Parties reserve all rights to otherwise contest the propriety of any award of injunctive relief. In addition, and notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, any Party will be entitled to seek in a court of competent jurisdiction an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement pending an arbitration under Section 8.2.2.

(b) UTC may (i) freely sell, assign or otherwise transfer, in whole or from time to time in part, Assigned Intellectual Property Rights assigned to it hereunder; and (ii) sell, assign or otherwise transfer, in whole or from time to time in part, its rights under this Agreement (A) to any member of the UTC Group, (B) to any financing entity, in connection with the grant of a revocable security interest necessary for financing, or (C) to a Person acquiring (whether by asset or stock sale, merger, reorganization or otherwise) all or substantially all of the relevant business of UTC that agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement; but any such transfer or assignment will not relieve UTC of any of its obligations hereunder. 9.2.2 Any purported sale, assignment or other transfer in contravention of this Section 9.2 shall be null and void. 9.2.3 Subject to Section 9.2.1 and Section 9.2.2, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors, assigns and transferees. 9.3 Bankruptcy.

This Agreement may not be modified or amended, except by an instrument or instruments in writing signed by the Party against whom enforcement of any such modification or amendment is sought. Any Party to this Agreement may, only by an instrument in writing, waive compliance by the other Parties with any term or provision of this Agreement on the part of such other Parties to this Agreement to be performed or complied with. The waiver by any Party to this Agreement of a breach of any term or provision of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach. No failure or delay by any Party in exercising any right or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. Subject to Section 3.3, the rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law.
