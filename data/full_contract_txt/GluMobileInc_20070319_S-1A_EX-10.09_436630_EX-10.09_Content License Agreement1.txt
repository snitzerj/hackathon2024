If Licensee fails to reach the Market Penetration Targets Fox shall in its sole discretion have the right to terminate Licensee's exclusivity under this Agreement. In the event of termination of Licensee's exclusivity for Licensee's failure to achieve the Market Penetration Targets, Fox shall not distribute the Wireless Products which have been developed by Licensee prior to such termination, without first obtaining a license from Licensee on terms to be mutually agreed in each party's reasonable discretion, for the exploitation of the Licensee Materials.

(2) Targeted Releases: Fox acknowledges that Licensee may not be able to secure placement of all Targeted Releases at the levels set forth for the Market Penetration Targets defined in the previous sub-Paragraph. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Licensee shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to secure the widest possible distribution of the Wireless Products derived from the Targeted Releases in Europe.

(ii) VGSL and T-Mobile Distribution: For the Territories (as defined in Paragraph 3 below) set forth in Paragraph 2(c)(ii)(A) below, Licensee expressly acknowledges and agrees that Fox has entered into the VGSL Agreement with VGSL for the development of certain Wireless Products as set forth in Paragraph 2(a)(ii) above, and for the distribution of such Wireless Products.

Licensee further acknowledges and agrees that pursuant to the VGSL Agreement and the T-Mobile Agreement, VGSL and T-Mobile will remit directly to Fox all receipts generated from sales of the Wireless Products to VGSL and T-Mobile subscribers. Fox will pass through all such receipts received from VGSL and T-Mobile to Licensee and such receipts shall be treated as Gross Receipts, as defined in Paragraph 7(a)(ii) below, for the purpose of this Agreement. Licensee shall not enter into an exclusive distribution agreement with

a CSP in any of the VGSL Territories listed in Paragraph 2(c)(ii)(A) below, and Fox has not granted and will not grant any exclusive distribution rights to VGSL or T-Mobile. Fox and Licensee will cooperate together in good faith, on a schedule to be mutually agreed, to jointly manage the VGSL and T-Mobile relationships with respect to the Wireless Products, subject to willingness on the parts of VGSL and T-Mobile to so cooperate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any conversations undertaken between Fox and VGSL and/or T-Mobile without Licensee's participation shall not be a breach of this provision.

(iii) Japan Distribution: Upon Fox's notice to Licensee, Licensee shall cease immediately some or all distribution of the Wireless Products in Japan. In the event Fox provides such termination notice to Licensee, Licensee hereby grants Fox a license to the Licensee Materials in order for Fox to distribute the Wireless Products that Licensee has developed for distribution in Japan prior to such termination, either directly or through a third-party. In consideration of such license, Fox shall pay Licensee a royalty as set forth in Paragraph 7(b)(i) below.

(iv) Unless otherwise mutually agreed between Fox and Licensee, Licensee will require each Licensed CSP to distribute Wireless Products to end users only for the payment of a fee; provided that Licensee may permit limited distribution (i.e. one Wireless Product per Property in each category of Wireless Products and including only one game level for each game) of Wireless Products without a fee for promotional or marketing purposes. The fees will typically appear on the end user's Wireless Platform bill and be remitted by the end user to the CSP pursuant to an agreement between the end user and the CSP. The CSP will in turn remit fees to Licensee (less any Deductions as that term is defined in Paragraph 7(a)(ii) below) pursuant to an agreement between Licensee and the CSP. Licensee will then remit royalties to Fox in accordance with Paragraph 7, below.

If Licensee intends to exercise its Right of First Negotiation, it must submit a bid in response to Fox's request within 10 business days. If Licensee does submit a bid, both parties shall negotiate in good faith over the bid for a reasonable period of time, not to exceed 10 additional business days. If the parties have not reached agreement in writing regarding the terms and conditions for the exploitation of the Opportunity within said time period, or if Licensee fails to submit a bid in a timely manner, Fox shall be free to accept any bid from any other party with respect to the Opportunity, or Fox shall be free not to exploit the Opportunity at all. Should Licensee choose to exercise its Right of First Negotiation, its floor bid shall be at least US$***** for each Major Release (as defined in Exhibit N).

5. ADVANCE: Licensee shall pay Fox a non-refundable recoupable advance in the amount of US$***** upon Licensee's signature of this Agreement (the "Advance"). The Advance shall be treated as the first installment of the Guarantee described in Section 6(a), and will be recoupable against royalties as part of the Guarantee.

Each Treatment shall be subject to Fox's approval, which approval is within Fox's discretion. Once a Treatment is approved by Fox and to the extent the approved Treatment requires compatibility input from a Licensed CSP, it shall be Licensee's sole responsibility to secure concept approval from such Licensed CSP. If the Licensed CSP requires changes, modifications or alterations to a Treatment, or to any element of the Wireless Products, Licensee shall seek Fox's written approval of any such change, which approval may be withheld in Fox's sole discretion.

(iii) Design Document: Once a given Treatment is approved by Fox, Licensee shall then submit to Fox a game design document ("Design Document") which will lay out the creative and technical aspects for the Wireless Product, including how Licensee intends to use the Property and the PSM in the Wireless Product. The Design Document shall be subject to Fox's written approval, which approval is within Fox's sole discretion.

(iv) Alpha Testing: Upon approval of the Design Document by Fox, Licensee shall submit a prototype of the applicable Wireless Product, which demonstrates all of the features and functions set forth in the Design Document, although colors, graphics and related elements need not be in their final form (each, an "Alpha Prototype").

(A) Modifications: After approval of a Beta Prototype, Licensee shall not modify the Wireless Products without the prior written approval of Fox. For purposes of this paragraph, porting, enhancements, optimization (which alters the content displayed in any material manner) and localization shall be deemed a modification requiring Fox's prior written approval.

Wireless Products, then Fox and Licensee shall mutually and in good faith discuss and agree to any adjustments in the Wireless Products Latest Commencement Date which are necessary due to such delay.

Licensee hereby does irrevocably transfer and assign to Fox any and all Moral Rights that Licensee may have in Fox's Intellectual Property Rights in and to the PSM and the Fox Intellectual Property and any derivative works thereof and shall cause Licensee's employees and contractors, including Licensee's developers of the Wireless Products, to do likewise. Licensee hereby does forever waive and agree never to assert any and all Moral Rights it may have in Fox's Intellectual Property Rights in and to the PSM and the Fox Intellectual Property and any derivative works thereof and shall cause its employees and contractors (including the developers) to do likewise.

If either party's use or exploitation of any materials provided and licensed hereunder is, or in the licensor's opinion is likely to be, enjoined due to the type of claim specified in Paragraphs 13(a) or (b), above, the licensor may, at its sole option and expense: (a) procure for the licensee the right to continue using such rights under the terms of this Agreement; (b) replace or modify any materials provided so that they are non-infringing; or (c) if options (a) and (b) above cannot be accomplished despite the licensor's reasonable efforts, then the licensor may terminate the licensee's rights and the licensor's obligations hereunder with respect to such materials, in which event the licensor will refund to the licensee any amounts paid by the licensee with respect to such materials. For the avoidance of doubt, Licensee is the licensor of the Licensee Materials, pursuant to Paragraph 1(e), for the purpose of this Paragraph.

    (d) Sole Remedy. THE PROVISIONS OF THIS PARAGRAPH 14 SET FORTH EACH PARTY'S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE OBLIGATIONS AND REMEDIES WITH RESPECT TO THIRD PARTY CLAIMS OF INFRINGEMENT OR MISAPPROPRIATION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF ANY KIND UNLESS OTHERWISE STIPULATED BY JUDICIAL ORDER.

15.  TERMINATION:

    (a) Termination Rights;

      (i) Bankruptcy: If Licensee's liabilities exceed its assets, or if Licensee becomes unable to pay its debts as they become due, or files or has filed against Licensee a petition in bankruptcy, reorganization or for the adoption of an arrangement under any present or future bankruptcy, reorganization or similar law (which petition if filed against Licensee shall not be dismissed within 30 days from the filing date), or if Licensee makes an assignment for the benefit of its creditors or is adjudicated a bankrupt, or if a receiver or trustee of all or substantially all of Licensee's property is appointed, or if Licensee discontinues its business, this Agreement shall automatically terminate forthwith without notice to Licensee.

      (ii) Transfer or Change of Control: If a substantial portion of the assets or controlling stock in Licensee's business is sold or transferred, or if there is a substantial change in Licensee's management, or if Licensee's property is expropriated, confiscated or nationalized by any government or if any government assumes de facto control of Licensee's business, in whole or in part, Fox may terminate this Agreement upon 30 days' notice to Licensee.

      (iii) Unauthorized Uses: If Licensee transfers, sells or distributes to any unauthorized third party any artwork, voice clips, or other Fox proprietary materials related to the Property including but not limited to Marketing Materials, then Fox may terminate this Agreement forthwith on written notice without any cure period.

      (iv) Failure to Exploit: If Licensee fails to exploit the PSM as set forth in Paragraph 2(a) and 2(b), or fails to release the Wireless Products in accordance with the dates set forth in Paragraph 2(b), then Fox may terminate this Agreement forthwith on written notice without any cure period subject to the terms and conditions set forth in Paragraph 2(a) and 2(b), respectively.

      (v) Failure to Obtain Approvals: If Licensee releases a Wireless Product without first obtaining Fox's approval as specifically set forth in this Agreement in Paragraph 9, then Fox may terminate this Agreement forthwith on written notice without any cure period.

      (vi) Other Defaults: Excepting only those Licensee defaults in this Paragraph 15 which permit Fox to terminate immediately without any cure period for Licensee, if either party fails to perform any of its material obligations hereunder, the other party may terminate this Agreement upon 30 days' notice, unless the breaching party cures any such breach within said 30 days and gives notice to the other party thereof within that period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that either party (A) fails to pay Royalties or other amounts when due, or (B) fails to make Royalty or other accountings in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, then the breaching party shall be subject to a one-time cure period of fifteen (15) days for such breach. If a party fails to cure the breach within such fifteen (15)-day period or another breach of either (A) or (B) above occurs following an initial cure within the fifteen (15)-day period, then the other party shall have the right in its sole discretion to terminate this Agreement forthwith on written notice without any cure period.

      (vii) Other Agreements: Should any event of default by Licensee cause Fox to terminate this Agreement, Fox, in its sole discretion, may terminate, without any cure period, any other agreements concurrently existing between Fox and Licensee upon written notice specifying the agreements to be terminated. For the avoidance of doubt, this remedy shall only apply to any agreements concurrently existing between the specific parties to this Agreement and shall not apply to agreements between Licensee and Fox Sports.

    (b) Effect of Termination/Expiration: In the event of termination of this Agreement, Licensee shall: (i) immediately stop in all respects the sale and distribution of the Wireless Products and provide Fox with a complete inventory report and accounting with

Wireless Content License Agreement Multiple Properties / Sorrent, Inc. / Final PLZ

    payment of all Royalties, and (ii) at Fox's election shall either (A) deliver to Fox all materials related to the Wireless Products or (B) give Fox satisfactory evidence of their destruction. Licensee agrees that its failure to stop in all respects the sale and/or distribution of the Wireless Products upon termination or expiration of the Agreement will result in immediate irreparable damage to Fox for which there is no adequate remedy at law, and in the event of such failure by Licensee, Fox shall be entitled to injunctive relief. Fox's exercise of any of the foregoing remedies shall not operate as a waiver of any other rights or remedies which Fox may have. Fox shall not distribute the Wireless Products after the termination or expiration of this Agreement without obtaining from Licensee a separate license to the Licensee Materials.

(i) Sell-Off Period: Notwithstanding Paragraph 15(b), in the event of termination of this Agreement, Licensee shall have a period of ***** from the date of such termination (unless such termination occurs less than ***** prior to the expiration of this Agreement in which case the time period shall be shortened accordingly so as not to exceed the date of expiration) in which to sell-off existing inventory of Wireless Products already in the Distribution Channels ("Sell Off Period"). Licensee agrees that no additional Wireless Products may be developed or distributed during the Sell Off Period and Licensee agrees to require that any Licensed CSP to comply with this provision. Upon the expiration of the Sell Off Period, Licensee agrees to destroy all such remaining inventory and confirm same in writing to Fox (and require that any Licensed CSP do the same). Any revenues, credits or other consideration received by Licensee for the Wireless Products during the Sell Off Period will be subject to Licensee's obligation to pay Fox Royalties pursuant to Paragraph 7 above.

(ii) Fox's Development of Wireless Products: In the event of termination or expiration of this Agreement or Licensee's loss of exclusive rights under this Agreement, Fox shall be free to create and exploit, or have a third party create or exploit, wireless products which may be similar to those developed and distributed by Licensee pursuant to this Agreement for the Properties.

    (c) Guarantee Forfeiture: In the event of termination of this Agreement and without limitation of Fox's rights and remedies all of which are expressly reserved, the following payment penalties shall apply: (i) if termination occurs in the first year of the Term, Licensee shall forfeit any Guarantee paid, and shall immediately pay any remaining Guarantee, up to the amount of ***** dollars (US$*****), and any Guarantee payments made in excess of ***** dollars ($*****) shall be refunded by Fox to Licensee; and (ii) if termination occurs in the second year of the Term, Licensee shall forfeit any Guarantee paid, and shall immediately pay any remaining portion of the Guarantee then unpaid, up to the amount of ***** dollars (US$*****). Any forfeited Guarantees will apply as a set off against any additional damages claimed by Fox.

Glossary

"MMS" stands for Multimedia Messaging Service — a store and forward messaging service that allows mobile subscribers to exchange multimedia messages with other mobile subscribers. MMS supports the transmission of additional media types: text, picture, audio, video and combinations of them.

"Realtone" or "Trutone" (also referred to as Master Tone) shall mean a digital, audio file containing an excerpt of a master recording of a musical composition, no more than 45 seconds in length, formatted for playback by a wireless device when such wireless device receives an incoming call.

"Screensaver" shall mean a Java application that replaces the image on a screen when the screen is not in use.

"Wallpaper" on a mobile phone shall mean the background pattern or picture against which mobile phone screen menus, icons, and other elements are displayed and moved around. A wallpaper image can be in a JPEG or a GIF file format. Each model/make of the mobile phone provides several pre- installed wallpaper images for the user to choose from. A user can also choose to download and install third-party wallpapers and use one of these instead.

"Voicetone" shall mean the audio speech sound heard by a caller, such as lines from a movie or spoken lyrics of a song.

"Ringtone" shall mean a digital, audio file containing a portion of a musical composition, no more than 45 seconds in length, formatted for playback by a wireless device when such wireless device receives an incoming call. For the avoidance of doubt, a Ring Tone may be either monophonic or polyphonic.

News America Incorporated Statement of Privacy Principles

PREAMBLE

News America Incorporated ("News America") is the principal U.S. subsidiary of The News Corporation Limited, one of the world's largest media companies. The businesses of News America and its subsidiary, Fox Entertainment Group, Inc., include: the production and distribution of motion pictures, television programming and related consumer products (Twentieth Century Fox); television and cable broadcasting (the Fox Network, Fox owned television stations, Fox Sports Net, Fox Sports World, Fox Sports World Espaňol, Speedvision, Fox News Channel, FX and Fox Movie Channel); the publication of newspapers, books, magazines and promotional free-standing inserts (The New York Post, HarperCollins Publishers, The Weekly Standard and News America Marketing); sports franchises (the Los Angeles Dodgers); and marketing services (SmartSource/iGroup). In this Statement of Privacy Principles these businesses are collectively called the News America Group. At the News America Group we strive to enhance our relationship with consumers. Collecting personal information about consumers is vital to this effort. This Statement of Privacy Principles describes the policies and procedures of the News America Group's U.S.-based businesses for the collection, use, and dissemination of personally identifiable information about U.S. consumers in both the online and offline world. The Principles are based on the concepts of consumer notice and choice.* The News America Group is actively involved in the ongoing privacy debate and is continually monitoring privacy developments. Accordingly, from time to time we may modify these Privacy Principles to reflect changes in the law, self-regulatory initiatives and technology.

COLLECTION

The News America Group obtains personally identifiable information only if we believe the information is relevant to our relationship with a consumer or to assist us in creating a relationship with a consumer. We obtain personally identifiable information about consumers directly from consumers whenever possible, primarily in the course of providing them with products, information and services. When the News America Group obtains personally identifiable information from third-party sources, we use only reputable sources. In those instances where our information collection activities involve children, the News America Group provides special privacy protections.

NOTICE

When The News America Group collects personally identifiable information from consumers, we inform them about who is collecting the information, why it is being collected, how it is being collected, the types of uses we will make of the information, whether we will disclose the information to third parties and the types of third parties to whom we will disclose the information, and consumers' options regarding the use of their information.

CHOICE

The News America Group provides consumers with an opportunity to choose whether the business unit that collects their personally identifiable information may use it for purposes that are other than those for which the information was submitted, and whether the information may be shared with third parties.

USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

Inside the News America Group, we use personally identifiable information only in a manner consistent with these Privacy Principles. Personally identifiable information is available only to our employees, agents and contractors who have a business reason to have access to such information. The News America Group uses personally identifiable information to respond to our customers and to make decisions about the goods and services that the News America Group or its business partners provide or hope to provide to consumers. Subject to the exercise of consumer choice, personally identifiable information may be used for different purposes, or shared with our business partners. A News America Group business entity may disclose personally identifiable information without providing consumers with a choice in order to protect the rights of the companies within the News America Group or their respective employees, agents and contractors; to protect the safety and security of visitors to web sites operated by News America Group companies; to protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; or to comply with the law or legal process. In addition, if a News America Group entity sells all or part of one of its businesses, makes a sale or transfer of assets or is otherwise involved in a business merger or transfer, personally identifiable information may be transferred to a third party as part of that transaction.

SECURITY

The News America Group uses reasonable administrative, technical, personnel, and physical measures to safeguard personally identifiable information in its possession against loss, theft, and unauthorized use, disclosure or modification.

ACCESS, CORRECTION AND DELETION

Whenever possible, each News America Group business unit permits consumers to have a right to see the personally identifiable information that it has collected from them, to correct any information that is incorrect and to instruct the business unit to delete the information from its files.

REMEDIES

Consumers may contact a privacy officer at each News America Group business unit regarding privacy complaints and disputes.

COMPLIANCE

Each News America Group company will take appropriate measures to ensure compliance with these Privacy Principles.
