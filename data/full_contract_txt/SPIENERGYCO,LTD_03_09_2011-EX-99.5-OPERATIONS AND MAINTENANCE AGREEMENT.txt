None of Service Provider's employees shall be, or shall be  considered to be, employees of Owner.

All work associated with Non- Covered Services will be billed according to the terms of Section 2.2. Any studies or other services required by Owner to review options to  optimize system performance will be provided as Non-Covered Services.

(b) The Performance of any Non-Covered Services by Service Provider shall require a written request from Owner specifying the Non-Covered  Services to be performed by Service Provider. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if (i) the costs of Non-Covered Services to be performed by Service  Provider do not exceed $500.00 in any single instance, or (ii) the Non-Covered Services are provided by Service Provider on an emergency basis to  prevent an imminent danger of injury, loss, or damage (exceeding $500.00), Service Provider shall attempt to notify Owner via telephone prior to the  performance of any Non-Covered Services and shall be authorized to proceed with the performance of such Non-Covered Services upon receiving  verbal approval from Owner.
